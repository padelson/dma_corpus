ARTICLE II.

CONTRIBUTION; PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS; CLOSING

Section 2.1.  _Reorganization; Contribution of CTG Business Assets_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the CAG Parties, as appropriate,
shall consummate the transactions described in _Schedule 2.1_ attached hereto
together with the transactions contemplated by the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement (the _"Reorganization_ "); _provided_ _that_ no Person shall be
required to consummate any portion of the Reorganization unless all other
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or waived
in writing and each of the Parties is prepared to consummate the Closing
immediately following the Reorganization.

(b) With respect to any agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-
of-way or permit which (1) is material to the operation of the CTG Business
as it is currently operated by CTG, (2) is intended to be contributed to the
LLCs pursuant to the Reorganization and (3) requires consent for the
assignment and contribution thereof to the LLCs or requires consent in
connection with the sale of the Transferred LLC Interests to Investor
hereunder, the CAG Parties shall take (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to take) such actions as are commercially reasonable
and necessary, and Investor shall cooperate with the CAG Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries on a commercially reasonable and necessary basis, to
obtain such consents and to effect the assignment and contribution thereof to
the LLCs on or before the Closing Date. In the event that the CAG Parties or
any of their respective Subsidiaries are unable to obtain the requisite
approval for the assignment and contribution of any such agreement, contract,
license, lease, easement, right-of-way or permit, or in the event such
agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-of-way or permit is
required to be amended or supplemented and is not so amended or supplemented
as of the Closing Date, at the request of Investor (except where such action
would be unlawful or prohibited by such agreement, contract, license, lease,
easement, right-of-way or permit), the CAG Parties shall (x) retain any such
agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-of-way or permit and
shall in good faith enter into an arrangement with the LLCs, reasonably
acceptable to each of the Parties, to provide the LLCs with the benefits of
such agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-of-way or permit,
_provided_ _that_ the LLCs shall perform the CAG Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries obligations thereunder arising on and after the
Closing Date (and indemnify the CAG Parties and their respective Subsidiaries
against any Losses suffered in connection therewith pursuant to _Section
9.3(c)_ ) until such agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-of-
way or permit is assigned to the LLCs or expires at the earliest opportunity
in accordance with its terms, or is properly amended or supplemented, and (y)
take all commercially reasonable actions required to  



 

-20-  assign to the LLCs, or amend or supplement any such agreement, contract,
license, lease, easement, right-of-way or permit as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date. Each of the CAG Parties and the LLCs shall report to the
other Party, as reasonably requested by the other Party, on the status of its
efforts pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_ and the Parties shall work jointly
to cause such assignment to occur and the release of CAG and any of its
Subsidiaries from any obligations under such agreement, contract, license,
lease, easement, right-of-way or permit,

(c) Notwithstanding the CAG Parties obligations pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_
, the assignment of any agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-
of-way or permit to be transferred to the LLCs which requires consent for
assignment, or amendment or supplement, may be effected after the Closing
Date. Except as otherwise provided herein, the closing of the
Contemplated Transactions shall not be delayed, by reason of any inability to
obtain consent for assignment of any agreement, contract, license, lease,
easement, right-of-way or permit or any such amendment or supplement. Any
agreement, contract, license, lease, easement, right-of-way or permit that
may not be properly assigned to the LLCs because of the failure to obtain a
required consent or that may not be operated or used by the CAG Parties for
the LLCs benefit shall not be included in the assets to be transferred to
the LLCs in the Reorganization; provided that the foregoing shall not affect
the rights of Investor pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement with
respect to the failure to obtain any such required consent or the inability
of the CAG Parties to so operate or use for the LLCs benefit.

Section 2.2. _Purchase and Sale of Equity Interests in CTG Business_. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, effective
as of the Closing, in exchange for the Purchase Price: (a) the CAG Parties
shall sell, transfer and deliver to Investor, and Investor shall purchase
from the CAG Parties all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the
LLCs (the " _Transferred LLC Interests_ "); and (b) CAG shall cause the CTG
Foreign Sellers to sell, transfer and deliver, or cause to be
sold, transferred and delivered, to Foreign Buyer, 100% (90% in the case of
Compania Terminal de Tuxpan, S.A. de C.V.) of the stock or other Equity
Interests in the CTG Foreign Companies (the _"Transferred Foreign Interests_ "
and, together with the Transferred LLC Interests, the _"Transferred
Interests_ ").

Section 2.3. _Payment of Purchase Price by Investor_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the aggregate purchase price to be paid by Investor and Foreign
Buyer to the CAG Parties and CTG Foreign Sellers for the Transferred Interests
(the _"Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount equal to the sum of the (a)
Closing Net Equity Book Value with respect to the Transferred Companies plus
(b) six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000) plus (c) if (i) Investor issues
Purchase Price PIK Notes at the Closing and (ii) the Company does not obtain
the Ratings, or one or both of the Ratings are not Investment Grade Ratings,
the Ratings Adjustment Amount, which shall be paid in cash. The portion of the
Purchase Price payable with respect to each CTG Foreign Company shall be
equal to each CTG Foreign Companys net book value as shown on the Closing
Balance Sheet. CAG will determine and direct the allocation of the Purchase
Price between CAG and CFFIC, subject to the approval of Investor
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that at least five hundred fifty million dollars
($550,000,000) of the Purchase Price must be allocated to CFFIC. The portion
of the Purchase Price payable to CAG for the interests in Freebird will be
paid in cash. The portion of the Purchase Price payable to CFFIC for the
interests in Freebird II shall, at the option of Investor, be payable in cash
or be payable in Purchase Price PIK Notes in an



 

-21-  aggregate principal amount equal to 25% of the Purchase Price; _provided_
_that_ to the extent the Purchase Price payable at the Closing is less than
two billion one hundred million dollars ($2,100,000,000), then the original
aggregate principal amount of the Purchase Price PIK Notes shall be equal to
five hundred twenty-five million dollars ($525,000,000), and to the extent the
Purchase Price payable at the Closing is greater than two billion two hundred
million dollars ($2,200,000,000), then the original aggregate principal amount
of the Purchase Price PIK Notes shall be equal to five hundred fifty million
dollars ($550,000,000); and _provided_ _further_ that for purposes of this
sentence only, all references to Purchase Price shall be deemed to exclude
that portion of the Purchase Price attributable to (i) the increase in Closing
Net Equity Book Value resulting from payment of Fertilizer Payables during
the period beginning ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing and ending three
(3) Business Days prior to Closing and (ii) the Ratings Adjustment Amount, if
applicable.

 

Section 2.4. _Closing_. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the Reorganization) (the _"Closing_ ") shall
be held at 10:00 a.m. Central Time on the first day that is at least two (2)
Business Days after, each of the conditions precedent set forth in _Articles
V_ and  _VI_ has been satisfied or waived (other than conditions relating to
deliveries of documentation at Closing; _provided_ _that_ all such conditions
are satisfied or waived at Closing), or at such other time as CAG and Investor
shall agree in writing. The Closing (the date of Closing, the _"Closing Date_
") shall be held at the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York,

Governmental Body, to change the name of such Person to the name set forth
opposite such Persons name on _Schedule 2.5(e)_ , or, if no such name is
indicated, a name that does not include a reference to ConAgra or CTG.

Section 2.6. _Final Balance Sheet; Payments; Disputes._

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than
ninety (90) days thereafter, CAG shall prepare and deliver (with assistance as
reasonably requested from the LLCs) to Investor, a combined balance sheet of
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries (the _"Proposed
Final Balance Sheet_ ") as of the Closing Date. The Proposed Final Balance
Sheet shall reflect the Closing Net Equity Book Value together with the
Agreed Adjustments (the _"Proposed Final Net Equity Book Value_ ") of the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as of 12:01 a.m.
Central Time on the Closing Date and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
on a basis consistent with the Closing Balance Sheet (but including the
Agreed Adjustments).

(b) Investor will have forty-five (45) Business Days following delivery of
the Proposed Final Balance Sheet during which to notify CAG in writing (the "
_Investor Notice of Objection_ ") of any objections to the preparation of the
Proposed Final Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Proposed Final Net
Equity Book Value, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of its
objections and, if practical, the U.S. dollar amount of each objection. In
reviewing the Proposed Final Balance Sheet, Investor shall be entitled to
reasonable access to all relevant books, records and personnel of the LLCs,
the CTG Companies and their respective Representatives to the extent Investor
reasonably requests such information and reasonable access to complete its
review of the Proposed Final Balance Sheet. If Investor fails to deliver an
Investor Notice of Objection in accordance with this _Section 2.6(b)_ , the
Proposed Final Balance Sheet, together with CAGs calculation of the Proposed
Final Net Equity Book Value reflected thereon, shall be conclusive and
binding on all Parties and they shall become the " _Final Balance Sheet_ " and
_"Final Net Equity Book Value_." If Investor submits an Investor Notice of
Objection, then (i) for twenty (20) Business Days after the date CAG receives
the Investor Notice of Objection, Investor and CAG will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to agree on the calculation of the Final Net Equity Book
Value and (ii) failing such agreement within twenty (20) Business Days of
such notice, the matter will be resolved in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_.

(c) Any amounts remaining in dispute at the conclusion of such twenty (20)
Business Day period that were properly included in the Investor Notice of
Objection (the " _Unresolved Changes_ ") shall be submitted to
PricewaterhouseCoopers or such other international accounting or financial
services firm as the Parties shall otherwise agree (the _"Expert_ "). If
Investor and CAG are unable to mutually agree on an Expert, Investor and CAG
shall select Deloitte and Touche. CAG and Investor agree to execute, if
requested by the Expert, a reasonable engagement letter. Within ten (10)
Business Days of the selection of the Expert, Investor and CAG will each
deliver to the other and to the Expert a notice setting forth in reasonable
detail their calculation of the Final Net Equity Book Value. The Expert shall
act as an arbitrator to determine, based on the provisions of this _Section
2.6_ and the definitions referred to herein, only  



 

-25-  the Unresolved Changes. The Expert shall be instructed to determine its best
estimate of the calculation of the Final Net Equity Book Value based on
its determination of the Unresolved Changes, which estimate shall be no
higher than the higher of the Parties calculations nor lower than the lower
of the Parties calculations, and provide a written description of the basis
for such determination within forty-five (45) Business Days after such matter
has been submitted to the Expert, which written determination shall be final,
binding and conclusive. Each of the parties shall furnish, at its own expense,
the Expert and the other Party with such documents and other written
information as the Expert may request. Each Party may also furnish to the
Expert such other written information and documents as such Party deems
relevant; _provided_ , _that_ copies of all such documents and materials
shall be concurrently delivered to the other Party in the same manner as such
materials are delivered to the Expert. The Expert may, at its discretion,
conduct one or more conferences with respect to the dispute between the
Parties, at which conference each Party shall have the right to present such
additional documents, materials and other information and to be accompanied or
represented by such Representatives as each Party shall choose in its sole
discretion. The fees and expenses of the Expert shall be paid pro rata by
Investor and CAG in accordance with the percentage of the disputed amounts
awarded to the other Party as a result of the Experts decision. Each Party
will bear the costs of its own counsel, witnesses (if any) and employees.

(d) If the Final Net Equity Book Value exceeds the Closing Net Equity Book
Value, Investor shall pay (within ten (10) Business Days) an amount equal to
such excess by wire transfer in immediately available funds to CAG and CFFIC
to one or more accounts (and in such amounts) as specified by CAG. If the
Final Net Equity Book Value is less than the Closing Net Equity Book Value,
CAG and CFFIC shall pay, within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of such
Final Balance Sheet, an amount equal to such deficit to Investor by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by Investor.

(e) The dispute resolution provisions of this Section 2.6 shall not apply to,
and the scope of the Experts authority herein shall not extend to, any
dispute of the Parties relating to the interpretation, breach or enforcement
of any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 2.7. _Additional Amounts_.

(a) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this  _Section 2.7_ ,
Investor shall pay to the CAG Parties, as additional Purchase Price hereunder,
the Earn-Out Amount (defined below) achieved in respect of each full or
partial quarterly Fiscal Period that ends after the Closing,
beginning immediately following the Closing and through and including
December 21, 2008 (each such quarterly Fiscal Period or partial quarterly
Fiscal Period, an _"Earn-Out Period_ "); _provided_ _that_ such full or
partial quarterly Fiscal Periods shall be based on CAGs quarterly Fiscal
Periods. The _"Earn-Out Amount_ " achieved in each Earn-Out Period shall be
based upon the aggregate Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits (as defined in _Section
2.7(b)_ ) of the LLCs and its Subsidiaries for such Earn-Out Period and shall
be equal to the product of (i) 0.5 and (ii) the excess, if any, of such
Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits over $36,000,000 for each full or partial quarterly
Fiscal Period that ends after the Closing and through and including December
21, 2008; _provided that_ with respect to the first (if the Closing does not
occur on the first day of a quarterly Fiscal Period) and last Earn-Out
Periods, such $36,000,000 threshold shall be prorated for the actual number
of days of such Earn-Out Period as compared to the actual number of days  



 

-26-  in such quarterly Fiscal Period; _provided_ _further_ that in no event shall
the aggregate Earn-Out Amounts due to the CAG Parties pursuant to this 
_Section 2.7_ exceed an amount equal to (i) $150,000,000 _less_ (ii) the sum
of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits, if any, of the CTG Business for
the period from January 21, 2008 to the Closing (the _"Earn-Out Cap_ ").

(b)

(i) " _Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits_ " means, with respect to any Earn-Out Period,
the profit before tax of the LLCs and their Subsidiaries (or with respect to
any period prior to the Closing, the CTG Business), in each case determined
on a consolidated basis in accordance with the accounting principles utilized
in preparing the audited combined balance sheets of the CTG Business as of May
27, 2007 and the related combined statement of operations and cash flows
for the year ended May 27, 2007, including any notes thereto), as adjusted to
exclude the effect of the following items:



     | (1) | purchase accounting and other similar step-up adjustments,
including related depreciation charges; 
---|---|--- 


     | (2) | amortization and other transaction and transaction financing
costs (including one-time costs relating to the LLCs financing for post-
Closing operations) and any post-Closing interest expense other than interest
expense related to the ABL Financing that does not constitute CTG Purchase
Price Debt (including letters of credit charges); 
---|---|--- 


     | (3) | pre-tax profits from any business or businesses acquired
after the Closing and all related financing costs for such business or
businesses, including for acquisition financing;  
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | interest expense due to borrowings that do not fund the
LLCs and their Subsidiaries operations or debt service requirements; 
---|---|--- 


     | (5) | charges resulting from any one-time items as mutually agreed
by the CAG Parties and Investor; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (6) | any management fees or other similar fees payable to Ospraie
Advisors or any of its Affiliates; 
---|---|--- 
_provided_ _further_ , that only the amount of pre-tax profits in excess of
any mark to market adjustment made under the Agreed Adjustments as set forth
on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ will be considered in determining the Earn-Out Amount
under this _Section 2.7_.

(ii) _"Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits_ " means the profit before tax of
the CTG Business, determined on a consolidated basis consistent with the
historical internal management reporting practices of CTG and the calculation
 



 

-27-  methodology set forth on _Schedule 2.7(b)(ii)_ attached hereto. As promptly
as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date, CAG shall in good faith prepare and deliver to Investor a written
computation of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for the period from
January 21, 2008 to the Closing. CAG shall permit Investor and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers) pertaining to or used in connection with
CAGs determination of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such
period and provide Investor with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by
Investor). If Investor disagrees with CAGs determination of the Pre-Closing
Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such period, Investor shall notify CAG in writing
of such disagreement (a _"Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits Objection
Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after Investors receipt of CAGs
determination of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such period. The
Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits Objection Notice should set forth
Investors computation of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such
period and describe in reasonable detail the basis for its disagreement with
CAGs computation. The CAG Parties and Investor shall thereafter negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such disagreements. If Investor and the CAG Parties
are unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after
Investors delivery of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits Objection
Notice, Investor and the CAG Parties shall submit all unresolved disagreements
to the Expert. If Investor and CAG are unable to mutually agree on an Expert,
Investor and CAG shall select Deloitte and Touche. Investor and the CAG Parties
agree to execute, if requested by the Expert, a reasonable engagement letter.
Within ten (10) Business Days of the selection of the Expert, Investor and the
CAG Parties will each deliver to the other and to the Expert a notice setting
forth in reasonable detail their calculation of the Pre-Closing Adjusted Pre-
Tax Profits for such period. The Expert shall act as an arbitrator to
determine, based on the provisions of this _Section 2.7_ and the definitions
referred to herein, only the amount remaining in dispute. The Expert shall be
instructed to determine its best estimate of the calculation of the Pre-
Closing Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such period based on its determination of
the amount remaining in dispute, which estimate shall be no higher than the
higher of the Parties calculations nor lower than the lower of the Parties
calculations, and provide a written description of the basis for such
determination within thirty (30) days after such matter has been submitted to
the Expert, which written determination shall be final, binding and
conclusive. Each of the Parties shall furnish, at its own expense, the Expert
and the other Party with such documents and other written information as the
Expert may request. Each Party may also furnish to the Expert such other
written information and documents as such Party deems relevant; _provided_ ,
_that_ copies of all such documents and materials shall be concurrently
delivered to the other Party in the same manner as such materials are
delivered to the Expert. The Expert may, at its discretion, conduct one or
more conferences with respect to the dispute between the Parties, at which
conference each Party shall have the right to present such additional
documents, materials and other information and to be accompanied or
represented by such Representatives as  



 

-28-  each Party shall choose in its sole discretion. The fees and expenses of the
Expert shall be paid pro rata by Investor and the CAG Parties in accordance
with the percentage of the disputed amounts awarded to the other Party as a
result of the Experts decision. Each Party will bear the costs of its own
counsel, witnesses (if any) and employees.

(c) As promptly as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days following
the end of each Earn-Out Period following the Closing Date, Investor shall in
good faith prepare and deliver to the CAG Parties a written computation of the
Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such Earn-Out Period. The LLCs and Investor shall
permit the CAG Parties and their Representatives to have reasonable access to
the books, records and other documents (including work papers) pertaining to
or used in connection with Investors determination of the Adjusted Pre-Tax
Profits for such Earn-Out Period and provide the CAG Parties with copies
thereof (as reasonably requested by the CAG Parties). If the CAG Parties
disagree with Investors determination of the Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for
such Earn-Out Period, the CAG Parties shall notify Investor in writing of such
disagreement (an _"Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits Objection Notice_ ") within
thirty (30) days after the CAG Parties receipt of Investors determination of
the Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such Earn-Out Period. All Adjusted Pre-Tax
Profits Objection Notices should set forth the CAG Parties computation of
the Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for such Earn-Out Period and describe in
reasonable detail the basis for their disagreement with Investors
computation. The CAG Parties and Investor shall thereafter negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such disagreements. If Investor and the CAG Parties are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the CAG
Parties delivery of the Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits Objection Notice, Investor
and the CAG Parties shall submit all unresolved disagreements to the Expert.
If Investor and CAG are unable to mutually agree on an Expert, Investor and
CAG shall select Deloitte and Touche. Investor and the CAG Parties agree to
execute, if requested by the Expert, a reasonable engagement letter. Within
ten (10) Business Days of the selection of the Expert, Investor and the CAG
Parties will each deliver to the other and to the Expert a notice
setting forth in reasonable detail their calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Tax
Profits for such Earn-Out Period. The Expert shall act as an arbitrator to
determine, based on the provisions of this Section _2.7_ and the definitions
referred to herein, only the amount remaining in dispute. The Expert shall be
instructed to determine its best estimate of the calculation of the Adjusted
Pre-Tax Profits for such Earn-Out Period based on its determination of the
amount remaining in dispute, which estimate shall be no higher than the
higher of the Parties\' calculations nor lower than the lower of the Parties
calculations, and provide a written description of the basis for such
determination within thirty (30) days after such matter has been submitted to
the Expert, which written determination shall be final, binding and
conclusive. Each of the Parties shall furnish, at its own expense, the Expert
and the other Party with such documents and other written information as
the Expert may request. Each Party may also furnish to the Expert such other
written information and documents as such Party deems relevant; _provided_ ,
_that_ copies of all such documents and materials shall be concurrently
delivered to the other Party in the same manner as such materials are
delivered to the Expert. The Expert may, at its discretion, conduct one or
more conferences with respect to the dispute between the Parties, at which
conference each Party shall have the right to present such additional
documents, materials and other information and to be accompanied or
represented by such Representatives as each Party shall choose in its sole
discretion. The fees and expenses of the Expert shall be paid pro rata by
Investor and the CAG Parties in accordance with the percentage of the
disputed amounts awarded to the other Party as a result of the Experts
decision. Each Party will bear the costs of its own counsel, witnesses (if
any) and employees.



 

-29- (d) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the Adjusted Pre-Tax Profits for an Earn-Out Period is finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ or _Section 2.7(c)_ , Investor shall pay to the
CAG Parties an amount equal to the Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period
(as determined in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)_ ); _provided that_ any
Earnout Amount PIK Notes payable hereunder will be allocated between CFFIC and
CAG based on the relative earnings of the LLCs. Such payment shall be made as
follows:

(i) the first $50,000,000 of all Earn-Out Amounts shall be paid, at the
election of Investor, either by (i) wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by the CAG Parties or (ii) the issuance to
CFFIC of 10.75% Earnout Amount PIK Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
such Earn-Out Amounts;

(ii) the next $50,000,000 of such Earn-Out Amounts shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the
CAG Parties; _provided_ _that_ to the extent and only to the extent that the
payment of such cash amount would result in a default under the credit
facility for the ABL Financing as in effect at the Closing (as certified by
the chief financial officer of Investor), if the Investor elected to pay a
portion of the Purchase Price in PIK Notes, such amounts shall be paid by the
issuance to CFFIC of 10.75% Earnout Amount PIK Notes in the aggregate
principal amount of such Earn-Out Amounts; and

(iii) all remaining Earn-Out Amounts shall be paid, at the election of
Investor, either by (i) wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the CAG Parties or (ii) if the Investor elected to
pay a portion of the Purchase Price in PIK Notes, the issuance to CFFIC of
10.75% Earnout Amount PIK Notes in the aggregate principal amount of such
Earn-Out Amounts.

(e) Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing until the earlier of (x)
December 21, 2008 and (y) the date on which the CAG Parties have received an
amount equal to the Earn-Out Cap (through payments pursuant to this Section
_2.7_ and/or through payments made by Investor under  _Section 2.7(h)),_
Investor shall not, and shall not permit any other Person to, without the
prior written consent of the CAG Parties, require or otherwise cause the LLCs
or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

 

(i) take any action intended to or that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the CAG Parties right to Earn-Out Amounts, the amount
thereof or the ability to calculate the amount thereof;

(ii) dispose of any of its assets or businesses (other than sales of assets
in the Ordinary Course of Business) that affect the amount of the Earn-Out
Amounts;



 

-30- (iii) postpone to any periods following December 21, 2008, any revenues or
profits that would otherwise be expected to occur prior to December 21, 2008;
or

(iv) accelerate to any periods prior to December 21, 2008, any costs of goods
sold or operating or other expenses that would otherwise be expected to occur
after December 21, 2008.

(f) In the event the Closing occurs following April 20, 2008 due to a delay by
Investor in completing the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing or due to a
delay in the satisfaction of a condition to Closing within Investors
control, for all purposes of this _Section 2.7_ , all references to December
21, 2008 in this _Section 2.7_ shall automatically be updated to reflect the
last date in the next succeeding monthly Fiscal Period (for example, in the
event of a ten day delay, the date would be updated to January 18, 2009). All
payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ shall be treated by all parties
for tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

(g) The dispute resolution provisions of _Sections 2.7(b)(ii)_ and _2.7(c)_
shall not apply to, and the scope of the Experts authority herein shall not
extend to, any dispute of the parties relating to the interpretation, breach
or enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement.

(h) Investor may at any time elect to pay to the CAG Parties by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Earn-Out Cap, less any
payments previously made under this _Section 2.7_ and upon such payment, all
of the obligations of the Investor under this _Section 2.7_ shall cease.

Section 2.8. _Tax Matters Relating to the PIK Notes and the Warrant_. The
Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and, where
applicable, state, local, and foreign Tax purposes): (i) the purchase and sale
of the Transferred LLC Interests constitutes a direct acquisition by Holdco
from the CAG Parties of all of the Transferred Assets; (ii) the Purchase Price
PIK Notes and the 10.75% Earnout Amount PIK Notes (if any) shall have an issue
price equal to their aggregate principal amounts when issued; (iii) the
Warrant shall have a fair market value at issuance of $250,000, which amount
shall be treated as a portion of the consideration paid for the Transferred
Assets (and, should the Warrant be later sold, repurchased or exercised, no
portion of the property then received for such Warrant shall be treated as
consideration for the Transferred Assets); and (iv) any cash paid, and the
principal amount of any 10.75% Earnout Amount PIK Notes issued, pursuant
to Section 2.7 shall be considered payments of additional consideration from
Holdco to the CAG Parties for the Transferred Assets. The Parties also agree
to file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and
information reports in a manner consistent with the foregoing.

Section 2.9. _Investor Right to Substitute Cash for PIK
Notes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Investor may elect
to pay (or cause the payment of ) cash in lieu of Purchase Price PIK Notes
otherwise issuable at Closing hereunder. If Investor exercises such option,
all covenants and conditions herein related to the delivery of the PIK Notes
at Closing shall be deemed to have been satisfied by the delivery of cash in
the amount equal to the principal amount of the corresponding series of PIK
Notes.



 

-31- Section 2.10. _Investor Right to Issue PIK Notes to CAG_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Investor may elect to issue PIK Notes,
including all or a portion of the Purchase Price PIK Notes, to CAG as partial
consideration for the purchase of the limited liability company interests of
Freebird rather than issuing all or a portion of such PIK Notes to CFFIC as
consideration for the purchase of the limited liability company interests of
Freebird II. Investor may make such election for any reason. In the event of
such election, the specific obligations of Investor with respect to delivery
of the PIK Notes, including pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)(i)_, as well as the
definition of CAG Cash Purchase Price, CFFIC Cash Purchase Price and other
provisions hereof, shall be deemed to be modified as appropriate to give
effect to such election.

breach or default, individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the operation of the CTG Business (as
conducted by the CTG Companies immediately prior to the date hereof and to
the Closing consistent with past practices). Neither the LLCs nor any of the
CTG Companies has received a written notice of default with respect to any
such Lease Agreement which has not been cured and to the knowledge of the CAG

been materially breached by any party thereto (other than CAG or its
Subsidiaries).

Section 6.5. _Orders_. There shall not be in effect any Order of any
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction enjoining the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions. There shall not be, at the time of Closing, any
pending suit, action or proceeding before any Governmental Body seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Closing in  



 

-52-  accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, which, considering the

existing earnings projections and the anticipated financial covenant levels
previously delivered to CAG, not give rise to a circumstance where it is
substantially less likely that the PIK Notes will be paid in accordance with
their scheduled maturities as a result of such final financial covenants.

(a) _Employees_.

(i) Each CTG US Business Employee who is or will be employed by the LLCs or a
CTG Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing (including those who are actively employed or on vacation, layoff,
leave or other permitted absence from employment other than short-term or
long-term disability leave) shall remain an employee of the LLCs or such CTG
Company or such Subsidiary immediately following the Closing (such CTG US
Business Employees, the " _Transferred US Employees_ "); _provided_ _that_
neither the LLCs nor their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue
employing such Transferred US Employees for any length of time thereafter
except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, any employment Contract
or a Collective Bargaining Agreement.

(ii) With respect to those CTG US Business Employees who are not actively at
work on the Closing Date because they are (A) on approved long-term disability
leave in accordance with the CAG Plans or (B) on approved short-term
disability leave in accordance with the CAG Plans but do not return to active
employment on or prior to the expiration of such short-term disability leave
(the " _Inactive US Employees_ "), from and after the Closing Date, CAG shall
continue to provide such Inactive US Employees with disability benefit
coverage under the CAG Plans to the extent consistent with the terms of the
CAG Plans; _provided_ _that_ , if any such Inactive US Employee returns to
active work at the conclusion of such leave (and with it being understood
that the LLCs and their Subsidiaries shall offer employment to each such
Inactive US Employee who becomes ready, willing and able to return to active
work within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date or as otherwise required
by applicable Legal Requirements), such Inactive US Employee shall become a "
_Transferred US Employee_ " for purposes hereunder as of the date of such
persons return to active employment with the LLCs or any of their
Subsidiaries (the " _Transfer Date_ ").

(iii) The transfer of those CTG Business Employees employed in
jurisdictions outside the United States shall be governed by the Legal
Requirements of the applicable jurisdictions.

(b) _Employee Benefits Liabilities: CAG and Trade Group Plans_. Effective as
of the Closing, CAG shall retain and satisfy any and all responsibility, and
Investor and the LLCs shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever,
for any and all claims, liabilities and obligations, whether contingent or
otherwise, except to the extent such liabilities, claims and obligations are
accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet, relating to the CAG Plans that are not
Trade Group Plans, whether arising on, prior to, or after the Closing Date.
Effective as of the Closing, the LLCs and their Subsidiaries shall assume,
retain and satisfy any and all responsibility, and CAG shall have no liability
or responsibility whatsoever, for any and all claims, liabilities
and obligations, whether contingent or otherwise, relating to the Trade Group
Plans, whether arising on, prior to, or after the Closing Date.

(c) _Employee Benefits; General_. As of the Closing Date, except as otherwise
provided in the Transition Services Agreement, the LLCs, the CTG Companies and
each of their respective Subsidiaries shall cease to be
participating employers under the CAG US Plans that  



 

-58-  are not Trade Group US Plans (" _Parent US Plans_ "). Except as set forth in
_Section 7.6(e)(i)_, as of the Closing Date (or Transfer Date, if
applicable), Transferred US Employees shall cease to accrue any further
benefits as active participants and shall have no rights to continue as active
participants under the Parent US Plans (without derogation of their rights as
vested, terminated participants). For Transferred US Employees, subject to
Legal Requirements, Investor will cause the LLCs and their Subsidiaries to
provide such Transferred US Employees (as a group), during the period
beginning immediately following the Closing Date (or Transfer Date, if
applicable) and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date or such
other time as may be required under a Collective Bargaining Agreement (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), with compensation and employee benefits (other than
(i) defined benefit pension benefits, (ii) retiree health, life and other
welfare benefits, and (iii) equity-based plans, programs and policies, except
as may be required by a Collective Bargaining Agreement) that are reasonably
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided
as of the date hereof under the CAG Plans (any such employee health and
welfare benefit plans of the LLCs or its Subsidiaries in which Transferred US
Employees become eligible to participate after the Closing Date shall be
referred hereinafter as " _LLC Welfare Plans_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, CAG shall amend all applicable CAG Plans that provide health
and welfare benefits to CTG Business Employees immediately prior to Closing
to provide that such CTG Business Employees shall continue participation in
such plans from the Closing Date through December 31, 2008 in accordance with
the Transition Services Agreement.

(d) _LLC Welfare Plans_. With respect to the LLC Welfare Plans, except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, Investor shall
cause the LLCs and their Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable best
efforts:

(i) with respect to each such plan that is a medical or health plan, to waive,
or cause the waiver of, any exclusions for pre-existing conditions and waiting
periods for each Transferred US Employee and his/her dependents to the extent
that such pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods were
previously satisfied under the comparable CAG Plan or Trade Group Plan for the
plan year that includes such transfer;

(ii) with respect to each such plan that is a medical or health plan, to
provide each Transferred US Employee with credit for any deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by such Transferred US Employee prior to
his or her transfer to the applicable LLC Welfare Plan (to the same extent
such credit was given under the comparable CAG Plan or Trade Group Plan)
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
such LLC Welfare Plan for the plan year that includes such transfer; and

(iii) to recognize service of the Transferred US Employees credited by CAG
solely for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in any LLC
Welfare Plan in which the Transferred US Employees are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date to the extent that such service was
recognized for that purpose under the comparable CAG Plan or Trade Group Plan
prior to such transfer; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Transferred US
Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. CAG will
make available to Investor employee participation data and year-to-date
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses as of the Closing Date.



 

-59- (e) _U.S. Retirement Benefits_.

(i) _Non-Union Defined Benefit Pension_. Effective as of the Closing Date,
each Transferred US Employee who is not subject to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement and who participates in the ConAgra Foods, Inc. Pension Plan for
Salaried Employees or the ConAgra Foods, Inc. Pension Plan for Hourly Rate
Production Employees (the " _CAG Non-Union Retirement Benefits_ ") will cease
to accrue benefits under the CAG Non-Union Retirement Benefits, provided that,
effective as of the Closing Date, CAG shall amend the CAG Non-Union Retirement
Benefits to provide that (A) any service of such non-union Transferred US
Employees with the LLCs, the CTG Companies or their respective Subsidiaries,
or their respective ERISA Affiliates from the Closing Date through December
31, 2012 and attained age through the earlier of (i) the date of termination
of such non-union Transferred US Employees employment following the Closing
Date or (ii) December 31, 2012 will be recognized solely for purposes of
determining eligibility for subsidized early retirement benefits (but not for
any other purpose) under the CAG Non-Union Retirement Benefits and (B) all
such non-union Transferred US Employees shall be fully vested in their accrued

soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date but prior to any
transfer of account balances to the CTG 401(k) Plan in accordance with this
_Section 7.6(e)(iv)_. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the

Companies or their respective Subsidiaries from the Closing Date through
December 31, 2008 will also be recognized for purposes of determining
eligibility for receipt of the Retiree Medical Benefit, it being understood
that CAG and its Affiliates may amend, modify or terminate any such benefit at
any time, in accordance with the terms of the CAG Plans and applicable Legal
Requirements, and provided that such Transferred US Employee begins to
receive early Retiree Medical Benefits and early retirement benefits under the
applicable CAG defined benefit pension plan at the same time and proves that
continuous coverage under a health plan provided by the LLCs, the
CTG Companies or their respective Subsidiaries existed from the Closing Date
through the effective date of such Transferred US Employees enrollment as a
participant in the early Retiree Medical Benefit.

will retain discretion to determine company performance for the applicable
Modified Period for each 2008 Incentive Plan against targets that are pro-

approved by CAG for each 2008 Incentive Plan is the "Pool" for such 2008
Incentive Plan); (E) a committee consisting of the individuals who are

purposes of determining the amount of any payment to be made under the 2008
Senior Executive Incentive Plan, the Contemplated Transactions constitute a
"Qualifying Divestiture"; (B) the Senior Executive Incentive Plan terms will
be revised in a manner that is reasonably intended to comply with Section
409A of the Code, to the extent Section 409A of the Code is applicable (but
CAG is not providing a warranty that such provisions will comply with Section
409A of the Code), and CAG may obtain an agreement or release from any
affected individual with respect to such compliance; and (C) Investor must

form or otherwise, engaged in a Restricted Business and shall be permitted
also to continue to operate (i) the Commerce City grain investment, (ii) the
Lamb Weston Watts Brothers fertilizer business, (iii) the activities
contemplated by the Dried Dairy Products Agreement and (iv) any activity
currently conducted by CAGs milling operations, all as currently conducted as
of the date hereof; _provided that_ CAG and its Subsidiaries shall be
permitted to perform risk management services and trading activities for their
own account and for the accounts of their Subsidiaries and affiliates and
shall be permitted to market and sell excess raw materials purchased or
generated in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ _further_ that,
subject to the Byproducts Services Agreement, CAG and its Subsidiaries shall
be permitted to merchandise and sell byproducts of their mill operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CAG and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to
acquire and operate a Restricted Business if such business is ancillary to a
larger acquired business and not more than 25% of the revenues of such
larger business are derived from the Restricted Business; _provided_ _that_ ,
if more than 25% of the revenues of such larger business are derived from the
Restricted Business and such Restricted Business is acquired during the
Noncompete Period, then the CAG Parties shall, promptly following the
acquisition and subject to the right of first offer in favor of Freebird in
_Section 7.15(b)_, begin steps to dispose of such Restricted Business and
diligently pursue such disposition until completed.

(b) In the event that the CAG Parties are required to dispose of any
Restricted Business pursuant to  _Section 7.15(a)_ during the Non-Compete
Period, they shall provide written notice to Freebird of such intended
disposition. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, Freebird
will notify the CAG Parties in writing whether it wishes to proceed with
negotiations with the CAG Parties regarding an acquisition of such Restricted
Business. If so, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree upon the
terms of such an acquisition for up to forty-five (45) days. If the parties
are unable to agree upon terms and conditions within such forty-five (45) day
period, the CAG Parties shall be free to dispose of the Restricted Business to
a third party.

(c) Each of the CAG Parties covenants and agrees that such Person shall not,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and affiliates not to, during the
Noncompete Period, for any reason or no reason, directly or indirectly, hire,
employ or otherwise engage any individual who is an employee of any of the
LLCs or their Subsidiaries or a contractor or consultant performing services
exclusively for the benefit of any of the LLCs or their Subsidiaries on a
routine and continuing basis or solicit him or her to leave his or her
employment with, or terminate or substantially modify his or her contractual
arrangement with, the LLCs or their Subsidiaries, or otherwise encourage or
entice any such employee or contractor to do so, without the written consent
of the senior human resources executive of Freebird. Each of the Investor and
Freebird covenants and agrees that none of it or and its respective
Subsidiaries shall, during the Noncompete Period for any reason or no reason,
directly or  



 

-70-  indirectly, hire, employ or otherwise engage any individual who was an
employee of any of the CAG Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
a contractor or consultant performing services for the benefit of any of the
CAG Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries on a routine and
continuing basis or solicit him or her to leave his or her employment with, or
terminate or substantially modify his or her contractual arrangement with,
any of the CAG Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise
encourage or entice any such employee or contractor to do so, without the
consent of the senior human resources executive of CAG.

(d) In the event of the breach or threatened breach of any portion of this
_Section 7.15_ , the parties agree that the remedy at law for such breach
shall be inadequate and that, in addition to and not to the exclusion of any
other rights and remedies at law or in equity, each Party shall be entitled to
temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief restraining any Person from any
activities that might result in or continue a breach of this _Section 7.15_ ,
and to a decree for specific performance of the provisions hereof, without
being required to show actual damage or irreparable harm or to furnish any
bond or other security. Further, the breaching Party shall not plead in
defense that there would be an adequate remedy at law, and the Party asserting
such breach shall be entitled to reimbursement from the breaching Party for
all costs, expenses and damages which it may have incurred as a result of the
breach of this _Section 7.15_. Such injunctive relief shall not be the
exclusive remedy of the Party asserting a breach of this _Section 7.15_ and,
notwithstanding the existence of such right to obtain injunctive relief, the
Party asserting such breach may pursue any and all other available legal and
equitable remedies in the event of a breach by a Party of any of the
restrictive covenants set forth in this _Section 7.15_. If any of the
provisions of this _Section 7.15_ , or any part thereof, is hereafter
construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the
remainder of the provisions of this Agreement, including the other provisions
of this _Section 7.15_ , which shall be given full effect, without regard to
the invalid or unenforceable portions. If any of the provisions of this
_Section 7.15_ , or any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of
the duration of such provision, the area covered thereby or the type of
conduct restricted therein, the parties agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to modify the duration, geographic area
and/or other terms of such provision and, as so modified, said provision
shall then be enforceable. In the event that the courts of any one or more
jurisdictions shall hold such provisions wholly or partially unenforceable by
reason of the scope thereof or otherwise, it is the intention of the
parties hereto that such determination not bar or in any way affect a Partys
right to the relief provided for herein in the courts of any other
jurisdictions as to breaches or threatened breaches of such provisions in such
other jurisdictions. 

Section 7.16. _Contribution of Foreign Buyer and Freebird to Freebird II_. On
the Closing date, immediately following the Closing, Investor shall
contribute, or shall cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, all of
the Equity Interests of the CTG Foreign Companies and Freebird to Freebird II.

Section 7.17. _Confidential Information_. All information about the CTG
Business whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether oral or
written, and regardless of the manner or form in which it is furnished or the
storage medium, is referred to in this Agreement as " _Confidential
Information_." Confidential Information does not include, however,
information which (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure by



 

-71-  the CAG Parties, their affiliates or their Representatives or (b) becomes
available to the CAG Parties after the Closing Date on a nonconfidential
basis from a Person other than the LLCs who is not otherwise bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the LLCs, or is not otherwise under an
obligation to the LLCs not to transmit the information to the CAG Parties.
Except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations, each CAG
Party agrees to keep all Confidential Information confidential and not to
disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any Person or use any
Confidential Information. In the event that the CAG Parties are required by
applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any other
Confidential Information or any other information concerning the CTG Business,
the CAG Parties agree that they will provide Freebird with prompt written
notice of such requirement in order to enable Freebird to seek an appropriate
protective order or other remedy. The CAG Parties will reasonably assist
Freebird in connection with any attempt it may make to obtain such order or
other remedy. If Freebird fails to obtain such a protective order or other
remedy, the CAG Parties shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information which the CAG Parties are advised in writing by counsel that it is
legally required, and the CAG Parties shall exercise their reasonable best
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything above to the
contrary in this _Section 7.17_, each Person otherwise subject hereto may
disclose any and all information related to the U.S. federal, state, local or
foreign Tax treatment or Tax structure of any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

Section 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing solely as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of CAG and Investor;

(b) ninety (90) days after the date of the signing of this Agreement (the "
_End Date_ "), by CAG or Investor by notice to the other (if none of such
terminating Party is then in material breach of this Agreement which breach
has caused the Closing not to occur prior to such date), if the Closing has
not occurred on or before the date such notice is given;

(c) by CAG by notice to Investor if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment on or before the End
Date, and shall not have been waived by CAG (unless the failure of any such
condition to have been fulfilled results primarily from CAG breaching any
representation or covenant contained in this Agreement); or

(d) by Investor by notice to CAG if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article V_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment on or before the End
Date, and shall not have been waived by Investor (unless the failure of any
such condition to have been fulfilled results primarily from Investor
breaching any representation or covenant contained in this Agreement).

Section 8.2.  _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , all further obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate and this agreement shall become null and void and of
no further force and effect, except for the obligations set forth in _Section
10.5_ , this _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_ , and except that
such termination shall not relieve any Party of any Liability for any
intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud prior to such termination.



 

-72- Section 8.3. _Termination Fees_.

(a) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by CAG or Investor pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_, Holdco has not yet received the Equity Financing that is the subject
of the condition set forth in _Section 5.10,_ and all other conditions to
Closing for the Parties hereunder have been satisfied or are capable of being
satisfied (or waived in the case of the CAG Parties), other than any
conditions that have not been satisfied or are not capable of being satisfied
(or waived in the case of the CAG Parties) because of a breach by Investor of
its obligations hereunder or any failure of Holdco to receive the Equity
Financing; _or_

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Investor pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_,
and the condition in _Article V_ that shall have become incapable of
fulfillment on or before the End Date is the condition in  _Section 5.10_
that Holdco shall have received the Equity Financing, and all other conditions
to Closing for the Parties hereunder have been satisfied or are capable of
being satisfied (or waived in the case of the CAG Parties), other than any
conditions that have not been satisfied or are not capable of being satisfied
(or waived in the case of the CAG Parties) because of a breach by Investor of
its obligations hereunder or any failure of Holdco to receive the Equity
Financing);  _or_

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by CAG or Investor pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_, the Investor has breached its obligation under this Agreement and
all conditions to Closing for the Parties hereunder have been satisfied or are
capable of being satisfied (or waived in the case of the CAG Parties), other
than any conditions that have not been satisfied or are not capable of being
satisfied (or waived in the case of the CAG Parties) because of a breach by
Investor of its obligations hereunder or any failure of the LLCs to receive
the Equity Financing;

then Holdco shall pay to CAG, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by CAG, a termination fee in the amount
of $27,500,000 as liquidated damages (the " _Equity Termination Fee_ "). The
Equity Termination Fee shall be paid by Holdco to CAG no later than three (3)
Business Days after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_, as the case may be. Holdco shall have no
obligation to pay the Equity Termination Fee more than once under this
_Section 8.3(a)_.

(b) In the event that:

(i)(A) this Agreement is terminated by CAG or Investor pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_, the LLCs have not yet received the Debt Financing that is the subject
of the condition set forth in _Section 5.9_ , one or more of the Lenders has
breached its obligations to Holdco under any of the written commitments for
the Debt Financing described in _Section 4.6,_ and all other conditions to
Closing for  



 

-73-  the Parties hereunder have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied
(or waived in the case of the CAG Parties), other than any conditions that
have not been satisfied or are not capable of being satisfied (or waived in
the case of the CAG Parties) because of a breach by Investor of its
obligations hereunder or the failure of the LLCs to receive any Debt Financing
or the Equity Financing;  _or_ (B) this Agreement is terminated by Investor
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, the condition in _Article V_ that shall have
become incapable of fulfillment on or before the End Date is the condition
in  _Section 5.9_ that the LLCs shall have received the Debt Financing, and
one or more of the Lenders has breached its obligations to Holdco under any of
the written commitments for the Debt Financing described in _Section 4.6_,
and all other conditions to Closing for the Parties hereunder have been
satisfied or are capable of being satisfied (or waived in the case of the CAG
Parties), other than any conditions that have not been satisfied or are not
capable of being satisfied because of a breach by Investor of its obligations
hereunder or any failure of the LLCs to receive the Debt Financing or the
Equity Financing); _and_

(ii) there is a reasonable prospect of receipt of a material recovery from
such breaching Lender(s) if Holdco were to bring an action against and/or to
enter into settlement negotiations with such Lender(s) (any such action or
negotiation, a " _Lender Action_ ");

then: Holdco shall pay to CAG a termination fee (the " _Debt Termination Fee_
") in the amount of up to $27,500,000 as liquidated damages; provided that (x)
Holdco shall bring and thereafter continue to pursue a Lender Action only if
the CAG Parties pay 50% of the ongoing prosecution costs and other costs
and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by Holdco in connection with any Lender Action (including costs
incurred in defending any counterclaim), and (y) the sole source for the
payment of the Debt Termination Fee shall be 50% of any amounts actually
collected from such breaching Lender(s) in such Lender Action. If there is not
a reasonable prospect of receipt of a material recovery from any Lender
Action, Holdco shall have no obligation to bring a Lender Action, and no Debt
Termination Fee or other amount will be payable to the CAG Parties pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
payment of the Equity Termination Fee by Holdco when such Equity Termination
Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with _Section 8.3(a)_,  _or_
the payment of the Debt Termination Fee by Holdco when such Debt Termination
Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_, as the
case may be, shall each be considered liquidated damages and shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of CAG and its Affiliates for all purposes
under this Agreement, and (ii) under no circumstances shall CAG or its
Affiliates seek, or be entitled to seek, any other remedy under applicable Law
(including equitable relief or specific performance) except in connection
with the enforcement of any rights under _Section 8.3(b)_ to require a Lender
Action and related matters.

(except under _Sections 9.2(c)_ , _9.2(d)_ , _9.2(e)_ , _9.2(f)_ and _9.2(i)_
) until the total of all Losses with  



 

-76-  respect to such matters exceeds fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) (the "
_Deductible_ ") and then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed
the Deductible. CAG shall have no liability with respect to claims under
_Section 9.2(i)_ until the total Losses attributed to the Environmental
Liability exceeds the sum of (i) the established reserve on the Final Balance
Sheet and (ii) $500,000 (such sum, the " _Schedule 3.15 Deductible_ ") and
then only for the amount by which the Losses attributed to the Environmental

dollars ($600,000,000); provided, however, this limitation shall not apply to
CAGs indemnification obligations under _Sections 9.2(c)_ , _9.2(d)_ ,
_9.2(e)_ ,  _9.2(f)_ , _9.2(g)_ , _9.2(h)_ and _9.2(i)_ or for a breach of

_3.4(a) (Company Interests)_ , _3.4(b) (Title)_ or _3.14 (Brokers or
Finders)_. Neither Investor nor the LLCs shall have any liability with respect
to claims under _Section 9.3_ (except under _Sections 9.3(c)_ , _9.3(d)_ ,
and  _9.3(e)_ until the total of all Losses with respect to such matters
exceeds the Deductible, and then only for the amount by which such Losses
exceed the Deductible. In no event shall the aggregate liability of Investor
and the LLCs under Section 9.3 exceed six hundred million dollars
($600,000,000); provided, however, this limitation shall not apply to
Investors indemnification obligation for a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in _Sections 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing)_ ,
_4.2 (Enforceability; Authority; No Conflict)_ , and _4.5 (Brokers or
Finders)_ and the covenants in _Section 7.14 (Financing)_ or for Investors
indemnification obligations under  _Sections 9.3(c)_ and _9.3(d)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Person

in excess of the amounts so included as liabilities (including any reserve)
in the Final Balance Sheet shall be subject to indemnification hereunder in
accordance with and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this
_Article IX_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Losses shall
be net of any insurance, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually received by an Indemnified Person in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification. The Indemnified Person shall seek full
recovery under all insurance policies and indemnification provisions covering
any Losses to the same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Subject to _Section 7.12_ , in the event that an
insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Person with respect to
any Losses for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a
refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery less the out-of-pocket
costs to obtain such recovery shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying
Person.



 

-77- (e) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL AN
INDEMNIFYING PERSON BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXEMPLARY (TO THE EXTENT NOT PAYABLE TO
THIRD PARTIES), PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, MULTIPLE OF
PROFITS, REMOTE, OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES; _provided_ , _however_ , that if an
Indemnified Person is held liable to a third party for any such Losses and
the applicable Indemnifying Person is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified
Person for the matter that gave rise to such Losses, then such Indemnifying
Person shall be liable for, and obligated to reimburse such Indemnified
Person for such Losses.

(f) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or any of the Related
Agreements shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time,
or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will not
affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

(g) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or CTG
Material Adverse Effect or Investor Material Adverse Effect qualifications
in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be
disregarded.

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, CAG shall have no
liability with respect to claims under _Section 9.2(d), (e), or (f)_ with
respect to Taxes attributable to actions taken by the CTG Companies (other
than those in the ordinary course of the CTG Companies trade or business,
activities, or operations) after the Closing but on the Closing Date.

(i) CAG shall have no liability with respect to any claim under _Section
9.2(h)_ with respect to any Losses attributed to Environmental Liability for
the conduct of any environmental investigation, monitoring, clean-up,
containment, restoration, removal or other corrective or response action
at or upon the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property (each a "Response
Action") unless such Response Action is conducted in a cost effective manner,
to attain compliance with minimum remedial standards established under
applicable Environmental Law, employing where applicable risk-based remedial
standards and institutional controls. CAG may either, at CAGs option, perform
or cause to be performed the Response Action (along with all related
negotiations and settlements with Governmental Bodies and third parties), or
shall authorize the Investor or the LLCs to perform such Response Action (in
which case CAG shall have the right to approve material decisions with respect
to such Response Action, such approval not unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). In the event CAG performs the Response Action, the Investor and
the LLCs shall provide CAG and its agents with reasonable access to the
relevant property or facility and shall reasonably cooperate with CAG in
connection therewith, provided that CAG shall undertake diligent efforts to
prevent unreasonable interference with operations upon the relevant Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property. Regardless of which party performs the
Response Action, the non-performing party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, at its sole cost and expense, to reasonably participate in the
Response Action, which participation shall include, without limitation: (i)
the right to receive  



 

-78-  copies of material documents submitted to, and received from, Governmental
Bodies or third parties; (ii) notice of, and the opportunity to attend
and participate in, material meetings and conference calls with Governmental
Bodies or third parties; and (iii) the right to reasonably consult with the
performing party. CAG shall have no obligation to indemnify the Investor or
the LLCs with respect to Losses attributed to Environmental Liability for the
conduct of any Response Action arising from "voluntary action" by or on behalf
of the Investor or the LLCs. For purposes of this _Section 9.4(i)_ "voluntary
action" shall mean inspections or testing undertaken by or on behalf of the
Investor or the LLCs that do not fall into one or more of the following
categories (a)-(c): (a) required by applicable Environmental Law or the terms
of a lease agreement then in effect, (b) undertaken in reasonable response to
an unsolicited third party claim or demand or (c) undertaken in reasonable
response to material facts indicating a potentially significant threat to
human health or the environment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no
circumstances shall "voluntary action" include either of the following: (i)
the discovery of On-Site Contamination in the course of or in connection with
production, maintenance, repair and inspection activities conducted in the
normal course of the operation of the CTG Business, including environmental
surveillance activities conducted pursuant to industry standard environmental
management systems, consistent with standard industry practices; and (ii)
actions taken in the ordinary course of facility expansion or construction
projects.

(j) CAGs indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 9.2(h)_ shall
survive the Closing and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions for a
period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date.

(k) CAGs indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 9.2(g)_ and
_Section 9.2(i)_ shall survive the Closing and consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions without expiration or termination.

Section 9.5. _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly (and in any event within 30 days) after receipt by a Person
entitled to indemnity under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ of notice of the
assertion of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person shall
give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (each, an
" _Indemnifying Person_ ") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim; 
_provided that_ the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve
the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified
Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that
the defense of such Third-Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced
by the Indemnified Persons failure to give such notice.

(b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant
to _Section 9.5(a)_ of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (x) the Indemnifying Person
is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the
Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, (y) greater than 50% of the Losses are reasonably anticipated
to be incurred by the Indemnified Person because such Losses exceed the
applicable maximum limit (if any) for indemnification contained in _Section
9.4_ , or (z) material equitable or other non-monetary relief is  



 

-79-  sought from any Indemnified Person pursuant to such Third-Party Claim) to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. After notice from the
Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long
as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person
under this _Article IX_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses
with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense
of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If
the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such
assumption will, unless additional information at the time of the assumption
emerges to change this conclusion, conclusively establish for purposes of
this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the
scope of and subject to indemnification (but no such assumption shall affect
the applicability of any limit on indemnification contained in _Section 9.4_
), and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be
effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Persons consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any material violation of
Legal Requirement and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnified Person shall have
no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party
Claims effected without its consent if required pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the
assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not,
within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Persons notice is given, give
notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination
made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the
Indemnified Person.

(c) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this _Article IX_ : (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person reasonably informed of
the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all
stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and
(ii) the Parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in
good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third-Party Claim.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 9.5_ shall not govern any Tax Claims, and
the procedures set out in _Section 9.7_ shall govern for all Tax Claims
(except as set forth in _Section 9.7(b)_).

Section 9.6. _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification to the extent not
resulting from a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party
from whom indemnification is sought and, unless disputed within 90 days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such notice, shall be paid promptly
after such notice.

Section 9.7. _Tax Provisions_.

(a) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to an Indemnified Person pursuant to
_Section 9.2_, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to
the Indemnifying Person in writing of  



 

-80-  such claim and of any counterclaim the Indemnified Person proposes to assert
(a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Person has been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

(b)(i) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
(ii) with respect to any other Tax Claim not included in clause (i) for which
CAG is the Indemnifying Person (and for these purposes has, subject to any
conditions, agreed to assume the defense of such Tax Claim (and such
assumption will, unless additional information at the time of the assumption
emerges to change this conclusion, conclusively establish for purposes of
this Agreement that the claims made in that Tax Claim are within the scope of
and subject to indemnification)), CAG shall, solely at its own cost and
expense, control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without
limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such
refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner;  _provided_
_that_ , with respect to Tax Claims described above, (x) CAG must regularly
consult with, and accept the reasonable comments of, Investor relating to such
Tax Claim and (y) CAG may not settle such Tax Claim without the consent of
Investor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, other than, with
respect to both (x) and (y), any Tax Claim, any issue arising from any Tax
Claim or any settlement of a Tax Claim where the Tax Claim, issue, or
settlement does not, and would not be reasonably expected to, materially
impact the Taxes, Tax refunds, claims or assessments, or Tax accounting or
reporting of the CTG Business, the CTG Companies, the LLCs or Investor, in
each case solely for a taxable period that begins on or after the Closing
Date or for the portion of a Straddle Period that begins on or after the
Closing Date.

(c) Freebird shall control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to Taxes of the CTG Companies for any Straddle Period or taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date (other than Tax Claims to which
_Section 9.7(b)(ii)_ is applicable), but, with respect to any Tax Claim that
relates in whole or in part to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
prior to the Closing Date (as determined pursuant to _Section 9.9_ ), (i)
Freebird must regularly consult with, and accept the reasonable comments of,
CAG relating to such Tax Claim and (ii) Freebird may not settle such Tax Claim
without the consent of CAG, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
other than, with respect to both (i) and (ii), any Tax Claim, any issue
arising from any Tax Claim or any settlement of a Tax Claim where the Tax
Claim, issue, or settlement does not affect the liability of the CAG Parties
under _Section 9.2_.

(d) This _Section 9.7_, and not _Section 9.5_, shall govern the procedures
for any Tax Claim.

Section 9.8. _Indemnification Payments_. With respect to any Losses due and
payable under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ by any Indemnifying Person,
such Indemnifying Person shall satisfy its payment obligations by paying the
full amount of such Losses directly to the applicable Indemnified Person.



 

-81- Section 9.9. _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For purposes of _Section 9.2(d)_ ,
any Taxes of the CTG Companies for a Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of the period beginning on the first day after the Closing Date. With respect
to any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by
income or receipts of the CTG Companies allocated to the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of
the CTG Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through
entity including the CTG Companies and any entity in which the CTG Companies
hold a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time); 
_provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, and not on a closing of the books method, (including, but not
limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period
beginning on the first day after the Closing Date based on the number of days
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date, on the one hand, and the number of days for the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning on the first day after the Closing Date, on the other hand.
The amount of other Taxes of the CTG Companies for a Straddle Period allocated
to the period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. Notwithstanding this _Section 9.9_, any Taxes attributable to the
period on the Closing Date after the Closing that do not arise in the ordinary
course of the CTG Companies\' trade or business, activities, or
operations shall be allocated to the portion of the period beginning on the
first day after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE X.

practicable.



 

-82- Section 10.3. _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Filing and Payment Responsibilities_.

(i) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any CTG Company, CAG shall prepare or
cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed (in a manner consistent
with past practices) with the appropriate taxing authorities all Tax Returns
required to be filed, and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns to the extent such returns relate to the CTG Companies; _provided
that_ CAG shall permit the LLCs to review and comment upon such Tax Returns,
to the extent such Tax Returns relate to any CTG Company, prior to the filing
thereof, such comments to be considered in good faith by CAG.

(ii) Investor shall cause the LLCs or the CTG Companies, as applicable, to
prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file or cause to be filed when due all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the CTG
Companies for taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date and
shall cause the LLCs or the CTG Companies, as applicable, to remit any Taxes
due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(iii) For any Straddle Period of the CTG Companies, Investor shall cause the
LLCs or the CTG Companies, as applicable, to timely prepare or cause to be
prepared, any Straddle Period Tax Returns of the CTG Companies; provided that
Investor shall permit CAG to review and comment upon such Tax Returns, prior
to the filing thereof, such comments to be considered in good faith
by Investor. Notwithstanding the above, CAG shall timely prepare or cause to
be prepared any Straddle Period Tax Returns of the CTG Companies listed on
_Schedule 10.3(a)(iii)_ ; provided that CAG shall permit Investor to review
and comment upon such Tax Returns, prior to the filing thereof, such comments
to be considered in good faith by CAG. With respect to any Tax Returns
prepared pursuant to this _Section 10.3(a)(iii)_, Investor shall cause the
LLCs or the CTG Companies, as applicable, to file or cause to be filed, all
such Tax Returns required to be filed and pay all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns; provided that, CAG shall reimburse the LLCs (in accordance
with the procedures set forth in _Sections 9.2_ and _9.8_ ) for any amount
owed by CAG pursuant to _Section 9.2_ with respect to the taxable periods
covered by such Tax Returns.

(iv) For all tax periods of the LLCs that end on or before the Closing Date,
CAG shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed when
due (in a manner consistent with past practices) all Tax Returns required to
be filed, and shall remit any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

(b) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The CTG Companies, CAG, the
LLCs and Investor shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any  



 

-83-  other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon such other Partys request) the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, Tax
Claim, or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The CTG Companies, CAG, the LLCs and Investor
agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the CTG Business relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by CTG Companies, CAG, the LLCs or Investor, as applicable,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
(ii) to give each other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if such other
Party so requests, the CTG Companies or CAG, as the case may be, shall allow
such other Party to take possession of such books and records. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 10.3(b)_, CAG will only be required to deliver to
the LLCs the portions of such books and records that relate to the CTG
Business or CTG Companies and may redact any statements or other information
on the portions of such books and records that do not relate to the CTG
Business or CTG Companies. In addition to the foregoing, (i) CAG also shall
cooperate fully with Investor, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
Investor, in connection with Investors filing of its Tax Returns and any
audits, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Investor and its
Taxes, and (ii) the LLCs also shall cooperate fully with CAG, as and to the
extent reasonable requested by CAG, in connection with CAGs filing of the
LLCs Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(iv)_ and any audits,
litigation, or other Proceeding with respect to any Taxes shown on such Tax
Returns.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, CAG shall have sole responsibility for all Transfer Taxes incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the Reorganization). CAG and Investor shall,
and Investor and CAG shall cause the LLCs to, cooperate in timely making all
filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the
provisions of such Tax Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Transfer
Taxes_ " shall mean all transfer, sales, excise, value added, stamp duty,
stamp duty reserve tax, documentary, registration and other such taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer taxes).

 

(d) _Section 754 Election, Allocation and Income Tax Treatment_.

(i) CAG will use its reasonable best efforts to cause Kalama Export Company
LLC to make a timely election under Section 754 of the Code effective as of
the Closing Date.

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than
ninety (90) days thereafter, CAG shall prepare and deliver (with assistance
as requested from the LLC) to Investor, an allocation schedule allocating all
such amounts as provided herein (the _"Proposed Allocation Schedule_ "); 
_provided_ _that_ , as set forth in _Section 2.3_, the Parties agree to
allocate the aggregate Purchase Price in the following manner: (i) each CTG
Foreign Company shall be allocated an amount of Purchase Price equal to
its net book value as shown on the Closing  



 

-84-  Balance Sheet, and (ii) the remainder of the Purchase Price shall be
allocated to the Transferred Assets. In preparing the Proposed Allocation
Schedule, CAG shall be entitled to reasonable access to all relevant books,
records and personnel of the CTG Companies and its Representatives to the
extent CAG reasonably requests such information and reasonable access to
complete its preparation of the Proposed Allocation Schedule. Investor will
have twenty (20) Business Days following delivery of the Proposed Allocation
Schedule during which to notify CAG in writing (an _"Allocation Notice of
Objection_ ") of any objections to the Proposed Allocation Schedule, setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis of its objections. In reviewing the
Proposed Allocation Schedule, Investor shall be entitled to reasonable access
to all relevant books, records and personnel of the CTG Companies and its
Representatives to the extent Investor reasonably requests such information
and reasonable access to complete its review of the Proposed Allocation
Schedule. If Investor fails to deliver an Allocation Notice of Objection
in accordance with this _Section 10.3(d)(ii)_, the Proposed Allocation
Schedule shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties and shall become the
_"Final Allocation Schedule_ ". If Investor submits an Allocation Notice
of Objection, then (A) for twenty (20) Business Days after the date CAG
receives the Allocation Notice of Objection, Investor and CAG will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the allocations and (B) failing
such agreement within twenty (20) Business Days of such notice, the matter
will be resolved in accordance with _Section 10.3(d)(iii)_.

(iii) Any amounts remaining in dispute at the conclusion of such twenty (20)
Business Day period that were properly included in the Allocation Notice of
Objection (the _"Unresolved Allocation Changes_ ") shall be submitted to the
Expert (as determined through the procedures set forth in _Section 2.6(c)_ ).
CAG and Investor agree to execute, if requested by the Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter. Investor and CAG will each deliver to the other and to the
Expert a notice setting forth in reasonable detail their proposed allocations.
The Expert shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based on the provisions of
this _Section 10.3_ and the definitions referred to herein, only the
Unresolved Allocation Changes. The Expert shall be instructed to determine its
best estimate of the allocation schedule based on its determination of the
Unresolved Allocation Changes and provide a written description of the basis
for its determination of the allocations therein within forty-five (45)
Business Days after the matter has been submitted to the Expert, which written
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. Each of the parties
shall furnish, at its own expense, the Expert and the other Party with such
documents and other written information as the Expert may request. Each Party
may also furnish to the Expert such other written information and documents as
such Party deems relevant; _provided_ , _that_ copies of all such documents
and materials shall be concurrently delivered to the other Party in the same
manner as such materials are delivered to the Expert. The Expert may, at its
discretion, conduct one or more conferences with respect to the dispute
between the parties, at which conference each Party shall have the right to
present such additional documents, materials and other information and to be
accompanied or represented by such Representatives as each Party shall choose
in its sole  



 

-85-  discretion. The fees and expenses of the Expert shall be apportioned among
Investor and CAG as the Expert shall determine. Each Party will bear the costs
of its own counsel, witnesses (if any) and employees.

(iv) The Parties agree to treat the following amounts as adjustments to the
price paid by Investor to the CAG Parties for the Transferred Assets: (i) any
amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.6(d), (ii) any cash paid, and the principal
amount of any 10.75% Earnout Amount PIK Notes issued, pursuant to  _Section
2.7_, and (iii) any indemnity payment made pursuant to _Section 9.2_.

(v) The Parties agree to act in accordance with the Final Allocation Schedule
for all Tax purposes (including for purposes of the filing of any Tax Return).
The Parties will revise the Final Allocation Schedule to the extent necessary
to reflect any payment made pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_, _Section 2.7_ or
_Section 9.2_. In the case of any such payment, CAG shall prepare and deliver
(with assistance as requested from the LLCs) to Investor a revised Final
Allocation Schedule, and the parties hereto shall follow the procedures
outlined above with respect to review, dispute and resolution in respect of
such revision.

(vi) The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and, where
applicable, state, local, and foreign Tax purposes) the purchase and sale of
the Transferred LLC Interests constitutes direct acquisition by Holdco from
the CAG Parties of all of the Transferred Assets.

(vii) The dispute resolution provisions of this  _Section 10.3(d)_ shall not
apply to, and the scope of the Expert\'s authority herein shall not extend to,
any dispute of the parties relating to the interpretation, breach or
enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement, except as may be necessary
to resolve the Unresolved Allocation Changes.

(e) _Refunds, Carrybacks and Tax Benefits_.

(i) CAG shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes of the CTG
Companies attributable to or arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a portion
of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (as determined pursuant to
_Section 9.9_) to the extent such refunds or credits exceed the amounts of
such refunds or credits for Taxes accrued on the face of the Closing
Balance Sheet. CAG shall not be entitled to refunds or credits that are the
result of losses or events occurring after the Closing Date.

(ii) The LLCs, or any Subsidiary of the LLCs, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes for which CAG is not entitled
pursuant _Section 10.3(e)(i)_.

(iii) If any final adjustment shall be made to any Tax Return for any CTG
Company relating, in whole or in party, to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and if such
adjustment results in a Tax Benefit to such CTG Company for any Tax period
that begins  



 

-86-  after the Closing Date or to a portion of a Straddle Period beginning on the
first day after the Closing Date, then Freebird or Freebird II, as
applicable, shall pay to CAG or CFFIC, as applicable, an amount equal to the
Tax Benefit obtained by such CTG Company. For the avoidance of doubt, no such
payment is ever required if the Tax Benefit is included as an asset on the
Closing Balance Sheet, and no such payment shall be due until the Tax Benefit
is actually realized or received by such CTG Company.

(iv) The LLCs shall forward (or cause their Subsidiaries to forward) to CAG
or reimburse CAG for any refunds or credits due CAG pursuant to _Section
10.3(e)(i)_ promptly (and in any event within 15 days) after receipt thereof,
and CAG shall forward to the LLCs or reimburse the LLCs pursuant to _Section
10.3(e)(ii)_ promptly (and in any event within 15 days) after receipt thereof.
In the case of a Tax Benefit payable to CAG or CFFIC, as applicable, pursuant
to  _Section 10.3(e)(iii)_, Freebird or Freebird II, as applicable, shall
pay the amount of such Tax Benefit to CAG or CFFIC, as applicable, promptly
(and in any event within 15 days) after the date on which the Tax Benefit is
actually realized or received by the CTG Company.

(f) _United States Federal Income Tax Classification_. Pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-3, the LLCs will be disregarded entities or
partnerships for U.S. federal and, if applicable, state and local income tax
purposes. In addition, certain domestic Subsidiaries of the LLCs listed on
_Schedule 10.3(f)_ are eligible entities with one or more members which will
be classified as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and, if applicable,
state and local income tax purposes. Without the prior written consent of CAG
and the Investor, (a) the LLCs shall not elect or authorize any Person to
elect to treat the LLCs or any such Subsidiary listed on _Schedule 10.3(f)_ as
anything other than a disregarded entity for U.S. federal and, if applicable,
state and local income tax purposes, and (b) the LLCs shall take such actions
as may be reasonably necessary to operate its domestic businesses through
entities which will be classified as disregarded entities or partnerships for
U.S. federal and, if applicable, state and local income tax purposes, except
as otherwise may be required by law. It is the intent of the Parties that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transfer of the Transferred Assets
constitutes an absolute sale, transfer and conveyance from the CAG Parties to
Investor of all right, title and interest in the Transferred Assets.

(g) _Section 338(g) Election_.

(i) Foreign Buyer or its designee shall have the right to file (or cause to be
filed) a timely election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any
corresponding election under U.S. state or local law) with respect to the
purchase and sale of the stock of the CTG Foreign Companies and any of their
Subsidiaries hereunder (collectively, a _"Section 338(g) Election_
"). Foreign Buyer or its designee shall inform the CAG Parties in writing of
any such Section 338(g) Election on or before the date such Section 338(g)
Election is filed.

(ii) Investor agrees to cause Foreign Buyer to pay (or cause to be paid) to
CAG, in cash, the amount of additional consideration necessary to cause the
 



 

-87-  CAG Parties\' after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the stock of the CTG
Foreign Companies with any Section 338(g) Election to be equal to the after-
Tax net proceeds that the CTG Parties would have received had any Section
338(g) Election not been made, taking into account all appropriate U.S.
federal, state, and local Tax implications (the " _Section 338 Adjustmen_
t"). 

(iii) Any Section 338 Adjustment shall be paid to CAG prior to or at the time
the Foreign Buyer files IRS Form 8023 to make any U.S. federal Section 338(g)
Election. The CAG Parties shall provide the Foreign Buyer with a schedule
computing the amount of any Section 338 Adjustment within 30 days after the
Parties have agreed to the Final Allocation Schedule; _provided_ _that_ that
CAG Parties shall permit the Foreign Buyer to review and comment on such
schedule, such comments to be considered in good faith by the CAG Parties. In
making such calculation, the highest corporate U.S. federal, state, and local
tax rates to which the CAG Parties are subject for this type of income shall
be used, and any other items of income, deduction, gain, loss, or credits of
the CAG Parties shall be ignored.

Section 10.4. _Notices_. All notices, Consents, waivers and other
communications required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in

appropriate address by hand or by nationally recognized overnight courier
service (costs prepaid), (b) sent by facsimile or e-mail with confirmation of

SUBSIDIARIES) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO (A) THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SCHEDULES, AND ANY CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT REQUIRED TO BE DELIVERED
HEREBY OR (B) THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each Party (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of

and the other Parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the other agreement contemplated hereby, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.5_.

Section 10.6. _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. The rights and remedies of the
Parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any
failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement
will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single
or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any
other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of
the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in
whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in
writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party
will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and
(c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of that Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements (including that certain letter agreement, dated as of
January 29, 2008 by and among CAG and Ospraie Advisors, L.P.), whether written
or oral, between the Parties with respect to its subject matter (including any
letter of intent between the Parties related to the subject matter of
this Agreement) and constitutes (along with the Schedules, Exhibits and other
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms of the agreement between the Parties with respect to
its subject matter;  _provided_ _that_ this _Section 10.7_ shall not apply to
any confidentiality agreement between the Parties related to the subject
matter of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented,
or otherwise modified except by a written agreement executed by all Parties.

Section 10.8. _Assignments, Successors and no Third-Party Rights_. No Party
may, in whole or in part, assign any of its rights or interests or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of both Investor and CAG, and any attempt to do so will be void;
_provided_ _that_ without prior written consent, either Holdco or CAG may
assign any of its or its Subsidiaries\' rights or interests or delegate any of
its obligations under this Agreement to any Subsidiary or other affiliate so
long as the assigning or delegating Party retains



 

-90-  its obligations under this Agreement and _provided further_ that Holdco may
assign any of its or its Subsidiaries rights hereunder to the Lenders as
collateral securing its obligations under the Debt Financing (or any
replacement or refinancing thereof). Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the
benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement, except such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted
assignee pursuant to this _Section 10.8_.

Section 10.9. _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is held illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or
future Legal Requirement, and if the rights or obligations of any Party
hereto under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected
thereby, (a) such provision (or part thereof) will be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision (or part thereof) had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision (or part thereof) or by its severance herefrom.

Section 10.10. _Headings_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All references to "Articles," "Sections" and
"Schedules" refer to the corresponding Articles, Sections and Schedules of
this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

Section 10.11. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

Section 10.12. _Execution of Agreemen_ t. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy
of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile transmission or by other
electronic transmission of a manual signature (by portable data format (PDF)
or other method that enables the recipient to reproduce a copy of the manual
signature) shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement
for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile or other
electronic transmission shall be deemed to be their original signatures for
all purposes.

Section 10.13. _Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.3(c)_ and without intending to limit the remedies available to
the Parties hereunder, each Party acknowledges that a breach of, conflict
with, or failure to perform or comply with, any of the covenants contained in
this Agreement may result in material irreparable injury to the other Party
or its Affiliates for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will
not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in
the event of such a breach or threat thereof, to the fullest extent permitted
by any Legal Requirement, each Party shall be entitled to seek a temporary
restraining order and/or a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
activities prohibited hereby or such other relief as may be required to
specifically enforce any of the covenants contained herein, and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, such Party agrees not



 

-91-  to oppose the granting of such injunctive relief on the basis that monetary
damages are an adequate remedy. Each Party hereby agrees and consents that
such injunctive relief may be sought in the courts in the State of New York,
or in any other court having competent jurisdiction.

Section 10.14. _Netting and Set-Off on the Closing Date_. With respect to
payments due on the Closing Date with respect to Closing only, each of the
Parties may net and set off any payment due from it to another Person

and in the same currency from such Person.

Section 10.15.  _Incorporation of Schedules_. All Schedules annexed hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement
as if set forth in full herein.

Section 10.16. _NO RECOURSE_. THE CAG PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE, ON BEHALF
OF THEMSELVES AND EACH OF THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES,
SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER AFFILIATES, THAT NEITHER HOLDCO NOR INVESTOR HAS ANY
ASSETS OTHER THAN HOLDCOS RIGHTS UNDER THE WRITTEN COMMITMENTS FOR THE DEBT
FINANCING AND THE EQUITY FINANCING DESCRIBED IN _SECTION 4.6_ , AND,

OTHER THAN HOLDCO AND INVESTOR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE
RELATED AGREEMENTS, THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THE RELATED AGREEMENTS.

---|--- 
Freebird Intermediate Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
" _Company_ ", which includes any successor entity) hereby promises to pay to
the order of [Conagra Foods, Inc.], or its successors or Permitted Assigns
(the " _Holder_ "), (a) the principal sum of ( $ ),
together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts
hereunder, including all such amounts increasing the principal hereof as a
result of the payment of PIK Interest (as defined below), on _
,_ 201 _ _ (the " _Scheduled Maturity Date_ ") (or such earlier or later
date as provided herein) and (b) interest on the principal amount of this  _
_% PIK Note due 201_ (as amended, modified, supplemented or restated, this "
_Note_ ") as follows. Interest on this Note will accrue from the date
hereof until paid in full at the rate of _ _% per annum (the "
_Interest Rate_ ") and shall be payable in United States dollars semiannually
in arrears on each [ _ _] and [ _
_], commencing on [ _ _], 2008 or if any such day is not
a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an " _Interest
Payment Date_ "); provided always that, notwithstanding the next succeeding
Business Day rule referred to above, if the Interest Payment Date falling on
the five-year anniversary date of the Issue Date is not a Business Day, then
such interest shall instead be payable on the first Business Day immediately
preceding the five-year anniversary date of the Issue Date. The six-month
period beginning the day after the Issue Date and each succeeding six-month
period thereafter    shall be considered an " _Accrual Period_ " within the meaning of Section
1272 (a)(5) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, if this Note remains
outstanding on the five-year anniversary date of the Issue Date, the first and
only Accrual Period ending after such five-year anniversary date shall end six
months after such five-year anniversary date (the " _Final Accrual Period_
"). Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months. The interest rate on this Note will in no event be
higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be
modified by United States law of general application.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent cash payment of this Note on the
Scheduled Maturity Date would then be prohibited by the terms of the Credit
Agreement, such cash payment shall be deferred until the earliest date that
any such cash payment would not be prohibited under the Credit Agreement;
_provided_ that (a) to the extent any cash payment continues to be prohibited
through and including the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, cash payment of
all such amounts will instead be due on the date that is five and one-half
years after the Issue Date and (b) in no event will any amounts evidenced by
this Note be due and payable in cash later than the date that is five and one-
half years after the Issue Date (it being understood and agreed that if the
Company fails to ensure that all such amounts are paid in cash no later than
the date that is five and one-half years after the Issue Date, an Event of
Default shall be deemed to have occurred). If any cash payment is deferred on
this Note or any other PIK Note, the per annum interest rate applicable
to all amounts outstanding under all PIK Notes during any such deferral shall
be two percent (2%) in excess of the otherwise applicable Interest Rate. After
the Scheduled Maturity Date, the Company shall not be permitted to make any
Restricted Payment under _Section 3.6(d)_ until all such deferred amounts
have been paid in full in cash. For the avoidance of doubt (but in any event
subject to clause (a) of this paragraph), on and after the Scheduled Maturity
Date the Company shall make all partial payments of amounts owing under this
Note up to the maximum amount that it is permitted to make without violating
the terms of the Credit Agreement, and the Company shall make a determination
of the ability to make such payments under the terms of such Credit Agreement
on the 15th day of each month and then make the maximum permitted payments of
the deferred portion of this Note promptly following such date of
determination. Further, to the extent that the Company has deferred any
amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to remove all impediments to cash payment of the deferred amounts
(and interest thereon), other than clause (a) of this
paragraph. Notwithstanding clause (a) of this paragraph, after the date that
is 91 days following the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date but on or before
the date that is five days prior to the end of the Final Accrual Period, the
Company shall pay in cash such amount of accrued and unpaid interest
(including PIK Interest) and original issue discount (as defined in Section
1273(a)(1) of the Code) on this Note, if any, as may be necessary to ensure
that this Note shall not be considered an "applicable high yield debt
obligation" within the meaning of Section 163(i) of the Code (it being
understood and agreed that if the Company fails to ensure that all such
amounts are paid in cash no later than the date that is five days prior to
the end of the Final Accrual Period, an Event of Default shall be deemed to
have occurred).

The Company shall pay interest on this Note, at the election of the Company
on each Interest Payment Date, (a) by increasing the principal amount of this
Note (" _PIK Interest_ "), (b) in cash to the Holder (" _Cash Interest_ ") or
(c) by any combination of (a) and (b), in an aggregate amount equal to the
accrued and unpaid interest on such date. Any interest due on an Interest  



 

2 Payment Date that is not paid by the Company as Cash Interest on such Interest
Payment Date shall be deemed paid as PIK Interest with no further action
required on the part of the Company. Following an increase in the principal
amount of this Note as a result of PIK Interest, this Note shall bear interest
on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such Interest
Payment Date.

operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or properties of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of the
Company to perform its obligations under this Note. 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and each Holder shall treat this

provide such members with funds to make distributions to their members so
that their direct or indirect members have funds to pay the tax liability
attributable to their share of the taxable income of the Company) (" _Tax
Distributions_ "), equal to the product of (i) the amount of taxable income

consultants and directors or managers in connection with any permitted
compensation and incentive arrangements _plus_ (iii) all amounts obtained

_plus_ (iv) any unused amounts under subclause (i) of this clause (c) from the
immediately preceding Fiscal Year;

of the PIK Notes to be purchased in such Offer to Purchase shall be at the
sole discretion of the Company) on the applicable Purchase Date; and

(2) the making of such Restricted Payment and the consummation of such Offer
to Purchase will not (A) if prior to such Restricted Payment the Indebtedness
under the Credit Agreement has an Investment Grade Rating, cause such
Indebtedness to fail to have an Investment Grade Rating (as confirmed in
advance by updated ratings that take into account such proposed Restricted
Payment and the consummation in full of such Offer to Purchase) or (B) if
prior to such Restricted Payment such Indebtedness does not have an Investment
Grade Rating, cause the Company Leverage Ratio to be less than two (2.0) (as
calculated on a pro forma basis, assuming the payment of such Restricted
Payment and that such Offer to Purchase is accepted in its entirety).

Payments in cash in an amount equal to up to 100% of such excess pursuant to
this _Section 3.6(e)_; _provided_ that the making of such Restricted Payment
will not cause the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement to fail to have an
Investment Grade Rating (as confirmed in advance by updated ratings that take
into account such proposed Restricted Payment).

(f) prior to and on the first anniversary of the Issue Date, so long as (i) no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or shall be caused
thereby and (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate cash contributed or otherwise
paid to the Company by investors on or before the Issue Date for Capital Stock
(other than Disqualified Stock) and (B) the aggregate cash received by the
Company on or before the Issue Date from the issuance of Junior Indebtedness

of (X) $700 million and (Y) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
PIK Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (other than
PIK Interest) as of the date of such Restricted Payment, the Company may make
Restricted Payments in cash in an amount equal to up to 100% of such excess
pursuant to this _Section 3.6(f)_.

(g) so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or
shall be caused thereby, the Company may make Restricted Payments within 30
days of the receipt of, and in an amount not to exceed the aggregate amount
of, net proceeds from the issuance of Junior Indebtedness of the Company.

(h) so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or

aggregate amount of (i) $5 million in any Fiscal Year _plus_ (ii) any unused
amounts under subclause (i) of this clause (h) from the immediately preceding
Fiscal Year;

 

(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries may redeem, repurchase, retire or
otherwise acquire Capital Stock of the Company so long as no cash payment
is made in respect thereof upon either (i) the exercise of warrants, options
or similar rights or (ii) the vesting of any compensatory Capital Stock of the
Company if such Capital Stock constitutes all or a portion of the exercise
price or is surrendered in connection with satisfying any federal, state or
local income tax obligation incurred in connection with such exercise or
vesting, _provided_ , _however_ , that if Capital Stock is surrendered in
connection with satisfying any federal, state, or local income tax
obligation, the Company shall be permitted to make a cash payment of the
amount necessary (but not more than such amount) (i) to enable the holder of
the Capital Stock to satisfy such income tax obligation, or (ii) to the
extent the Company is required under applicable law to withhold any amount of
such cash payment, to enable the Company to satisfy such withholding
obligation to the applicable Governmental Authority; and

(j) the Company and its Subsidiaries may make nominal cash payments in lieu of
the issuance of fractional shares in connection with the exercise
of warrants, options or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for
Capital Stock of the Company; _provided_ that any such cash payment shall not
be for the purpose of evading the limitations of this covenant.

SECTION 3.7 _Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Equity_.

The Company shall not:

(a) directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or
otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise,
with respect to (collectively " _incur_ ") any Indebtedness (including
Indebtedness incurred to refinance existing Indebtedness, but excluding
revolving borrowings under the Credit Agreement) that ranks senior in right of
payment to or _pari passu_ with the PIK Notes, the proceeds of which are used
or are to be used to fund Restricted Payments (other than Restricted Payments
made pursuant to _Section 3.6(a)_) to any holder of Equity Interests of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Company
Subsidiary;

(b) permit any Company Subsidiary (including CTG) to incur any Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness incurred to refinance existing Indebtedness,
but excluding revolving borrowings under the Credit Agreement), the proceeds
of which are used or are to be used to fund Restricted Payments (other than
Restricted Payments made pursuant to _Section 3.6(a)_) to any holder of
Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than a Wholly
Owned Company Subsidiary;

(c) permit any Company Subsidiary (including CTG) to guarantee any
Indebtedness referred to in (a) or (b) above;



 

28 (d) guarantee, or permit any Company Subsidiary (including CTG) to guarantee,
any Indebtedness of the Company (other than Indebtedness incurred under the
Credit Agreement and hedge agreements and cash management related to the
Credit Agreement) or any Person other than any Company Subsidiary (including
CTG); or

(e) issue, or permit any Company Subsidiary (including CTG) to issue,
Disqualified Stock, the proceeds of which are used or are to be used to fund
Restricted Payments to any holder of Equity Interests of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Company Subsidiary;

_provided however_ , that the restrictions set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c)
and (e) of this _Section 3.7_ shall not apply with respect to, but only to
the extent of, Restricted Payments made pursuant to  _Section 3.6(g)_.

SECTION 3.8 _Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates._

The Company will not, and will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, directly
or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, assign, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any
property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction
(including any sales or issuances of Equity Interests of any Company
Subsidiary (including CTG) or the capital contribution of cash or assets to
any Company Subsidiary), contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or
guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any Related Party of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or Sponsor (each, an " _Affiliate Transaction_ ") unless such
Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or
the relevant Company Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable arms-length transaction by the Company or such Company Subsidiary
with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary or a Related Party of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
Sponsor,  _provided_ that (x) in no event shall any Equity Interests of any
Company Subsidiary, joint venture or other entity whose capital stock is owned
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary be issued, sold or otherwise
transferred to the Sponsor or any Related Party thereof and (y) to the extent
any Affiliate Transaction or any series of related Affiliated Transactions
involve aggregate payments or other property with a fair market value in
excess of $55 million, the Company or relevant Company Subsidiary shall
obtain an opinion as to the fairness of such transaction or series of related
transactions to the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be,
from a financial point of view, from an independent financial advisor of
recognized national standing and deliver the same to Holder. The following
items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not
be subject to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_:

(1) any transaction between the Company or a Company Subsidiary, on one hand,
and a Company Subsidiary, joint venture or similar entity, on the other,
which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or
a Company Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such
Company Subsidiary, joint venture or similar entity, _provided_ the
Sponsor or any Related Party of the Sponsor does not have an equity interest
in or control of such second Person other than through the Company;



 

29 (2) Restricted Payments permitted by this Note;

(3) payments in respect of employment, consulting, severance and any other

(5) any transaction with a Receivables Subsidiary effected as part of a

(9) making loans or advances to officers, employees or consultants of the

SECTION 3.9 _Offer to Purchase upon Change of Control_.

(a) If a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company at such time has given
notice of redemption under _Section 2.5_ with respect to all amounts
outstanding under this Note, the Holder will have the right to require the
Company to repurchase all or any part of this Note pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer on the terms set forth in this Note. In the Change of Control
Offer, the Company will offer a payment in cash equal to 100% of the aggregate
principal amount of the portion of this Note to be repurchased plus accrued
and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase. Within 30 days following
any Change of Control, unless the Company at such time has given notice of
redemption under _Section 2.5_ with respect to all amounts outstanding under
this Note, or, at the Companys option, in advance of a Change of Control,
the Company will make an Offer to Purchase containing information describing
the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase the Note on the specified Payment Date pursuant to
the procedures required by this Note and described in such notice.



 

30 (b) The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a
Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in
the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in this Note applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company
and purchases this Note (or the portions thereof) when properly tendered and
not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption
has been given pursuant to _Section 2.5_ of this Note unless and until there
is a default in the payment of the applicable Redemption Price. A Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control and may be
conditional upon the occurrence of a Change of Control if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of
Control Offer is made.

(c) The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change
of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or
not any other provisions of this Note are applicable.

The Company will comply, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply,

(a) The Company will not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
amend, modify, restate, supplement, renew, replace or otherwise change
Section [ _ _]3 of the Credit Agreement in a manner which would

to make payments on the PIK Notes to more restrictive provisions than those
applicable to Restricted Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the
purpose of making payments (other than Tax Distributions) to the holders of
the equity interests in the Company (i) in respect of their equity interests
or (ii) in the form of periodic management fees pursuant to the Management

payments on the PIK Notes (or any of the related definitions contained or
referenced in any such provision) or (ii) the Company fails to use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent any future impediments under

impediments thereunder), or under the terms of any future Indebtedness, to
cash payments under this Note that are otherwise due upon the Scheduled

ARTICLE VI

SUBORDINATION

SECTION 6.1 _Agreement To Subordinate_.

The Company agrees, and the Holder by accepting this Note agrees, that the
payment of all obligations owing in respect of this Note is subordinated in
right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this _Article
VI_ , to the prior payment in full of all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness of the Company and that the subordination is for the benefit of
and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. This Note shall in
all respects rank _pari_   _passu_ in right of payment with all existing and
future Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, and will be senior in
right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated



 

36 Indebtedness of the Company; and only Indebtedness of the Company that is
Senior Indebtedness shall rank senior to this Note in accordance with the
provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this _Article VI_ shall be
subject to _Section 6.12_.

SECTION 6.2 _Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy_.

Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company to creditors
upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the
Company or in a reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the
Company or its property:

(a) the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to
receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness (including
interest accruing after, or which would accrue but for, the commencement of
any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior
Indebtedness, whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed)
before the Holder of this Note shall be entitled to receive any payment; and

(b) until the Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full in cash, any
payment or distribution to which the Holder of this Note would be entitled but
for the subordination provisions of this Note shall be made to holders of such
Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except the Holder of this
Note may receive and retain Permitted Junior Securities; and

(c) if a distribution is made to the Holder that, due to the subordination
provisions, should not have been made to it, the Holder is required to hold it
in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over
to them as their interests may appear.

SECTION 6.3 _Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company_.

The Company shall not pay principal of, premium, if any, or interest on this
Note (or pay any other obligations relating to this Note, including fees,
costs, expenses, indemnities and rescission or damage claims) and may not
purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Notes (collectively, " _pay the
Notes_ ") (except that the Holder of this Note may receive and retain
Permitted Junior Securities), if either of the following occurs (a "
_Payment Default_ "):

(a) a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest
on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and is continuing
or any other amount owing in respect of any Designated Senior Indebtedness of
the Company is not paid when due, or

(b) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs
and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is
accelerated in accordance with its terms,

unless, in either case, the Default has been cured or waived and any such
acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has
been paid in full in cash; _provided_ ,



 

37 _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to pay this Note without regard
to the foregoing if the Company receives written notice approving such
payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with
respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing.

During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) (a "
_Non-Payment Default_ ") with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness
of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated
without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such
acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company
shall not pay this Note (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities)
for a period (a " _Payment Blockage Period_ ") commencing upon the receipt by
the Company of written notice (a " _Blockage Notice_ ") of such Non-
Payment Default from the Representative of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and
ending 179 days thereafter. With respect to Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement, a Blockage Notice may be given only by the administrative agent
thereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the requisite lenders
named therein. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment
Blockage Period is terminated (i) by written notice to the Company from the
Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (ii) because the default
giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer
continuing; or (iii) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been
repaid in full in cash.

Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding
paragraph (but subject to the provisions contained in the first paragraph of
this _Section 6.3_ and _Section 6.2_ hereof), unless the holders of such
Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness or a Payment Default exists, the Company shall be permitted to
resume paying this Note after the end of such Payment Blockage Period
(including any missed payments). This Note shall not be subject to more than
one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360 day period, irrespective of
the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness during
such period; _provided_ that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the
Company by or on behalf of the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of
the Company (other than the holders of Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement), a Representative of holders of Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no
event shall the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period
or Periods on the Note is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during
any consecutive 360 day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no
default or event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of
commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to Designated Senior
Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made,
the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of
such Designated Senior Indebtedness whether or not within a period of 360
consecutive days unless such default shall have been cured or waived for
a period of not less than 90 consecutive days (it being acknowledged that any
subsequent action, or any breach of any financial covenants during the period
after the date of delivery of a Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would
give rise to a Non-Payment Default pursuant to any provisions of the
Designated Senior Indebtedness under which a Non-Payment Default previously
existed or was continuing shall constitute a new Non-Payment Default for this
purpose).



 

38 SECTION 6.4 _Acceleration of Payment of Notes_.

If payment of this Note is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the
Company shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior
Indebtedness of the Company or the Representative of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness of the acceleration; provided that any failure to give such
notice shall have no effect whatsoever on the provisions of this _Article VI_.
If any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is outstanding, the
Company may not pay this Note until five Business Days after the
Representatives of all the issuers of such Designated Senior Indebtedness
receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay this Note only
if this Note otherwise permits payment at that time.

SECTION 6.5 _When Distribution Must Be Paid Over_.

If a distribution is made to the Holder that, due to the subordination
provisions, should not have been made to it, the Holder is required to hold it
in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and pay it
over to them as their interests may appear.

SECTION 6.6  _Subrogation_.

After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until this
Note is paid in full, the Holder shall be subrogated to the rights of holders
of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior
Indebtedness. A distribution made under this _Article VI_ to holders of such
Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to the Holder is
not, as between the Company and the Holder, a payment by the Company on such
Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 6.7  _Relative Rights_ _._

This _Article VI_ defines the relative rights of the Holder and holders of
Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Note shall:

(a) impair, as between the Company and the Holder, the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and
interest on this Note in accordance with its terms;

(b) prevent the Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default,
subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to
receive payments or distributions otherwise payable to the Holder and such
other rights of such holders of Senior Indebtedness as set forth herein; or

(c) affect the relative rights of the Holder and creditors of the Company
other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 6.8 _Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Company_.

No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the
subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall be impaired by
any act or failure to act by the Company or by their failure to comply with
this Note.



 

39 SECTION 6.9 _Distribution or Notice to Representative_.

Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, the distribution may be made and the
notice given to their Representative (if any).

SECTION 6.10 _Article VI Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To
Accelerate_. 

The failure to make a payment pursuant to this Note by reason of any provision
in this _Article VI_ shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a
Default. Nothing in this _Article VI_ shall have any effect on the right of
the Holder to accelerate the maturity of the Note.

SECTION 6.11 _Holder Entitled To Rely_.

Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this _Article VI_ , the Holder
shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any order or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in _Section
6.2_ hereof are pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or
agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Holder or (c)
upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose
of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or
distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness
of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts
paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this 
_Article VI_.

SECTION 6.12 _Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on
Subordination Provisions_.

 

The Holder by accepting this Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing
subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and
a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company,
whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the
issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to
hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness
shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions
in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior
Indebtedness.

Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any time and from
time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Holder, without
incurring responsibility to the Holder and without impairing or releasing the
subordination provided in this _Article VI_ or the obligations hereunder of
the Holder to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company, do any
one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment
or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness of
the Company, or, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Note,
otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness of the Company
or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior
Indebtedness of the Company is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or
otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing
Senior Indebtedness of the Company;



 

40 (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of
Senior Indebtedness of the Company; and (iv) exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person.

other than to an Affiliate of the Holder, the Company shall have no
obligations under the Limited Covenants vis-a-vis the transferee of this Note

portion of the aggregate principal amount of this Note that is not being
Transferred). Such Persons shall execute such replacement Note(s), agreeing to
be bound by the provisions thereof. The Company shall maintain a register of
the holders of this Note (or any portion hereof) and promptly enter therein

43 SECTION 7.3 _No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and
Stockholders._

 

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder, unitholder or
member of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its direct
or indirect parent companies, as such, will have any liability for any
obligations of the Company under this Note or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. The Holder by
accepting this Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of this Note. The waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws,
and it is the view of the Commission that such waiver is against public
policy.

SECTION 7.4 _Governing Law._

THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO
CONSTRUE THIS NOTE.

SECTION 7.5 _No Adverse Interpretation of Other Agreements._

This Note may not be used to interpret any other indenture, loan or debt
agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of any other Person. Any such
indenture, loan or debt agreement may not be used to interpret this Note.

SECTION 7.6 _Successors._

All agreements of the Company in this Note shall bind its successors. Other
than in compliance with Article IV, the Company may not assign its rights or
obligations hereunder or any interest therein. All agreements of the Holder
in this Note shall bind and shall inure to the benefit of Holder and its
successors and Permitted Assigns. Nothing in this Note, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and Permitted Assigns) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Note.

SECTION 7.7 _Severability._

In case any provision in this Note shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 7.8 _Table of Contents, Headings, Etc._

The Table of Contents, Cross-Reference Table and Headings of the Articles and
Sections of this Note have been inserted for convenience of reference only,
are not to be considered a part of this Note and shall in no way modify or
restrict any of the terms or provisions hereof.

SECTION 7.9 _Acts of Holder._

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
other action provided by this Note to be given or taken by the Holder may be
embodied in and evidenced by



 

44 one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by the Holder in
person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments are delivered to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and
the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes
referred to as the " _Act_ " of the Holder signing such instrument or
instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing
appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this
Note and conclusive in favor of the Company, if made in the manner provided
in this _Section 7.9_.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by
a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such
instrument or writing acknowledged to such officer the execution thereof.
Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than such
signers individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall
also constitute sufficient proof of such signers authority. The fact and
date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of
the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which
the Company deems sufficient.

(c) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
other Act of the Holder shall bind every future Holder in respect of anything
done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Company in reliance thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon this Note.

SECTION 7.10 _Confidentiality_.

The Holder shall hold confidential all non-public information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their businesses provided by the Company
pursuant to the requirements hereof, it being understood and agreed by the
Company that, in any event, the Holder may make (i) to the extent necessary
to the administration hereof, disclosures on a confidential basis of such
information to Affiliates of the Holder and to their agents and advisors, (ii)
disclosures of such information reasonably required by any bona fide or
potential transferee in connection with the contemplated Transfer of this
Note or any portion thereof pursuant to _Section 7.1_ hereof, provided such
potential transferee first executes a confidentiality agreement with the
Company containing substantially the same terms as this _Section 7.10_,
(iii) disclosure to any rating agency when required by it, _provided_ that
such rating agency shall preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries received by it from
the Company in accordance with customary market practice, (iv) disclosures
necessary for the preservation and enforcement of Holders rights hereunder
and (v) disclosures required by law, including as requested by any
governmental agency or representative thereof or pursuant to legal or judicial
process; _provided_ , unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or
court order, the Holder shall make reasonable efforts to notify the
Company of any request by any governmental agency or representative thereof
(other than any such request in connection with any examination of the
financial condition or other routine examination of such Lender by such
governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non public information prior
to disclosure of such information. Notwithstanding anything above to the
contrary in this _Section 7.10_, each Person otherwise subject hereto may
disclose any information relating to the tax treatment and tax



 

45 structure of this Note; _provided_ , however, that any information relating to
such tax treatment and tax structure shall remain subject to the
confidentiality provisions in this _Section 7.10_ to the extent reasonably
necessary to enable such Person, their respective Affiliates, and their
respective Affiliates directors and employees to comply with applicable
securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" means any facts relevant to
the federal income tax treatment of the Note.

SECTION 7.11 _Amendment, Supplement and Waiver_.

(a) Except as provided below in this  _Section 7.11_, this Note may be
amended or supplemented with the consent of the Company and the Majority PIK
Noteholders, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with
any provision of this Note may be waived with the consent of the Company and
the Majority PIK Noteholders (and/or any acceleration of the amounts owing
under this Note pursuant to _Section 5.2_ rescinded and annulled), even if,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Holder of this Note does not consent thereto.
In connection with any approved amendment of this Note, the Holder of this
Note shall promptly surrender the same to the Company for cancellation, and
the Company shall upon receipt thereof promptly issue in favor of the Holder
an amended Note in exchange therefor, such amended Note to contain the
approved amendments but to be on terms otherwise identical to this Note and
upon the issue of such amended Note, this Note shall be deemed null and void
with no further action required on the part of the Company or the Holder.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this _Section 7.11_ becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the holders of PIK Notes affected thereby
a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure
of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however,
in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or
waiver.

The Majority PIK Noteholders may waive compliance in a particular instance by
the Company with any provision of this Note. However, without the consent of
each Holder of a PIK Note affected, an amendment or waiver under this _Section
7.11_ may not (with respect to any PIK Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

(i) reduce or forgive or change the time for payment of the principal amount
of PIK Notes;

(ii) reduce or forgive the principal of, or change any date fixed for the
payment of any amounts in respect of , any PIK Note;

(iii) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any
PIK Note;

(iv) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of,
or interest on, the Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Note by
the Majority PIK Noteholders and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);

(v) make any change in the provisions of this Note relating to waivers of past
Defaults or the rights of the Holder of this Note to receive payments
of principal of, or interest on, the Note;



 

46 (vi) amend, change or modify the obligation of the Company to make and
consummate an Offer to Purchase pursuant to _Section 3.6(d)_ in accordance
therewith after the obligation to make such an Offer to Purchase has arisen,
or the obligation of the Company to make and consummate a Change of Control
Offer in the event of a Change in Control in accordance with Section 3.9 after
such Change of Control has occurred, including, in each case, amending,
changing or modifying any definition relating thereto; _provided_ that,
with respect to any amendment, change or modification of _Section 3.9_ (or
any definition relating thereto) prior to the occurrence of such Change of
Control, such amendment, change or modification must be approved by Holders of
66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes then outstanding;
or

(vii) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.

(b) Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to
it by the Holder of this Note is a continuing consent by such Holder and every
subsequent Holder of a this Note or portion thereof, even if notation of the
consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder
may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Company receives written notice
of revocation before the date the Majority PIK Noteholders agree thereto.
An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its
terms and thereafter binds the Holder, even if the Holder has not consented
thereto.

(c) The Company may place an appropriate notation about an amendment,
supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter issued by it, and at the written
request of any Holder of a PIK Note shall issue such Holder a replacement PIK
Note that reflects the amendment, supplement or waiver. Lack of notation of
any such amendment, supplement or waiver, or issuance of a new Note reflecting
any such amendment, supplement or waiver, shall not affect the validity
and effect of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.

WHEAT BY-PRODUCTS SUPPLY AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT, made this _ _ day of  _ _, 2008 (the
"Effective Date"), by and between ConAgra Trade Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, ("CTG") and ConAgra Foods Food Ingredients Company, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Supplier"). CTG and Supplier shall be referred to
herein individually as "Party" and collectively as "Parties."

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, Supplier owns volumes of Wheat Midds, Red Dog, Pellets and Organic
Midds ("Wheat By-Products") and desires to sell Wheat By-Products to CTG.

WHEREAS, CTG desires to purchase Wheat By-Products from Supplier.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals which are
incorporated with and are made a part of this Agreement, and in further
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained,
the Parties hereto agree, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, as follows:

1\. PURCHASE OF PRODUCT. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Supplier
agrees to sell exclusively to CTG, and CTG agrees to purchase, all Wheat By-
Products produced at Supplier Flour Mills. The term "Supplier Flour Mills"
shall include those flour mills listed on Exhibit "A" attached hereto and
incorporated herein.

2\. PRICE AND PAYMENT.

A. PRICE. Each Wheat By-Product purchased by CTG shall be priced pursuant to
the daily midds bid sheet CTG provides to Supplier (the "Bid Sheet"), except
(i) all Wheat By-Products produced in pellet form at CTGs request shall
include a $10.00 per ton upcharge, and (ii) all Red Dog and Organic midds
prices will be increased by an amount equal to the then current Red Dog and
Organic midds market price spreads and all Red Dog and Organic midds shipments
will be applied to midds contracts. Bid Sheets will contain the current
market-based bids for midds for each Supplier Flour Mill by month for the next
12 month period and shall be effective until CTGs next Bid Sheet is provided
to Supplier. CTG agrees, at a minimum, to provide an updated Bid Sheet to
Supplier daily and CTG reserves the right to update the Bid Sheet on an
intraday basis. The purchase price for the Wheat By-Products sold hereunder
will be based on the daily bid as listed on the Bid Sheet corresponding
to the date of order and shall be set forth in a written confirmation signed
by the Parties.

B. LIQUIDITY. Each day, Supplier shall be allowed to price up to one thousand
five hundred (1,500) tons per month per Supplier Flour Mill for each of the
twelve (12) months listed on the Bid Sheet subject, however, to a total daily
maximum of 25,000 tons; provided, however, Supplier may not price more than
its aggregate average monthly production (such average based on the monthly
production during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the date
each Bid Sheet is provided to Supplier) at the applicable Supplier Flour Mill
for any given month. CTG agrees to make a reasonable attempt to accommodate
Suppliers  



 

1  additional liquidity and may, in its reasonable discretion, purchase from
Supplier volumes in addition to the amounts provided for above; provided,
however, the sales will be made via a verbal confirmation of the price and
volume from CTG to Supplier, with a written confirmation to follow. The
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to apply all contract
volumes evenly over the contracted period.

C. INVOICING, SHIPMENT ORDERS, BILLING AND PAYMENT. CTG and Supplier agree to
work together on an ongoing basis to maintain or enhance transaction process
efficiencies; including, but not limited to, establishing an automated daily
order entry and invoicing process to manage costs for both Supplier and CTG.
Supplier shall invoice CTG daily for all Wheat By-Products sold hereunder.
The terms of invoice payment shall be net 15 days after invoice date.

3\. MARKET INFORMATION. An important component of the service Supplier
provides to its flour milling customers is to inform its customers of general
market and industry conditions, including information relating to the mill
feed industry. Upon Suppliers request, CTG will provide Supplier with CTGs
general insight and opinions on market, economic and political factors and
conditions which may impact or affect the mill feed industry generally.

4\. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and
shall continue for four (4) years (the "Initial Term"). The term of this
Agreement may be extended on a one year basis (the "Renewal Term") upon mutual
written agreement of the parties executed at least one hundred and eighty
(180) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. 

5\. SALES TO THIRD PARTIES. The Parties hereby acknowledge that from time to
time a third party may be willing to pay a higher price for a Wheat By-
Product than CTGs price for such Wheat By-Product set forth on the Bid Sheet.
Supplier shall have the right to sell such Wheat By-Product to such third
party, subject to the following terms:

A. The Wheat By-Product sale is for delivery more than 30 days in the future.

B. The Wheat By-Product sale is subject to CTGs right to match the price
offered by the third party. Any such sale is subject to CTGs right, for a
period of four (4) hours after notice from Supplier, to match the third-party
purchasers higher price. If CTG notifies Supplier of its decision to match
the third-party purchasers price, within such time period, the sale will not
be consummated by Supplier to the third-party. CTGs failure to notify
Supplier within four (4) hours of its decision to match the third-party
purchasers price shall be a waiver of CTGs right to match the third-
party purchasers price.

C. At Suppliers option, CTG will purchase the Wheat By-Product from Supplier
and immediately re-sell the Wheat By-Product to the third party at the third
party offered price; provided, however, Supplier will continue to be
responsible for all credit risk associated with the third partys payment of
the invoice resulting from such sale. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
CTGs facilitation of Suppliers third party Wheat By-Products sales enhance
efficiencies relating to such matters as order scheduling and fulfillment,
transportation logistics and the like, with the goal of providing the most
competitive flour prices to Suppliers flour customers.



 

2 D. Supplier will reimburse CTG for expenses related to Suppliers use of a CTG
Private Car, where applicable. In the event the shipment of Wheat By-Products
is made to a third party in a CTG Private Car, CTG and Supplier agree to
calculate freight rates for third party sales based on the tariff rates plus
CTGs reasonably incurred costs associated with the CTG Private Car. CTG will
invoice Supplier for such expenses. "CTG Private Car" shall mean any railcar
provided by CTG, whether owned, leased, borrowed or contracted.

6\. QUALITY. All Wheat By-Products sold and delivered hereunder shall conform
to the specifications listed on Exhibit "B" hereto. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6 AND SECTION 10 BELOW, SUPPLIER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARD TO THE WHEAT
BY-PRODUCTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. In the event any mill feed used to
manufacture Wheat By-Products hereunder is expected to contain vomotoxin
levels greater than 5 ppm, then the Parties shall work together in good faith
to determine the price to be paid by CTG for such Wheat By-Products.

7\. WEIGHTS/GRADES. The Wheat By-Products will be weighed on certified scales
in accordance with the applicable procedures and methods of the state in
which the Wheat By-Products are loaded. Weights shall be final at the time of
loading of the Wheat By-Products on CTGs transportation carriers at Supplier
Flour Mills. The Parties agree that such weights shall govern for purposes of
this Agreement and that all invoices shall be settled accordingly; provided,
however, in the event that the certified scales are determined to be
inaccurate, then appropriate adjustments shall be made and the Parties shall
settle on the newly determined accurate weight.

8\. SUPPLIER SCHEDULING RESPONSIBILITIES. Supplier agrees to provide to CTG,
on a daily basis, the following information to allow CTG to arrange for and
make scheduling decisions with respect to transportation carriers: (a) Wheat
By-Product inventories; (b) a seven (7) day Wheat By-Product production
forecast; and (c) twenty-four (24) hour advance notice of any additions or
reductions in Supplier Flour Mill operation and runtime.

9. SHIPPING TERMS

A. RISK OF LOSS. All Wheat By-Products purchased hereunder shall be F.O.B.
Supplier Flour Mills. Supplier shall be responsible for inspecting all
applicable transportation equipment for debris, foreign material or ruminant
animal products that are prohibited under applicable laws or industry
standards and immediately notify CTG upon the discovery of or suspicion of
the presence of such debris. CTG shall be responsible to remove any such
contaminants and clean such transportation equipment so it is fit for purposes
of transporting the Wheat By-Products or arrange for substitute transportation
equipment. CTG agrees to provide transportation equipment that is approved by
Supplier and complies with all applicable laws and industry standards.
Supplier will be responsible for maintaining all  



 

3  appropriate inspection records, in a manner consistent with past practice
and in accordance with applicable laws. Supplier retains title and risk of
loss to the Wheat By-Products until the same are loaded on the transportation
equipment supplied by CTG.

B. SUPPLIER LOADING OBLIGATIONS. Supplier shall (i) provide adequate labor
and loading hours to accommodate the loading schedule agreed upon by Supplier
and CTG and (ii) load all transportation equipment to full visible capacity,
not to exceed the maximum legal gross weight limit. In the event the
transportation equipment is not loaded to capacity, Supplier shall pay that
portion of freight charges allocable to the unused capacity of the applicable
transportation equipment and shall notify CTG within one (1) business day of
the occurrence of such partial load. In the event CTGs transportation
equipment departs from Supplier Flour Mill prior to being loaded to capacity,
Supplier will not be liable for the freight charges allocable to the partial
load. 

C. CTGS DEMURRAGE OBLIGATIONS. CTG shall be responsible for demurrage that
occurs prior to the arrival of CTGs transportation equipment at the Supplier
Flour Mills for receipt of the Wheat By-Products, and after delivery and
acceptance of the Wheat By Products by CTG.

D. SUPPLIERS DEMURRAGE OBLIGATIONS. Supplier shall be solely responsible for
demurrage, as applicable, in the following manner: demurrage for the delivery
of empty rail cars to the Supplier Flour Mill begins to accrue forty eight
(48) hours after the rail car has reached the Supplier Flour Mill provided
that the rail car arrives at the Supplier Flour Mill between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays observed by
the Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago, Illinois, USA ("Normal Operating Hours"),
otherwise demurrage will begin to accrue forty eight (48) hours after the
start of Normal Operating Hours following the arrival of the rail car to the
Supplier Flour Mill. Demurrage for the delivery of empty trucks to the
Supplier Flour Mill begins to accrue after the second (2 nd) hour that the
truck waits to be loaded at the Supplier Flour Mill provided the truck arrived
during Normal Operating Hours.

10\. TITLE. Supplier represents and warrants that it has the full right to
sell Wheat By-Products to CTG and that it has and will have good title to
all Wheat By-Products to be sold and delivered hereunder and that the same
shall be free from all liens, claims and encumbrances of whatsoever nature. In
the event any of the Wheat By-Products sold to CTG is encumbered in any
manner, Supplier agrees to furnish CTG, in a form acceptable to CTG, a sworn
statement listing all liens, if any, to which the load of Wheat By-Products is
subject, together with authorization and release of liens in a form acceptable
to CTG from the person or entity holding a lien on the Wheat By-Products
prior to loading of the Wheat By-Products. Supplier agrees to indemnify and
hold CTG harmless, in addition to indemnifications listed in Section 13, from
any and all costs, damages, claims or expenses, including attorneys fees,
CTG may incur as a result of Supplier breaching the provisions of this Section
10\.



 

4 11\. INVENTORY HANDLING AND TRANSFERS; RECORDS. CTGs obligations with respect
to inventory handling and records include the following:

A. CTG will arrange for shipping of the Wheat By-Products from Supplier Flour
Mills. Supplier shall cooperate with CTG in connection with all such
shipments. Supplier shall provide and be responsible for the loading of all
Wheat By-Products into the transportation equipment arranged by CTG.

B. CTG agrees to provide Supplier with reasonable logistical and scheduling
support to ensure a smooth execution of all loading and shipping
activities related to the Wheat By-Products. CTG will also advise Supplier on
tracking railcar locations with respect to the transportation of Wheat By-
Products as well as estimated arrival times of such transportation equipment
to Supplier Flour Mills in an effort to avoid and reduce demurrages and
related costs. CTG will also work directly with Suppliers staff to adjust
shipment schedules to production and manage around unexpected increases and
decreases in production.

C. CTG agrees to dedicate railcars to the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement ("Dedicated Railcars"), with the initial number of Dedicated
Railcars detailed on _Exhibit "C"_. CTG shall update _Exhibit "C"_ on a
quarterly basis during the Initial and any Renewal Term of this Agreement and
Suppliers obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Dedicated
Railcars shall be to those Dedicated Railcars reflected on the most recently
updated version of _Exhibit "C"_. If Supplier breaches any of its obligations
under this Agreement, fails to cure such breaches as set forth herein, and
such uncured breach causes CTG to be unable to fulfill its lease obligations
with respect to the Dedicated Railcars, Supplier shall be responsible for any
resulting damages during the Term of this Agreement relating to the Dedicated
Railcars which are solely and directly due to such uncured breach including,
but not limited to, Suppliers assumption of the Dedicated Railcar leases at
market prices. If CTG breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement
and fails to cure such breaches as set forth herein, in addition to all other
rights and remedies available to Supplier hereunder in connection with such
breach, CTG shall assign to Supplier the Dedicated Railcar leases at market
prices and Supplier shall assume CTGs obligations under such Dedicated
Railcar leases which accrue from and after the date of assignment.

D. CTG agrees to take delivery of the Wheat By-Products according to the
terms provided in this Agreement. In the event CTGs failure to take delivery
for the Wheat By-Products solely and directly causes a Supplier Flour Mill to
shut down, CTG shall pay Supplier $2,000 per hour of such shutdown.

12\. CTGs WARRANTY. CTG warrants that it will sell the Wheat By-Products
purchased from Supplier Flour Mills exclusively to customers who operate in
whole or in part as animal feed processors. CTG makes no warranty beyond that
stated herein and makes no warranty as to any subsequent sales by any of its
customers or affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Supplier
and CTG, CTG shall be solely liable for any breaches of this provision by
CTGs customers and shall indemnify Supplier from any and all claims, losses,
costs and expenses asserted against Supplier relating to sales of Wheat By-
Products outside animal feed channels.

13\. SUPPLIERS INDEMNITY. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Supplier shall indemnify, defend and hold CTG and its officers, directors,
employees and agents  



 

5  harmless, from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), costs, claims, and demands that CTG or
its officers, directors, employees or agents may suffer, sustain or become
subject to, or result from or arise in connection with (a) any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty, covenant or agreement of Supplier
contained herein or (b) Suppliers negligence or willful misconduct. In
connection with the foregoing, Supplier agrees to maintain in force and
effect, during the term of this Agreement, commercial and general liability
insurance coverage, including products liability, with an insurance carrier
that maintains an A.M. Best rating of "A" or better, with CTG named as an
additional insured for claims arising from Suppliers negligence with minimum
limits of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence. Supplier shall
furnish CTG with a certificate of such insurance within thirty (30) days and
will require insurer to notify CTG thirty (30) days in advance of any
cancellation or adverse change in coverage.

14\. CTGS INDEMNITY. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, CTG
shall indemnify, defend and hold Supplier and its officers,
directors, employees and agents harmless, from any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), costs,
claims, and demands that Supplier or its officers, directors, employees or
agents may suffer, sustain or become subject to, or result from or arise in
connection with (a) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, covenant or
agreement of CTG contained herein or (b) CTGs negligence or willful
misconduct. In connection with the foregoing, CTG agrees to maintain in force
and effect, during the term of this Agreement, commercial and general
liability insurance coverage, including products liability, with an insurance
carrier that maintains an A.M. Best rating of "A" or better, with Supplier
named as an additional insured for claims arising from CTGs negligence with
minimum limits of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence. CTG shall
furnish Supplier with a certificate of such insurance within thirty (30) days
and will require the insurer to notify Supplier thirty (30) days in advance of
any cancellation or adverse change in coverage.

15\. FORCE MAJEURE. In the event either Party hereto is rendered unable,
wholly or in part, by Force Majeure, as defined below, to carry out its
obligations under this Agreement, upon such Party giving written notice and
full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as possible
after the occurrence of the cause relied on, the obligations of the Party
giving such notice, so far as they are affected by Force Majeure, shall be

12 EXHIBIT D

_GRAIN STORAGE AND HANDLING AGREEMENT_

THIS GRAIN STORAGE AND HANDLING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated _
_, 2008 (the "Commencement Date") is between CONAGRA FOODS FOOD INGREDIENTS
COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("ConAgra") and CONAGRA TRADE GROUP,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("CTG").

_RECITALS:_

WHEREAS, ConAgra is the owner of a flour mill located in Saginaw, Texas, which
requires a consistent supply of grain for ConAgras operations; and 

WHEREAS, to establish the necessary supply of grain for its flour mill, an
affiliate of ConAgra purchased a grain elevator located in Saginaw, Texas, on
real property more particularly described on the attached _Exhibit "A"_ (the
"Elevator"), which Elevator is adjacent to and connected with ConAgras flour
mill; and

WHEREAS, such affiliate subsequently transferred and conveyed legal title to
the Elevator to CTG which, prior to the date hereof, was also an affiliate of
ConAgra; and

WHEREAS, CTG provided ConAgra with grain storage and handling services at the
Elevator; and

WHEREAS, on the date hereof, ownership and control of CTG was transferred and
conveyed to  _ _, an entity unrelated to ConAgra, and

WHEREAS, as ConAgra and CTG are now unrelated entities, each party desires to
enter into this Agreement relating to the grain storage and handling services
at the Elevator to be provided to ConAgra by CTG on a basis consistent with
past practices.

_AGREEMENT:_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein set forth, and other good and valuable consideration,
ConAgra and CTG hereby covenant and agree as follows:

 

1\. _Elevator_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CTG
agrees to provide to ConAgra up to seven million (7,000,000) total bushels of
grain storage space at the Elevator. Thereafter, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the first day of each calendar quarter during the Initial Term and
any Renewal Term of this Agreement ("Calendar Quarter"), ConAgra shall advise
CTG in writing of ConAgras total bushels of grain storage space it requires
at the Elevator during said Calendar Quarter; provided, however, without CTGs
prior consent, in no event shall ConAgra be entitled to more than seven
million (7,000,000) total bushels of grain storage space at the Elevator
during any Calendar Quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
ConAgra requests additional storage space at the Elevator during any Calendar
Quarter, and CTG has such space available, CTG shall make such additional
space available to ConAgra during such Calendar Quarter subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. All grain stored at the Elevator for ConAgra
under this Agreement shall at all times be identity-preserved. All grain
unloaded and stored at the Elevator by ConAgra shall at all times remain the
sole and exclusive property of ConAgra. 2\. Term.



     | 2.1 | _Initial Term_. The "Initial Term" of this Agreement shall
be twenty (20) years after the Commencement Date. 
---|---|--- 


     | 2.2 | _Renewal Term_. Upon termination of the Initial Term, this
Agreement shall automatically renew for four (4) additional terms of twenty
(20) years (each, a "Renewal Term"), unless ConAgra provides written notice
to CTG not later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-current
term of ConAgras desire to terminate the Agreement as of the end of the then-
current term. The fees due CTG under this Agreement shall remain unchanged
for five (5) years after the Commencement Date, with such fees then adjusted
according to the methodology set forth in the attached _Exhibit "B"_ every two
(2) years thereafter. 
---|---|--- 

3\. _Put Through Services_. CTG agrees to provide all labor and equipment
necessary to put ConAgras grain through the Elevator and to perform other
standard put through services as reasonably requested by ConAgra, all on a
basis consistent with the put through services at the Elevator provided by CTG
to ConAgra prior to the date hereof. The put through services provided
hereunder by CTG shall be on a gross-in, gross-out basis in respect to wheat
dockage. ConAgra acknowledges that the Elevator is designed to accommodate
only certain types of trucks and railcars. ConAgra agrees to deliver grain to
the Elevator via trucks and railcars for which the Elevator is designed.
Throughout the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, CTG shall have the right to
reject delivery of any grain which CTG reasonably finds in non-warehousable
condition (as established in the grain warehousemans industry).

4\. _Truck and Car Unloading and Loading_. ConAgra shall pay to CTG $.025 per
bushel for each bushel of grain unloaded into the Elevator from shuttle train
railcars, $.04 per bushel for each bushel of grain unloaded from trucks or
non-shuttle train railcars, and another $.025 per bushel for each bushel of
grain loaded out of the Elevator to shuttle train railcars and $.03 per bushel
for each bushel loaded out to trucks or non-shuttle train railcars.
Additionally, 100% of the incentive payments to either CTG or ConAgra from
what is commonly known as the Origin Efficiency Program of Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Railroad Company (such company, "Railroad") and 100% of the incentive
payments to either CTG or ConAgra from what is commonly known as
the Railroads Destination Efficiency Program for any grain loaded into the
Elevator from rail or loaded onto rail from the Elevator shall be paid over to
or retained by CTG. With respect to any train re-loading incentive payments
paid by Railroad to either ConAgra or CTG for grain loaded out to railcars at
the Elevator immediately following delivery of grain to the Elevator from such
railcars, all such incentive payments shall be divided equally if both parties
participate in either unloading or loading (i.e., each party hereto either
takes ownership of the grain unloaded from such train or owns some portion of
the grain loaded onto such train) the train. If either ConAgra or CTG unload
and subsequently reload the same unit train (i.e., if all grain unloaded from
the train is purchased by one party hereto and all grain loaded onto such
train is owned by such party), 100% of the re-load incentive will accrue to
the respective party. Accounts will be reconciled and settled at the end of
the month in which either party receives the incentive. Railcars and trucks
shall be unloaded in the order received at the Elevator. CTG shall guarantee
the unloading of up to fifty (50) cars/day with prior approval from CTG in
any seven (7) day period with no demurrage for the account of ConAgra so long
as CTG has an agreement in place with Railroad under which no demurrage is
charged to CTG for trains delivered to the Elevator as long as CTG meets
certain average unloading requirements at the Elevator as set forth in such
agreement. CTG shall receive a five (5) day pre-advice on all inbound billed
non-shuttle railcars to the Elevator. All 110-car shuttle trains must be pre-
approved by CTG and in addition to the incentive payment allocation set forth
above, CTG shall  



 

2  receive all other destination unload incentives. CTG will use commercially
reasonable efforts to accommodate shuttle trains and will not
unreasonably withhold or delay its approval. If ConAgra has obtained CTGs
prior approval for a shuttle train or has given CTG five (5) day pre-advice on
any other train, then demurrage for any such train will be for the account of
CTG. In the event that CTG is unable to take a shuttle train after having
given prior approval or unable to take any other train after five (5) day pre-
advice from ConAgra, then ConAgra shall not be obligated to pay the storage
fee under Section 10 below with respect to the total bushel volume of the
unit train not taken by CTG. CTG shall be responsible for all demurrage
charges in connection with the activities contemplated under this Agreement
except ConAgra shall be responsible for demurrage that occurs prior to the
arrival of ConAgras transportation equipment at the Elevator for delivery of
ConAgra grain.

5.  _Turning, Conditioning, Blending and Transfers_. CTG shall turn and
condition grain within bins and transfer and blend grain between bins as
requested by ConAgra. ConAgra shall select the bins to be used as a result of
the turning, conditioning, blending or transferring of the grain. Turning and
conditioning within bins and transfers and blending between bins shall be
charged at a rate of $.025 per affected bushel for each turn or transfer. CTG
will notify ConAgras appointed contact of grain temperatures and quality
(including a description reasonably acceptable to ConAgra) on a weekly basis.

6.  _Capital Expenditures_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit "C"_ , is a list of
all equipment owned by ConAgra which is located at the Elevator and a list of
all capital expenditure projects currently in progress at the Elevator for
the benefit of ConAgras Saginaw flour mill (the "Projects"). ConAgra shall be
responsible to complete the Projects, and CTG shall provide ConAgra, its
contractors and subcontractors reasonable access to the Elevator in order
to complete the Projects. In addition, during the Initial Term and any
Renewal Term of this Agreement, CTG shall allow ConAgra to undertake any
reasonable capital project at the Elevator for the benefit of ConAgras
Saginaw flour mill, on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the
parties. ConAgra shall be responsible for its contractors and subcontractors
actions while at the Elevator and will instruct its contractors and
subcontractors to observe CTGs written rules and regulations while at the
Elevator.

7\. _Shrinkage on Inventory_. CTG shall be entitled to take a shrink of .25%
on all inbound bushels of grain, without regard to actual shrink, as compared
to the bushels of grain loaded out. Shrink during transport to the Elevator is
handled in accordance with Section 8 below. All inbound shipments of grain
by ConAgra (including all rail/shuttle shipments) shall be settled at the
destination (Elevator) scale. If non-shuttle train grain or truck grain is
purchased on the basis of origin weights, any differential between origin
weights and destination weights shall be for ConAgras account.

8\. _Weights and Grades_. CTG will accept first official certified weights on
all incoming shuttle train grain as defined by the National Grain and Feed
Association trade rules. If ConAgra desires certified weights and grades, an
official inspection and certification will be done by a mutually agreed upon
inspection agency. House standard weighing and certification charges are
included in the unloading charges set forth above. Any cost of official
inspections or certified weights is the responsibility of ConAgra. Charges for
house truck weighing and grading are included in the put through price.
ConAgra shall have the right to use the Elevators truck scale 24 hours per
day, 365 days per year for an annual fixed fee of $2,000.00 per year. In
addition, ConAgra shall have the right to unload trucks of grain at the
Elevator during the same days and hours that CTG unloads trucks of its grain
at the Elevator but in all events, ConAgra shall have the right to unload
trucks of grain at the Elevator during normal business hours, five (5) days
per week and during such extended business hours at the Elevator during
harvest season.



 

3 9\. _Inventory Reports_. CTG shall provide daily inventory bin reports based
upon inbound ConAgra grain received and outbound ConAgra grain transferred
the previous day. In addition, CTG shall provide ConAgra with monthly
inventory reports based upon soundings of the bins in which ConAgras grain is
stored. ConAgra shall pay all taxes and assessments of whatever nature levied
or assessed against ConAgras grain at the Elevator.

10\. _Storage Charges_. Storage charges of $.02 per bushel per month will be
charged to ConAgra for each bushel of storage space at the Elevator reserved
by ConAgra pursuant to the terms of Section 1 above.

11\. _Fumigation_. CTG shall fumigate ConAgras grain as requested by ConAgra
or as determined to be necessary by CTG. Insect infestation control shall be
the responsibility of CTG. Fumigation of ConAgras grain will be charged to
ConAgra at a rate of $.015 per bushel fumigated in addition to terms of
Section 5\. CTG shall notify ConAgra when an insect infestation of ConAgras
grain is occurring.

12\. _Payment._ All amounts due hereunder shall be paid by ConAgra to CTG
within twenty five (25) days following ConAgras receipt of CTGs invoice
therefor. CTG shall invoice ConAgra for payments due hereunder on a monthly
basis in arrears.

13\. _Quality_. ConAgra grain loaded out of the elevator by CTG shall be the
same quality as ConAgra grain when loaded in the elevator.

14\. _Right of First Refusal_. CTG hereby grants to ConAgra the right of first
refusal for any sale contract for grain at the Elevator (each, a "Contract")
into which CTG proposes to enter during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term.
ConAgra shall have four (4) hours after verbal notice from CTG of a proposed
Contract during which ConAgra may exercise its right to enter into the
Contract with CTG. If ConAgra fails to exercise its right to enter into the
Contract within such time period, then CTG shall have the right to enter into
the Contract, provided the right of first refusal will remain in effect for
such subsequent proposed Contracts during the Initial Term or any Renewal
Term.

15\. _Indemnities_.



     | 15.1 |

ConAgra shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless CTG, its parent,
subsidiaries and affiliates and their directors, officers, employees and
agents (collectively, the "CTG Indemnities") from and against any and all
demands, claims, causes of action, damages, losses, liabilities, judgment, and
expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and court

parent, subsidiaries and affiliates and their directors, officers, employees
and agents (collectively, the "ConAgra Indemnities") from and against any and
all Claims to the extent arising from the use, milling, loading, unloading,
storage, transfer, handling or other operation or occupation of the Elevator
by any of the CTG Indemnities or the violation at the Elevator by any of the
CTG Indemnities of any applicable laws, ordinances, or regulations, including
any laws designed to protect human health or the environment, except to the
extent caused by any negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of any
of the ConAgra Indemnities. In connection with the foregoing, CTG agrees to
maintain in force and effect, during the term of this Agreement, commercial
and general liability insurance coverage, including products liability, with
an insurance carrier that maintains an A.M. Best rating of "A" or better,
with ConAgra named as an additional insured for claims arising from CTGs
negligence with minimum limits of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) per

---|---|--- 
16\. _Insurance_.



     | 16.1 | _Insurance on Grain in Storage_. During the term of this
Agreement, CTG agrees that it will maintain an "all risk" property insurance
policy which will extend coverage over "property of others" in its care,
custody and control. The policy limit for this specific coverage item will be
at full replacement value of the grain in the Elevator at the time of loss.
CTG will also maintain automobile liability insurance with a minimum limit of
Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per occurrence, and carry and maintain
workers compensation and employers liability insurance in accordance with
the statutory requirements of the State of Texas. As to any loss or damage to
the Elevator not required to be insured hereunder, CTG shall bear the cost of
repairing the same. CTG shall be deemed to be a self-insurer as to the
deductible, self-insurance retention, or co-insurance applicable to such
insurance coverage and shall pay any such amount applicable in the event of
such loss or damage. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.2 | _General_. The policy or policies of insurance will be
issued by a company or companies licensed in the State of Texas, will provide
that such policy or policies will not be cancelled without the insurance
company first giving ConAgra and CTG prior written notice thereof at least
thirty (30) days before such cancellation shall become effective and shall
contain a waiver of subrogation.  
---|---|--- 

17\. _Elevator Operations._ Without first obtaining ConAgras prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, CTG will not use the
Elevator to support or service any business operation unrelated to grain or
by-product supply located or to be located near or adjacent to the Elevator,
or use its property comprising the Elevator, in any manner which would
materially impact the flour milling operations at Saginaw (e.g., any adverse
impact on sanitation, rodent or pest control; increase in noise, air, smoke or
dust emissions, etc.).



 

5 18\. _Assignment, Sublease, Sale or Mortgage_. This Agreement shall not be
assigned or transferred by either party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto, which consent may be withheld for any
reason. Provided, however, in the event of any assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or change of control of either ConAgras Saginaw, Texas flour
mill or the flour milling division of ConAgra to any third party, then ConAgra
shall have the right to assign this Agreement and its rights hereunder to such
third party without CTGs consent. In addition, in the event of any
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or change of control at either the
Elevator or CTG to any third party, then CTG shall require such third party to
assume this Agreement and all of CTGs obligations hereunder.

19\. _Compliance_.



     | 19.1 | _Sanitation, Inspections, Compliance with Laws_. CTG shall
maintain the entire Elevator in a reasonably sanitary condition including an
ongoing program of reasonable insect and rodent control. CTG shall comply,
and cause the Elevator to comply, with all applicable laws, ordinances, and
regulations. ConAgra may (but shall not in any way or for any reason be
obligated to) make reasonable inspections of the Elevator and any grain
stored therein during normal workday working hours, as reasonably set by CTG.
ConAgra may request information pertaining to the condition of the grain in
storage at the Elevator and information pertaining to handling of such grain
in storage. 
---|---|--- 



     | 19.2 | _Licenses and Bonds_. CTG shall maintain, at its sole cost
and expense, all licenses, bonds and other governmental approvals necessary
for its operations at the Elevator. 
---|---|--- 



     | 19.3 | _Audits_. During the Initial Term and any Renewal Term of
this Agreement, CTG shall provide ConAgra upon prior written notice, the
reasonable right to perform supervised inspections of the Elevator and CTGs
grain storage and handling procedures at the Elevator. If ConAgra reasonably
determines and demonstrates that any of CTGs procedures relating to grain
storage and handling are not in accordance with the flour milling industry
standard, CTG shall take reasonable action at its sole cost to correct its
grain storage and handling procedures. In addition, upon prior written notice
and details of the intended scope of the Elevator inspection, CTG shall grant
supervised access to the Elevator to any relevant third party constituent of
ConAgras flour milling business (e.g., customer, governmental agency,
American Institute of Baking, etc.) to inspect the Elevator and/or
CTGs storage and handling procedure at the Elevator for the grain used in
ConAgras flour milling operation at Saginaw. ConAgra shall share the results
of all such inspections with CTG. CTG and ConAgra agree that the American
Institute of Baking (AIB) Consolidated Standards for Grain Handling
Facilities, as amended from time to time ("AIB Standards"), and the United
States Warehouse Act shall together serve as the basis for determining the
standard of CTGs grain handling and storage practices at the Elevator. In
the event any provision of the foregoing two standards should conflict, then
the United States Warehouse standard shall prevail. CTG agrees to maintain at
the Elevator a minimum AIB rating of 800 (as defined in the AIB Standards)
during the Initial Term and any Renewal Term of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 19.4 |

_Sanitation Boundaries._ ConAgra agrees at its sole expense to provide,
install and maintain barricades that sufficiently restrict access to all
areas immediately beneath the eighteen (18) designated mill bins located in
the Elevators Northeast   

---|---|--- 



 

6  Annex, excluding the Elevators main reclaim belt conveyor. ConAgra is
responsible for all sanitation measures within the aforementioned area,
including the area immediately surrounding the outside bucket elevator legs
feeding the Saginaw flour mill and CTG hereby grants ConAgra with access to
such area, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year to perform all sanitation
procedures. CTG retains the unconditional right of access to the
aforementioned designated area. 

---|--- 



     | 19.5 | _Integrated Pest Management._ The parties agree to utilize
Integrated Pest Management incorporating pheromone traps or similar technology
to track trends of insect levels to establish action levels for control,
including spraying, cleaning, fumigation, fogging and bin cleaning to maintain

     | 19.6 | _ConAgra Equipment._ ConAgra shall be responsible to
maintain, repair and replace all ConAgra owned equipment currently located at
the Elevator, all equipment to be located at the Elevator as a result of any
Project, and any equipment to be located at the Elevator as a result of any
future capital project agreed to by the parties (all such present or future
items of equipment referred to herein as the "Equipment"). CTG hereby grants
ConAgra the right of access 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to that part of
the Elevator where any Equipment is or shall be located. In addition, the
Equipment is connected to and controlled by ConAgras computer system located
at its Saginaw flour mill and CTG hereby agrees at all times under this

activities shall be performed by ConAgra in accordance with all applicable
regulations including, but not limited to, OSHA regulations. 
---|---|--- 

20\. _Damage or Destruction to Premises_. Without affecting any other rights

their respective officers, employees, and agents and waive their entire right
to recover damages against the other, for loss of or damage to its property
arising out of or incident to the perils required to be insured against
herein. If the Elevator or any portion thereof in which ConAgras grain is
stored shall be damaged or destroyed to such an extent that in the opinion of
ConAgra or CTG, the Elevator or the portion of thereof in which ConAgras
grain is stored cannot economically be used for the storage and elevation of
grain, the parties shall cooperate to identify another portion of the
Elevator in which ConAgras grain may be stored until CTG can repair the
damaged bins. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, and CTG
shall proceed with reasonable diligence to repair the damaged bins. If the
parties cannot agree on the other portion of the Elevator to be used (neither
party shall unreasonably object to alternate portions proposed by the other
party) then the parties shall implement the dispute resolution mechanism set
forth in Section 23.9 below.

or removed from title to the Elevator at the time of closing. 

---|---

Elevator to any third party (a "Transaction"), then CTG shall, before
entering into negotiations or agreeing to any Transaction, give written notice
to ConAgra of such Transaction and afford ConAgra the opportunity to make an
offer to purchase the Elevator and CTG shall enter into good faith
negotiations with ConAgra to sell and convey the Elevator to ConAgra. If CTG
and ConAgra shall fail to enter into a written agreement providing for the
sale of the Elevator to ConAgra within ninety (90) days after the date of
CTGs written notice to ConAgra, CTG may thereafter negotiate the Transaction
for a price, and upon terms and conditions which are not materially different
nor materially more favorable to the third party purchaser than those terms
and conditions offered to ConAgra or negotiated by ConAgra and CTG. Prior to
entering into any agreement relating to any Transaction, CTG must first
provide ConAgra not less than thirty (30) days notice in writing that it has
negotiated in principle a Transaction, in either event setting forth the name
and address of the third party, and the price, terms and conditions relating
to the sale of such interest, and ConAgra shall have the right to purchase the
interest in question at the same price and on the same terms and conditions
negotiated with such third party, it being understood that in the event
ConAgra does not give notice of its intention to purchase the interest in
question within said period, this Agreement, and all of its terms and
conditions, including the rights set forth in this Section 22, shall remain in
full force and effect and CTG and any purchaser or purchasers of the interest
in question shall each be bound thereby, and in the event that
the Transaction is not completed for any reason, ConAgra shall have, on the
same condition and notice, the continuing rights set forth in this Section
22\.

_SUBLEASE_

AGREEMENT OF SUBLEASE made this _ _day of  _ _, 2008
by and between CONAGRA FOODS, INC., formerly known as ConAgra, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Sublessor") and _ _, a  _
_("Sublessee").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, pursuant to a Lease Agreement (the "Prime Lease") dated May 20,
1998, as amended by First Addendum thereto dated May 1, 1999 and Second
Amendment thereto dated July 11, 2005, between Opus Estates Corporation
("Prime Landlord") as landlord and Sublessor as tenant, Prime Landlord leased
to Sublessor that certain property described as the Global Trading Building
located at 11 ConAgra Drive, Omaha, Nebraska (the "Building").

WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublease the second floor of the Building from
Sublessor, (the "Subleased Premises").

NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Sublease_. Sublessor hereby subleases to Sublessee, and Sublessee hereby
hires and subleases from Sublessor, on the terms, covenants and conditions
hereinafter provided, the Subleased Premises. The Subleased Premises shall
also include the right to use the furniture ("Furniture") located in the
Subleased Premises. Sublessee is obligated to pay for any replacement or new
furniture, at Sublessors cost. Sublessee shall also be allocated the use of
191 unreserved parking stalls located in the parking lot immediately south of
the Building (including the parking structure in said parking lot), as well as
11 reserved parking stalls located within the Building. The parking stalls
described in this Section 1 may only be used by Sublessee and its officers
and employees. Sublessees business invitees shall be entitled to use the
visitor parking stalls designated in front of the Building. Sublessee,
Sublessees employees and business invitees must comply with all Sublessors
reasonable rules and regulations applicable to any parking facilities, which
rules shall be enforced in a non-discriminatory manner. Sublessee shall also
have the right to purchase, on a monthly basis, the right to use additional
parking stalls located in the south parking lot at the rate of $25.00 per
stall per month, based on availability, Sublessee acknowledging that there is
no guaranty that said additional parking stalls will be available at any time.

2\. _Term_. The initial term (the "Initial Term") of this Sublease shall
commence on  _ _, 2008 (the "Commencement Date") and
shall expire on  _ _, 2010 (the "Termination Date")
unless sooner terminated by reason of or pursuant to any provision set
forth herein or in the Prime Lease. Sublessee shall have the right to renew
the term of this Sublease for two additional terms of one year each by
providing written notice to Sublessor of Sublessees intent to renew, which
notice, to be effective, must be received by Sublessor at least 180 days
prior to the expiration date of the then current Initial Term or first renewal
term (as applicable). Such renewal terms, if validly exercised, shall be on
the same terms and conditions as effective during the Initial Term of this
Lease. Provided, however, Sublessee shall not have the right to exercise the
said renewal options if, at the time of the exercise of said renewal options,
Sublessee is then in default under any of the terms and conditions of this
Sublease which default or defaults have not yet been cured by Sublessee after
written notice and within any applicable grace period (if any). Sublessee shall have the right to terminate this Sublease at any time upon
first providing to Sublessor at least 180 days prior written notice of
Sublessees intent to terminate this Sublease. Sublessor shall have the right
to terminate this Lease at any time upon first providing to Sublessee at least
180 days prior written notice of Sublessors intent to terminate this
Sublease, provided said termination date may only be effective after the
Initial Term.

3\. _Rent_. Sublessee shall pay rent ("Monthly Rent") in equal
monthly installments of $92,112.61 in advance on the 1st day of each and
every month during the term of this Sublease. All rent payments, and any
other payments due hereunder, shall be paid to Sublessor at its address set
forth in Section 22 below. In the event any Monthly Rent payment or any other
payment due under this Sublease is not received within five days after its due
date for any reason whatsoever, in addition to the past due amount, Sublessee
shall pay to Sublessor as a late charge an amount, as additional rent, equal
to 5% of the amount past due in order to compensate Sublessor for its
administrative and other overhead expense, and it is agreed that the amount
thus due shall bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum, such interest to
accrue continuously on any unpaid balance due to Sublessor by Sublessee during
the period commencing on the aforesaid due date and terminating on the date
on which Sublessee makes full payment of all amounts owed to Sublessor.
Monthly Rent or additional rent payable for any partial month shall be
prorated based on the exact number of days in such month.

4\. _Use of Certain Areas_. The parties hereto acknowledge that Sublessor
retains exclusive control and use of that portion of the Building
not included with any Subleased Premises including, but not limited to all
"common areas" in the Building, including lobbies, hallways, elevators and
restrooms, located on the second floor of the Building otherwise included in
the Subleased Premises, for access to and use and enjoyment of all portions
of the Building not otherwise included in the Subleased Premises.

Sublessee and its employees shall, at no cost, be entitled to use the
exercise facility (the "Exercise Facility") located in the Building (but not
within the Subleased Premises) and shall have access to and use of the
Exercise Facility at the same times and on the same terms as made available
to Sublessors employees. Sublessees employees must comply with all of
Sublessors rules and regulations applicable to the Exercise Facility.

Sublessee and its employees shall, at no cost, except as provided in the
following sentence, be entitled to use the learning center located on the
first floor of the Building as the same is available and upon mutually agreed
upon reservation procedures to be established between Sublessor and Sublessee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublessee shall be responsible for paying for
any additional fees concerning the learning center related to catering,
specialized audio-visual requirements and other additional costs which are to
be paid by Sublessee, prior to use, which will be billed to Sublessee at cost.

Sublessor shall allow Sublessees employees and invitees access to Sublessors
cafeterias (the "Cafeterias") located in the Building and in Sublessors
Corporate Building (the "Corporate Building") located at 1 ConAgra Drive and
Sublessees employees shall have access to the Corporate Building by way of
Sublessors tunnel system connecting the Building to the Corporate Building,
subject to Sublessors right to temporarily close all or a portion of said
tunnel system for repair, maintenance, security or emergency. Sublessee and
its employees may also use the Cafeteria for catering and special events as
the same is available and upon mutually agreed upon reservation procedures to
be established between Sublessor and Sublessee. Sublessee shall be responsible
for paying any fees for catering or special event services at the Cafeterias
which are to be paid by Sublessee, prior to use, which will be billed to
Sublessee at cost.



 

2 Sublessor shall allow Sublessees employees access to Sublessors company
store ("Company Store") located at Six ConAgra Drive, Omaha, Nebraska, as
long as the Sublessor continues to operate the Company Store at that location.

Sublessor shall have access to the Subleased Premises twenty-four hours a day,
seven days per week, subject to the provisions of the Prime Lease and
reasonable security rules by Sublessor. When obtaining access to the Building,
Sublessee shall require its employees, officers, agents, invitees and
licensees to comply with the same building and parking security requirements
as required of Sublessors employees, officers, agents, invitees and
licensees, including exhibiting any employee access cards or other
authorizations before being admitted to the Building.

5\. _Use_. The Subleased Premises shall be used for office purposes and
lawful uses ancillary or incidental thereto, and for no other purpose.
Sublessee may not install any vending machines or provide any copy service or
food sales in the Subleased Premises.

6\. _Assignment and Subleasing_. Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease nor
sublet the Subleased Premises in whole or in part, and shall not permit
Sublessees interest in this Sublease to be vested in any third party by
operation of law or otherwise, without first obtaining Sublessors consent,
which consent may be withheld by Sublessor for any reason. Conditioned
upon Sublessee obtaining the Prime Landlords consent to the extent required
by the Prime Lease, Sublessee shall be entitled upon prior written notice to
Sublessor to allow the Subleased Premises, or a portion thereof, to be
occupied by or subleased to an affiliate of Sublessee. Any assignment,
sublease or under grant of rights by Sublessee pursuant to this Section 6
shall relieve Sublessee of liability under this Sublease.

7\. _Prime Lease Costs_. If Sublessor shall be charged for additional rent or
other sums pursuant to the provisions of the Prime Lease, Sublessee shall be
liable for 36.98% (the "Sublessees Percentage") of such additional rent or
sums. If Sublessee shall procure any services from the building or the Prime
Landlord, Sublessee shall pay for the same at the rates charged therefor by
the Prime Landlord and shall make such payment to Sublessor or the Prime
Landlord, as Sublessor shall direct. Sublessor shall provide Sublessee with
copies of Prime Landlords invoice for all charges submitted to Sublessee for
payment pursuant to this Section 7\.

8\. _Operating Costs_.

(a) Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor as additional rent, at the same time
installments of Monthly Rent are due, an amount equal to 1/12th
of Sublessees Percentage of all Operating Expenses. On or before the
Commencement Date and on or after January 1 of each calendar year subsequent
to the Commencement Date, Sublessor will notify Sublessee of Sublessors
estimate of the Operating Expenses payable by Sublessee for the current
calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of said Operating
Expenses are solely attributable to Sublessee, the Subleased Premises or
Sublessees use of the Subleased Premises, Sublessee shall pay all of said
Operating Expenses in full.

(b) As further additional rent, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor, at the
same time installments of Monthly Rent are due, an amount equal to 1/12th of
Sublessees Percentage of all Service Expenses. On or before the Commencement
Date and on or after January 1 of each calendar year subsequent to the
Commencement Date, Sublessor will notify Sublessee of Sublessors estimate of
the Service Expenses payable by Sublessee for the current calendar year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of said Services Expenses are solely
attributable to Sublessee, the Subleased Premises or Sublessees use of the
Subleased Premises, Sublessee shall pay all of said Services Expenses in full
after receipt of an invoice together with reasonable back-up documentation.



 

3 (c) On or after January 1 of each calendar year subsequent to the Commencement
Date, Sublessor will notify (the "Accounting Notice") Sublessee of the amount
of any additional rent due from Sublessee, on account of the difference
between the additional rent paid by Sublessee for the preceding calendar year
and the actual additional rent for the preceding calendar year due pursuant
to Sections 8(a) and (b) herein. Sublessee shall, upon receipt of the
Accounting Notice, pay to Sublessor the balance of the additional rent due
from Sublessee for the preceding calendar year. If Sublessors estimate of
additional rent is more than the actual additional rent for any calendar year
the amount of such excess paid by Sublessee shall be credited against the next
installments of Monthly Rent as they become due. In the event the term of
this Sublease or any extension or renewal hereof ends on a day other than the
last day of a month, the amount of additional rent payable by Sublessee for
such partial month shall be prorated on the basis of a 30 day
month. Notwithstanding that this Sublease has terminated, the amount of any
additional rent due hereunder shall be payable promptly upon receipt of a
statement from Sublessor which shall include copies of back-up documentation
received by Sublessor from the Prime Landlord, and conversely any credit due
Sublessee for any excess additional rent actually paid shall be promptly
refunded after Sublessors calculation thereof, subject to Sublessors right
to apply any credit due Sublessee against any sums due Sublessor hereunder.

(d) "Operating Expenses" shall be defined as the sum of any and all costs,
expenses and disbursements of every kind and character which Sublessor shall
incur, pay or become obligated to pay in any calendar year in connection with
the operation, maintenance, repair and security of the Building and land upon
which the Building is located and all related improvements and appurtenances
thereto and compliance with the terms and conditions of the Prime Lease, which
shall include but not be limited to the following: real estate taxes and
assessments; rent taxes; gross receipts taxes; water and sewer charges;
insurance premiums; license, permit and inspection charges; utilities; service
contracts; labor; management of the Building; air conditioning and heating;
elevator maintenance; supplies; materials; equipment; tools; security;
garbage service; maintenance and upkeep costs of all parking areas, drives,
lawns, trees, shrubbery and common areas; snow removal; and the cost of
contesting by appropriate proceedings increases in real estate taxes and
assessments and the applicability to, or the validity of, any statute,
ordinance, rule or regulation affecting the Building or land which might
increase operating expenses. "Operating Expenses" shall not include: the cost
of capital improvements; expenses for repairs, replacements, and general
maintenance paid by proceeds from insurance; alterations attributable solely
to tenants of the Building other than Sublessee; depreciation; and leasing
commissions.

(e) "Service Expenses" shall be defined as the sum of any and all costs,

Articles 11.1 and 11.2 of the Prime Lease only to the extent applicable to
Sublessees use of the Subleased Premises. In case of any breach hereof by

available to the landlord against the tenant under the Prime Lease if such
breach were by the tenant thereunder after written notice and the expiration
of any applicable grace period provided in the Prime Lease. 

10\. _Insurance_. Sublessee shall carry the same commercial general liability
insurance required under Section 8.2(a) of the Prime Lease which shall be
applicable to this Sublease with the force and effect as if Sublessor were the

property or the personal property of others kept, stored or maintained on the
Subleased Premises, including the Furniture, against loss or damage by fire,

the Prime Lease and subject to Sublessors reasonable approval, Sublessee, at
Sublessees cost, may only erect a sign at the entrance of the Subleased
Premises. Upon request by Sublessee and at Sublessees expense, Sublessor
shall place Sublessees name on the door at main entrance of the Building. No
other signs on the exterior or interior of the Building may be erected by the
Sublessee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 26.1 of the Prime Lease,
Sublessee may not make any alterations or improvements to the
Subleased Premises without first obtaining Sublessors consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and otherwise
complying with the requirements of the Prime Lease. Provided, however,
Sublessee may reconfigure cubicles and furniture located within the Subleased
Premises so long as Sublessee does not permanently modify any such cubicles or
furniture and Prime Landlords consent is not required for such alterations.

Sublessors direction but at Sublessees sole cost, including the cost of
routing or re-routing any electrical, phone or data cables.

to the provisions hereof or the Prime Lease, but not timely taken by Sublessee
which may be necessary to prevent a default under or to assure complete
compliance with the terms of this Sublease or the Prime Lease. All costs and
expenses incurred by Sublessor, including, but not limited to attorneys fees,
for any actions taken pursuant to this Section 13 shall be payable by

statement of any such costs to Sublessee.

acts and omissions of Sublessee.

from and against all claims of any kind whatsoever by reason of any breach or
default of this Sublease on the part of the breaching party or any breach

whatsoever, in addition to complying with Section 27.5 of the Prime Lease,
Sublessee shall also remove all of Sublessees personal property from the
Subleased Premises. The Furniture shall be surrendered to Sublessor at the
termination of this Sublease. Sublessee agrees that time shall be of
the essence with respect to Sublessees obligation to surrender possession of
the Subleased Premises to Sublessor upon the termination of the term of this
Sublease, and further agrees that in the event that Sublessee does not
promptly surrender possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessor upon
such termination, Sublessor, in addition to any other rights and remedies
Sublessor may have against Sublessee for such holding over, shall be entitled
to bring summary proceedings against Sublessee, and Sublessee agrees to

(collectively, "CAG"), has heretofore provided certain corporate and other
services to the CTG Business, and the CTG Business has heretofore provided

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | LLC has requested that CAG continue to provide or cause to
be provided the services described in _Schedule "A"_ (the "CAG Services") to
the CTG Business, and CAG has requested that LLC continue to provide or cause
to be provided the services described in _Schedule "B"_ (the "LLC Services")
to CAG. The CAG Services and LLC Services, together with other services
identified in the body of this Agreement are collectively referred to herein
as the "Services." 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The parties are willing to enter into this Agreement and to
provide or cause to be provided the Services upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.  
---|---|--- 

_AGREEMENT:_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals which are
incorporated with and made a part of this Agreement, and in further
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties agree as follows:

1\. _Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein: (i) CAG
agrees to provide or cause to be provided the CAG Services to the CTG
Business in a manner consistent with the manner in which the CAG Services have
historically been provided to the CTG Business; and (ii) LLC agrees to provide
or cause to be provided the LLC Services to CAG in a manner consistent
with the manner in which the LLC Services have historically been provided to
CAG.

2\. _Term_. The CAG Services shall be provided for the periods set forth on
_Schedule "A"_ or otherwise in the Agreement, provided LLC shall have the
right to terminate one or more of the CAG Services by providing CAG with
written notice of such termination as specified under "Required Notice for
Early Termination" in _Schedule "A"_ or otherwise in the Agreement. The LLC
Services shall be provided for the periods set forth on _Schedule "B"_ or
otherwise in the Agreement, provided CAG shall have the right to terminate
one or more of the LLC Services by providing LLC with written notice of such
termination as specified under "Required Notice for Early Termination" on
_Schedule "B"_ or otherwise in this Agreement. Any extension to the term of
any Service hereunder shall require the prior written agreement of CAG and
LLC. 3\. _Consideration_.

hereunder: 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.1.1 | LLC shall pay CAG the fees set forth on _Schedule "A"_
(the "CAG Fees"), and CAG shall pay LLC the fees set forth on _Schedule "B"_
(the "LLC Fees"). 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.1.2 | Each party shall pay the other any third-party fees and
charges (including consent fees) incurred by the other party in connection
with performance of the Services, including any special or one-time set-up,
separation, transfer, service or other fees required to provide the Services,
and any amounts required to be paid to any licensors of software or any third
party providers of any goods or services that are used by the CTG Business or
otherwise in connection with the provision of any Services hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence and except as set forth on _Schedule
"A"_ for Services related to taxes, neither party shall incur any
individual third-party fee or charge (including consent fees but excluding a
payment obligation associated with an individual participants or
beneficiarys benefits under a CAG Health and Welfare Benefit Plan (as such
term is defined in Section 4 of this Agreement)) in excess of $25,000 without
first obtaining the other partys consent (the "Prior Consent"). At the time
Prior Consent is sought, the party seeking consent must advise the other party

continuation of the Service directly related to the Prior Consent (a
"Dependent Service"). If Prior Consent is denied, the party seeking consent is
entitled to terminate the Service directly related to the Prior Consent and

     | 3.1.3 | Each party shall pay the other for all sales, use or

next business day. 

---|---|--- 



     | 3.2.2 | Pass-through costs (i.e., third-party fees and charges
paid on behalf of the other party) will be paid in cash in advance to the
party remitting payment to the third-party. Such advance payments shall be
made pursuant to procedures to be mutually agreed upon between the parties. 
---|---|--- each party shall make payment of all amounts due to the other party hereunder
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an invoice from the other
party. All payments shall be made by ACH or wire transfer. A late payment
charge equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month shall be paid on all
amounts due but not received on or before the due date. Neither party shall
be entitled to any pro-ration of monthly fees for Services which are
terminated hereunder and which are performed for a partial month.

days after the date hereof and the date replacement documents are obtained by
LLC. Any accident, incident, liability or claim arising from operation of
vehicles of the CTG Business after Closing will be the responsibility of the
LLC, regardless of license and registration.

6\. _Cooperation_. Each party shall cooperate fully with the party performing
the Services by promptly providing all information reasonably requested by the
party performing the Services in connection with the performance of the
Services. Subject to Section 3.1.2, the party performing the Services

be required from licensors or other third parties in order to provide any of

otherwise) to any third party.

7\. _Enterprise Procurement_.

effect immediately prior to such adjustment, and (b) dividing the product
thereof by the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.

5.2  _Reorganizations; Reclassifications; Dividends_.

(a) In case the Company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding Units
into a greater number of Units, the Warrant Amount in effect immediately prior
to such subdivision shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in
case the outstanding number of Units of the Company shall be combined into a
smaller number of Units, the Warrant Amount in effect immediately prior to
such combination shall be proportionately decreased.

(b) At any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant and prior to the
exercise thereof, if the Company makes a distribution of securities of the
Company to its members (the " _Dividend_ "), then the Holder shall be
entitled, upon the exercise hereof, to receive, in addition to the Units it
is entitled to receive, the same kind and amount of securities as would have
been distributed to it in the Dividend had it been the holder of record of the

(a) _Special Definitions_. For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, the
following definitions shall apply:

(i) " _Option_ " shall mean rights, options or warrants to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire Units or Convertible Securities.



 

\- 6 - (ii) " _Convertible Securities_ " shall mean any evidences of indebtedness,
units, membership interests or other securities, in each case, directly or

(iii) " _Additional Units_ " shall mean all Units, all equity securities of
the Company ranking _pari passu_ with or bearing substantially the same
economic substance as the Units, Units actually issued upon the exercise, or
deemed (for purposes hereof to have the meaning in _Section 5.3(d)(iv)_
hereof) issued upon the deemed exercise, of Options and Units actually issued
upon the conversion or exchange, or deemed issued upon the deemed conversion
or exchange, of Convertible Securities issued by the Company after the
Warrant Issue Date, other than the following (" _Exempted Securities_ "):

(A) Units issued or issuable by reason of a dividend, Unit split, split-up or
other distribution on Units (which are addressed by _Section 5.2(b)_ hereof);

(B) Units, Options or Convertible Securities issued or deemed issued to
employees or directors of, or consultants to, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries pursuant to a plan, agreement or arrangement approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company;

(C) Convertible Securities or Options issued; or

(D) Units issued or issuable to banks, equipment lessors or other financial
institutions, or to real property lessors, pursuant to a debt financing,
equipment leasing or real property leasing transaction approved by the Board
of Directors of the Company.

(b) _No Adjustment of Exercise Price_. No adjustment in the Exercise Price
shall be made as the result of the issuance of Additional Units if the
consideration per Unit (determined pursuant to _Subsection 5.3(d)_ ) for such
Additional Units issued by the Company is equal to or greater than the Fair
Market Value at the time of issuance of such Additional Units.

(c) _Adjustment of Exercise Price Upon Issuance of Additional Units_. In the
event the Company shall at any time after the Warrant Issue Date issue
Additional Units, without consideration or for a consideration or deemed
consideration (in either case, determined pursuant to _Subsection 5.3(d)_ )
per Unit less than the Fair Market Value, then the Exercise Price shall
be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the
nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following
formula:

CP2 = CP1 * (A + B) / (A + C)

For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:



 

\- 7 - (A) CP2 shall mean the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such issue
of Additional Units.

(B) CP1 shall mean the Exercise Price effective immediately prior to such
issue of Additional Units.

(C) " _A_ " shall mean the number of Units outstanding and deemed outstanding
immediately prior to such issue of Additional Units (on a fully-diluted
basis);

(D) " _B_ " shall mean the number of Units that would have been issued if
such Additional Units had been issued at a price per Additional Unit equal to
the then Fair Market Value of such Additional Units; and

(E) " _C_ " shall mean the number of such Additional Units issued in such
transaction.

(d) _Determination of Consideration_. For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, the
consideration received by the Company for the issue of any Additional Units
shall be computed as follows:

(i) _Cash and Property_ : Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of
cash received by the Company, including amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the
Fair Market Value thereof at the time of such issue; and

(C) in the event Additional Units are issued together with other units,
membership interests or securities or other assets of the Company for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so
received, computed as provided in _clauses (A) and (B)_ above and allocated
in proportion to the Fair Market Value of each of the Additional Units, other
units, membership interests or securities or other assets of the Company
provided by the Company in exchange for such consideration.

(ii) _Multiple Closing Dates_. In the event the Company shall issue on more
than one date Additional Units that are a part of one transaction or a series
of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the
Exercise Price pursuant to the terms of _Subsection 5.3(c)_ above, and such
issuance dates occur within a period of no more than 60 days from the first
such issuance to the final such issuance, then, upon the final such issuance,
the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances
as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without
additionally giving effect to any adjustments as a result of any subsequent
issuance within such period).



 

\- 8 - (iii) _Deemed Consideration for Options and Convertible Securities_. Upon the
exercise or conversion of Options or Convertible Securities, the
consideration received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the sum
of (A) any consideration actually received in connection with the issuance of
such Options or Convertible Securities (determined pursuant to this
_Subsection 5.3(d)_ ) and (B) the exercise price of such Options or the
conversion or exchange price of such Convertible Securities, as applicable. In
the case of the issuance of Options exercisable for Convertible Securities,
the consideration received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the
sum in the immediately preceding sentence, _plus_ , the conversion or exchange
price of such Convertible Security.

(iv) _Deemed Exercise of Options and Deemed Conversion or Exchange of
Convertible Securities_. If in connection with a Drag/Tag Transaction or
a Reorganization, Options or Convertible Securities are returned to the
Company, cancelled or otherwise terminated in exchange for consideration
(other than Units upon exercise or conversion, which is addressed by
_Subsection 5.3(d)(iii)_ ), such Options or Convertible Securities shall be
deemed to have been exercised or converted or exchanged, respectively, and the
consideration received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the sum
of (A) any consideration actually received in connection with the issuance of
such Options or Convertible Securities (determined pursuant to this
_Subsection 5.3(d)_ ) and (B) the exercise price of such Options or the
conversion or exchange price of such Convertible Securities, as applicable.
In the case of the return, cancellation or termination of Options exercisable
for Convertible Securities, the consideration received by the Company shall be
deemed to be equal to the sum in the immediately preceding sentence,  _plus_
, the conversion or exchange price of such Convertible Security.

5.4 _Certificate as to Adjustments_. Whenever the Exercise Price shall be
adjusted as provided in this Article V, the Company shall promptly compute
such adjustment and furnish the Holder hereof a certificate setting forth such
adjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring
such adjustment, and the Exercise Price and Warrant Amount that will be
effective after such adjustment.

ARTICLE VI

TAG-ALONG, DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS

6.1  _Tag-Along Rights_.

(a) No transaction or proposed transaction (or series of related transactions)
that would result, directly or indirectly, in the transfer, sale, exchange,
or other disposition of more than fifty percent (50%) of Units outstanding to
a single Independent Third Party shall be made, closed, effected or registered
on the books or records of the Company, and the Company shall not participate
in any manner whatsoever, facilitate the negotiation or closing of, or execute
any documents related to, such a transaction, unless the proposed transferee
provides to the Holder an irrevocable written offer to purchase (" _Proposed
Transferee s Offer_") from the Holder a number of Units issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant equal to the Tag-Along Amount, or such lesser amount
as the Holder may agree.



 

\- 9 - (b) The " _Tag-Along Amount_ " shall mean, with respect to the Holder,
an amount of Units bearing a proportion to the Units represented by this
Warrant that is equal to the proportion that all of the Units being sold in
the transaction giving rise to the Proposed Transferees Offer bear to the
total number of issued and outstanding Units of the Company.

(c) The Proposed Transferees Offer shall be made on the same terms
and conditions as those offered to Members holding Units, including the same
price per Unit; provided that such terms and conditions shall not require the
Holder to (i) agree to any non-competition restrictions, or (ii) provide
any indemnification other than on a _pro rata_ basis.

(d) The Holder shall have twenty (20) days from the receipt of the Proposed
Transferees Offer in which to accept such Proposed Transferees Offer. If the
Holder accepts the Proposed Transferees Offer, the Holder shall exercise a
portion of this Warrant representing the number of Units to be purchased
pursuant to Proposed Transferees Offer based on an Exercise Price as adjusted
(with respect to only the Units for which this Warrant is being exercised in
connection with such Proposed Transferees Offer) pursuant to  _Section 6.3_
hereof. Such exercise and the closing of the sale of the Holders Units
pursuant to the Proposed Transferees Offer shall take place simultaneously
with the consummation of the transaction giving rise to the Proposed
Transferees Offer. If the Holder rejects such Proposed Transferees Offer,
then, for a period of ninety (90) days following such rejection, the proposed
transferee may effect the transaction giving rise to the
Proposed Transferees Offer on terms and conditions, including the price per
Unit, no more favorable than were offered to Holder in the Proposed
Transferees Offer.

6.2 _Drag-Along Rights_. If the Company or Holders of a majority of the Units
outstanding approve and/or initiate a Drag Transaction, then the Company shall
provide written notice of such Drag Transaction to Holder at least ten (10)
days in advance of the closing thereof and Holder agrees to exercise this
Warrant in its entirety and sell the Units received as a result of such
exercise on the terms and conditions approved by the Company and/or
its Members; _provided_ , _that_

(a) upon the consummation of such sale of the Units, all of the Members
(including, upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this _Section 6.2_,
the Holder) shall receive the same form and amount of consideration in
proportion to their respective Units;

(b) the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall be
deemed to occur simultaneously with the Closing of the Drag Transaction, and
the Holder shall pay the Exercise Price (as adjusted pursuant to _Section
6.3_ hereof) by reducing the consideration to be received in respect of the
Units by such Exercise Price (but only after reducing such Exercise Price
pursuant to _Section 3.2_ hereof, if applicable); and



 

\- 10 - (c) the terms and conditions of the Drag Transaction shall not require the
Holder to (i) agree to any non-competition restrictions, or (ii) provide any
indemnification other than on a pro rata basis.

6.3  _Adjustment to Exercise Price_. In the event of a transaction described
in _Section 6.1_, _6.2_ or _6.5_ hereof (" _Drag/Tag Transaction_ "), then
the Exercise Price shall be the lesser of (a) the then current Exercise
Price, or (b) the Exercise Price as calculated below:

(i) If the Drag/Tag Transaction occurs on the first anniversary of the
Warrant Issue Date, the Exercise Price shall be the Entry Price multiplied by
1.4;

(ii) If the Drag/Tag Transaction occurs on the second anniversary of the
Warrant Issue Date, the Exercise Price shall be the Entry Price multiplied by
1.6;

(iii) If the Drag/Tag Transaction occurs on the third anniversary of the
Warrant Issue Date, the Exercise price shall be the Entry Price multiplied by
1.8; and

(iv) If the Drag/Tag Transaction occurs on the fourth anniversary of the
Warrant Issue Date, the Exercise Price shall be the Entry Price multiplied by
2.0;

_provided, however_ , that in the event the Drag/Tag Transaction occurs on a
date other than an anniversary of the Warrant Issue Date as set forth above,
the Exercise Price shall equal the result of the following calculation:

(A) the Entry Price, multiplied by:

(B) the sum of:

(1) the multiplier set forth in this _Section 6.3_ with respect to
the anniversary date immediately preceding such Drag/Tag Transaction (or one
if the Drag/Tag Transaction is prior to the first anniversary of the Warrant
Issue Date), plus

(2) 0.2, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
since the most recent anniversary date (or the Warrant Issue Date, as
applicable) and the denominator of which is 365.

6.4 _Corporate Reorganization_. If the holders of a majority of the Units
cause the Company to incorporate the Company, including by (i) the transfer
of all of the assets of the Company, subject to the Companys liabilities, to
a newly-formed corporation in exchange for shares of such corporation and the
subsequent distribution of such shares to the holders of the Units on a
pro rata basis, (ii) conversion of the Company into a corporation pursuant to
6 Del. C. §18-216 (or any successor section thereto) or (iii) Transfer of
Units to a newly formed corporation in exchange for shares of such
corporation (including by merger of the Company into a corporation) (any
transaction of a kind described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a "
_Reorganization_ "), (a) this Warrant shall remain outstanding and shall be
exercisable for securities of the successor or surviving company (the "
_Corporation_ ") of the type or class received by the holders of Units in
connection with such Reorganization and (b) the Warrant  



 

\- 11 -  Amount shall be adjusted by multiplying the Warrant Amount immediately prior
to such Reorganization by the number of securities issued in respect of
each Unit in connection with such Reorganization. In connection with any such
Reorganization , the holders of a particular class of securities of the
Company shall receive the same form of securities and the same amount of
securities per unit of such class and if any holders of a class of securities
of the Company are given an option as to the form and amount of securities to
be received, each holder of such class of securities shall be given the same
option. The Holder shall not be liable for any organizational, legal or
accounting expenses or filing fees incurred in connection with such
incorporation transaction.

6.5 _Initial Public Offering_. If following a Reorganization, the Corporation
notifies the Holder that it intends to sell shares in a firm underwritten
public offering (an " _IPO_ "), the Holder agrees to the exercise of this
Warrant in full in connection with such IPO, automatically and without
further action by the Holder. The exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO to which it relates, and the Holder shall pay the Exercise Price (as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 6.3_ hereof) pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_
hereof (but only after reducing such Exercise Price pursuant to _Section 3.2_
hereof, if applicable); provided that if any of the securities held by the
Holder as a result of the exercise of the Warrant are to be sold in the IPO,
then the Exercise Price with respect to such securities may be paid by
reducing the consideration, if any, to be received by the Holder in respect
of such securities being sold in connection with such IPO and remitting the
amount of such Exercise Price to the Company.

6.6 _Affiliate Transfers_. For the avoidance of doubt, any direct or indirect
Transfers of Units to a Person who is not an Independent Third Party shall not
trigger any tag-along or drag-along rights.

any distribution thereof, and the Holder has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. The Holder

offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations the Warrant and
the Units issuable upon exercise of this Warrant may be resold without
registration under the Acts only in certain limited circumstances. The Holder
acknowledges that the Warrant and the Units issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the

permit limited resale of securities purchased in a private placement subject
to satisfaction of certain conditions.

Gentlemen:

This letter agreement shall memorialize the parties agreement with respect to
the matters set forth herein. Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Agreement.

For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date the following terms and
conditions shall apply:

A. _Dried Dairy Products_

"Dried Dairy Products" include but are not limited toNonfat Dry Milk (NFDM),
Skim Milk Powder (SMP), Dry Sweet Whey Powder (Whey), Buttermilk Powder,
Lactose, Milk Protein Concentrate (MPC), Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC),
Casein, Caseinate, Deproteinized Whey or Whey Permeate (DPW), Cream Powder,
Whole Milk Powder, or any derivation of the above.

At times, ConAgra Trade Group, Inc. ("CTG") desires to enter into a
cash/physical flat priced Dried Dairy Products position. As CTG works
to secure this physical position, CTG will offer CFFIC d/b/a JM Swank Co.
("Swank") the first right of refusal to participate in any portion of the
business. Competitive bids and offers will be provided by both parties based
on the prevailing market conditions.

As CTG works to exit a cash/physical Dried Dairy Products position, CTG may
try and secure an index / basis contract. CTG will offer Swank first right of
refusal to participate in any portion of these types of contracts. Competitive
bids and offers will be provided based on the prevailing market conditions.

Swank is the preferred vendor for these transactions to CTG.



 

-1- B. _Risk Management/Financial Contracts_

At times, Swank may desire to acquire a derivatives position in the Dried
Dairy Products markets. These types of contracts include, but are not
limited to, Futures, Options, and OTC Swaps. Swank shall offer CTG first
right of refusal to participate in any portion of these types of contracts
within the Dried Dairy Products markets. All costs of Swank entering into
these types of contracts themselves shall be weighed against CTGs best price
for the contract. These costs include, but are not limited to, transaction
fees, mark to market implications, documentation cost, settlement cost. CTG is
the preferred vendor for these types of transactions to Swank.

CTG will market risk management for dry dairy products to third parties. In
the event the third party desires to have risk management incorporated into
physical Dried Dairy Products deliveries, CTG will offer Swank first right of
refusal to participate in any portion of the business. Swank is the preferred
vendor for these types of transactions to CTG.

In any of the above scenarios (A-B), when potential transactions are
presented, the following procedures must be followed: 



     | 1. | The process begins when the sending party (sending/sender)
submits a bid to buy, or offer to sell to the receiving party
(receiving/receiver); and 
---|---|--- 


     | 2. | The receiving party has four (4) business hours to provide
one the following three responses to the sending party on any portion of the
proposed transaction: (a) accept; (b) decline; or (c) counter offer. No
response within the four (4) business hour period will be deemed to be a
declined response by the party. 
---|---|--- 
_Accept_ \- The parties will confirm the transaction and the stated
transaction terms will apply.

_Decline_ \- The receiving party releases the sender of any obligation to
continue pursuing the declined transaction with the receiving party. 

_Counter Offer_ \- The receiving party may provide a counter offer to the
initial bid or offer price. At this time the party who received the counter
offer has two (2) business hours to accept or decline the counter offer.
During the two hour window the party who received the counter offer shall not
confirm the transaction with an outside party at a price and other material
terms and conditions less favorable to such receiving party than the price and
other material terms and conditions contained in the counter offer. The party
who received the counter offer is allowed to confirm the business at a price
and other material terms and conditions more favorable to such receiving
party than the price and other material terms and conditions contained in the
counter offer, provided the party who received the counter offer informs the
party who proposed the counter offer of the details (price, volume, basis,
etc) of the completed transaction unless such party is precluded from
disclosing such information due to its confidentiality obligations with the
third party.

This letter constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, oral and written, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement may not be modified or
amended except by instrument or instruments in writing, signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought.



 

-2- This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of  _ _ applicable to contracts
made and performed in  _ _ (without regard to conflicts
of law doctrines).

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please indicate your agreement to
the matters contained herein by executing this letter agreement
where indicated below and returning it to the undersigned.
