                                   ARTICLE I

                                   The Merger

   SECTION 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

   SECTION 1.02 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable and in no
event later than the second business day following the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (or such other
date as may be agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto), the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The term "Effective Time" means the date
and time of the filing with, and the acceptance by, the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger (or such later time, not to
exceed 30 days after such acceptance for record, as may be agreed in writing by
each of the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger).
Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, a closing (the
"Closing") will be held at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve
Franklin & Hachigian, LLP ("Gunderson Dettmer"), 155 Constitution Drive, Menlo
Park, California 94025 (or such other place as the parties hereto may agree).
The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date."

   SECTION 1.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

   SECTION 1.04 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

   (a) At the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the same as the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that Article I of the amended and restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, instead of reading the same as the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub shall read as follows: The name of
the corporation is Agile Software Corporation.

   (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, subject to Section 6.06(a) of
this Agreement, be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such Bylaws.

   SECTION 1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of

                                   ARTICLE II

               Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates

   SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities.

   (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:

     (i) Each share of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per
  share (the "Company Common Stock") (all issued and outstanding shares of
  Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
  "Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
  (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii))
  shall be converted, subject to Section 2.02(e), into the right to receive
  that number of shares of Common Stock of Parent, par value $0.002 per share
  ("Parent Common Shares") equal to 1.35 (the "Exchange Ratio"). At the
  Effective Time, each such Share shall be canceled, cease to be outstanding
  and cease to exist and each holder of Shares shall thereafter cease to have
  any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive,
  without interest, Parent Common Shares in accordance with this Section
  2.01(a)(i) and cash for fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with
  Section 2.02(e).

     (ii) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned
  by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of
  the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
  extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution
  shall be made with respect thereto.

     (iii) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger
  Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
  converted into and exchanged for one duly authorized, validly issued, fully
  paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
  of the Surviving Corporation.

   (b) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Parent Common Shares or outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class,
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or any similar
event, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent
appropriate to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event.

   (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company, then (i) the Parent Common
Shares issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be
unvested and/or subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition, (ii) the certificates representing such Parent Common Shares
may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends and (iii) the Company shall
take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

   SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates.

   (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with Bank Boston, N.A., or such other bank or trust company that may be
designated by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 as of the
Effective Time and cash, from time to time as required to make payments in lieu
of

                                      A-3
<PAGE>

any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (such cash and certificates
for Parent Common Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent
Common Shares contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.02(f) hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing Parent Common Shares and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing that number of whole Parent Common Shares that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate (after taking into account all Shares then held by such holder),
cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Common
Shares, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation that any applicable share transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the certificate representing Parent Common Shares,
cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).

   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to the Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the Parent Common Shares represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
any fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.02(e), until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate
as provided in Section 2.02(b). Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other
applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.05(a)), following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional
Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and theretofore payable with respect to such whole
Parent Common Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable
with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares.

   (d) No Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All Parent Common Shares
issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof and
any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.02(c) or (e) shall be deemed to have been
issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

   (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the

                                      A-4
<PAGE>

owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each
holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional
share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional
share interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii)
the average closing price per share of Parent Common Shares for the ten most
recent days that Parent Common Shares have traded ending on (and including) the
trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on The Nasdaq
National Market. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests,
the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount
with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments
to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with
the terms of Sections 2.02(b) and (c).

   (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent for the Parent Common Shares, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent
Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c). Any
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a
date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

   (g) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any Parent Common Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

   (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

   (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate and the payment of any fee charged
by the Exchange Agent for such service, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent Common
Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c).

   SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books.

   (a) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent
for any reason shall be converted into Parent Common Shares, any cash in lieu
of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).

                                      A-5
<PAGE>

   (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Certificates
surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an Affiliate (as defined in
Section 6.08 below) shall not be exchanged until Parent shall have received
from such person an affiliate letter as provided in Section 6.08.

   SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options.

   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume (i) all options to acquire
Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Options") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable and whether or not
vested, under the Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan (the "Company 1995 Plan"),
the 1995 Stock Plan of Digital Market, Inc. (the "DMI 1995 Plan"), the
Company's 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the "2000 Plan" and together
with the Company 1995 Plan and the DMI 1995 Plan, the "Company Stock Option
Plans"), and (ii) each Company Stock Option Plan, and the Company's repurchase
right with respect to any unvested shares acquired by the exercise of Company
Stock Options shall be assigned to Parent by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the Company or the holders of such unvested
shares. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such
option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company
Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with
its terms) for that number of whole Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the exercise
price per share of such Company Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as
so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest full cent). It is the
intention of the parties that each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent shall
qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under section 422 of the Code
and to the extent such option qualified as an incentive stock option prior to
the Effective Time. Outstanding purchase rights under the Company's 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company Purchase Plan") shall be exercised
upon the earlier of (i) the next scheduled purchase date under the Company
Purchase Plan or (ii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
participant in the Company Purchase Plan shall accordingly be issued shares of
Company Common Stock at that time pursuant to the terms of the Company Purchase
Plan and each share of Company Common Stock so issued shall by virtue of the
Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section
2.01(a)(i) and cash for fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with
Section 2.02(e). The Company Purchase Plan shall be terminated as of the
Effective Time.

   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of an
outstanding Company Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth such
holder's rights pursuant thereto. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in any event not later than 20 business days following the Effective
Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
or other appropriate forms) that will register the Parent Common Shares subject
to Company Stock Options to the extent permitted by federal securities laws and
shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements for so long as such options
remain outstanding. In addition, Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Parent Common Shares subject to Company Stock Options to be listed on
The Nasdaq National Market and such exchanges as Parent shall determine.

   SECTION 2.05 Warrants. At the Effective Time, each warrant to acquire
Company Common Stock (the "Warrants") granted and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether contingent or earned, that does not terminate by
its terms at or prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a warrant
to acquire Parent Common Shares, and each Warrant so converted will continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Warrant will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole

                                      A-6
<PAGE>

Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon exercise of
such assumed Warrant will be equal to the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as
so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest whole cent).

                                  ARTICLE III

                 Representations and Warranties of the Company

   The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger
Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged according to
specific sections in this Article III and shall provide exceptions to, or
otherwise qualify in reasonable detail, only the corresponding section in this
Article III and any other section in this Article III where it is reasonably
clear, upon a reading of such disclosure without any independent knowledge on
the part of the reader regarding the matter disclosed, that the disclosure is
intended to apply to such other section.

   SECTION 3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

   (a) Section 3.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each of the Company and each
subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries"). Each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
such incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to have such governmental approvals have not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or organization to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth each jurisdiction in which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation or organization.
The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any changes in or effects on
the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, individually or in
the aggregate, are or are substantially likely to be materially adverse to the
business, financial condition, assets (tangible or intangible), liabilities
(including contingent liabilities) or results of operations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for any such changes or
effects principally resulting from or principally arising in connection with
(i) any changes affecting the respective industries in which the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries operate that do not have a disproportionate impact on
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any changes in
general economic conditions that do not disproportionately impact the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) in and of itself, any
change in the trading price of Company Common Stock, (iv) in and of itself, a
failure by Company to meet the revenue or earnings predictions of equity
analysts for any period ending (or for which earnings are released) on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (v) the taking of any
action expressly required by the terms of this Agreement or (vi) any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development to the extent
primarily attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger; provided,
however, that the Company shall bear the burden of showing that such change,
effect, event, occurrence, state of fact or development which the Company
claims does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect is primarily
attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger.

                                      A-7
<PAGE>

   (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly
owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity that is or could reasonably be expected to
be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

   SECTION 3.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
Certificates of Incorporation, Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents)
and minute books of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries, each as
amended to the date of this Agreement. Such Certificates of Incorporation and
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) are in full force and effect.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of the
provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents). The minute books of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are complete and accurate and have been duly maintained in
accordance with all applicable legal requirements, and all signatures appearing
on all documents contained therein are the true signatures of the persons
purported to have signed the same.

   SECTION 3.03 Capitalization.

   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof,
(i) 47,220,810 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and outstanding, all
of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
(ii) no shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock are held in
the treasury of the Company, (iii) no shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock are held by Company Subsidiaries and (iv) no shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of stock or
other equity interest of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share or other equity
interest owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary is free and clear
of all liens, security interests, claims, pledges, options, rights of first
refusal, agreements, limitations on voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. The Company directly owns 100% of the
issued and outstanding capital stock, and all options or other rights to
acquire such capital stock, of each Company Subsidiary.

   (b) The Company has duly reserved 11,750,000 shares of Company Common Stock
for future issuance pursuant to the Company 1995 Plan, of which options to
purchase 4,605,895 shares of Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement, 111,986 shares of Company Common Stock for future
issuance pursuant to the DMI 1995 Plan, of which options to purchase 43,069
shares of Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement, 9,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock for future issuance
pursuant to the 2000 Plan, of which options to purchase 8,151,816 shares of
Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, and
2,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance to employees pursuant to
the Company Purchase Plan, of which 1,809,875 shares are available for
issuance. Section 3.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately sets
forth with respect to each Company Stock Option that is outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement: (i) the name of the holder of such Company Stock
Option; (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that was
originally subject to such Company Stock Option, (iii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that remain subject to such Company Stock Option; (iv) the
date on which such Company Stock Option was granted, (v) the term of such
Company Stock Option; (vi) the vesting schedule for such Company Stock Option;
(vii) the vesting commencement date for such Company Stock Option; (viii) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock purchasable under such Company
Stock Option; (ix) whether such Company Stock Option has been designated an
"incentive stock option" as defined in section 422 of the Code; and (x) the
current employee or independent contractor status of the holder of such Company
Stock Option. No Company Stock Option will by its terms require an adjustment
in connection with the Merger, except as contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
nor any action taken or to be taken by Company in connection with such
transactions, will result in (i) any acceleration of exercisability or vesting
(including, without limiting the foregoing, any right to acceleration of
vesting that is contingent upon

                                      A-8
<PAGE>

the occurrence of a subsequent event) in favor of any optionee under any
Company Stock Option; (ii) any additional benefits for any optionee under any
Company Stock Option; or (iii) the inability of Parent after the Effective Time
to exercise any right or benefit held by the Company prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any Company Stock Option assumed by Parent or any shares
of Company Common Stock previously issued upon exercise of a Company Stock
Option, including, without limitation, the right to repurchase an optionee's
unvested shares on termination of such optionee's employment. The assumption by
Parent of the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Stock Options in
accordance with Section 2.04 hereunder will not give rise to any event
described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

   (c) The Company has duly reserved 50,000 shares of Company Common Stock for
future issuance pursuant to the exercise of Warrants. Section 3.03(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with respect to each Warrant issued to
any person: (i) the name of the holder of such Warrant; (ii) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Warrant; (iii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such
Warrant is immediately exercisable; (iv) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Warrant; (v) whether such Warrant is
subject to vesting and, if so, the conditions of such vesting; and (vi) the
term of such Warrant.

   (d) Except (i) as set forth in Sections 3.03(b) and 3.03(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) for shares of Company Common Stock reserved for
issuance under the Company Purchase Plan and (iii) as provided in the Company
Stock Option Agreement, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of
its capital stock or other equity interests. All shares of Company Common Stock
so subject to issuance, upon issuance in accordance with the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Each holder of a Company Stock Option or
Warrant has been or will be given, or shall have properly waived, any required
notice of the Merger prior thereto, and all such rights of notice will
terminate at or prior to the Effective Time.

   (e) All of the securities sold or issued by the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have been sold or issued in compliance with the requirements of the
federal securities laws and any other applicable securities laws.

   (f) The Company has never repurchased, redeemed or otherwise reacquired any
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any Subsidiary,
other than unvested securities upon termination of employment or consultancy.

   (g) There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements
or understandings to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or
of which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is aware, (i) relating to
voting, registration or disposition of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) granting to any person or group of
persons the right to elect, or to designate or nominate for election, a
director to the board of directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; or
(iii) granting to any person or group of persons information rights.

   (h) The Company has duly reserved 9,396,941 shares of Company Common Stock
for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Option Agreement.

   SECTION 3.04 Authority Relative to This Agreement. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Company Stock Option Agreement, and, subject to obtaining the necessary
approvals of the Company's stockholders, to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the Company Stock Option Agreement by the Company and the

                                      A-9
<PAGE>

consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Company Stock
Option Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions so

this Agreement by the Company's stockholders by the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the votes entitled to vote on the matter (the "Company
Stockholders' Vote"), and the filing and acceptance of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement and the Company Stock Option
Agreement have been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms,
except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
(including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

   SECTION 3.05 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

   (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company Stock
Option Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement
and the Company Stock Option Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or
any equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions
described in Section 3.05(b) have been obtained and all filings and obligations
described in Section 3.05(b) have been made or complied with, conflict with or
violate any foreign or domestic (federal, state or local) law, statute,
ordinance, writ, rule, regulation, order, injunction, judgment or decree
("Law") applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (iii) conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or require any payment under, or result in the
creation of a lien, claim, security interest or other charge or encumbrance on
any material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any material asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected.

   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company Stock
Option Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement
and the Company Stock Option Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, order, authorization, registration or permit of, or filing
with or notification to, any domestic, foreign or supranational governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency or commission, any court,
tribunal, or arbitral body, or any quasi-governmental or private body
exercising regulatory, taxing, importing or other governmental authority (a
"Governmental Entity"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), state securities or
"blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), The Nasdaq National Market, Delaware state
takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act") and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) for such other
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, permits, filings or
notifications, which if not obtained or made could not be material to the
Company or Parent or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   SECTION 3.06 Permits; Compliance.

   (a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Entity necessary for the Company or any Company Subsidiary to own, lease and
operate

                                      A-10
<PAGE>

its material properties or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted (the "Company Permits"). All Company Permits are in full force and
effect in all material respects and will remain so after the Closing and no
suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened.

   (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict in any
material respect with, or in default or violation in any material respect of,
(i) any Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
affected, (ii) any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any material property or asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iii) any Company
Permits.

   SECTION 3.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

   (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since June
23, 1999 (collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"), and the Company has made
available to Parent correct and complete copies of each Company SEC Report,
including all exhibits thereto. As of the respective dates they were filed (and
if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then
on the date of such filing), (i) each Company SEC Report complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Securities Act") or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) none of the
Company SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is required
to file any form, report or other document with the SEC or any similar foreign
agency or governmental entity.

   (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "Company Financial
Statements") was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or 8-K promulgated by the SEC)
and each presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that could not be reasonably expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect). The most recent balance
sheet of the Company contained in the Company SEC Reports as of October 31,
2000 is hereinafter referred to as the "Company Balance Sheet".

   (c) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct
copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the
SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other
instruments that previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

   SECTION 3.08 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for (a) liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet, or in the
notes thereto, (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, since the date of the Company Balance Sheet and
(c) liabilities for fees and expenses of professional advisors arising out of
the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
that would be material to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                                      A-11
<PAGE>

   SECTION 3.09 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since April 30, 2000,
each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has conducted its business
only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and,
since such date, there has not been any:

     (a) Company Material Adverse Effect;

     (b) amendment or any other change to the Certificate of Incorporation or
  Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any Company
  Subsidiary;

     (c) issuance, sale, pledge, lease, license, disposition, grant,
  encumbrance, or authorization for any issuance, sale, pledge, lease,
  license, disposition, grant or encumbrance, of (i) any shares of capital
  stock of any class of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any
  options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any kind to
  acquire any shares of such stock, or any other ownership interest
  (including, without limitation, any phantom interest) of the Company or any
  Company Subsidiary (except for (x) the issuance of shares of Company Common
  Stock pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options and in accordance

   SECTION 3.11 Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters.

   (a) Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all
employee benefit plans (as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA) and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, restricted stock,
phantom stock, incentive, deferred compensation, executive compensation,
cafeteria benefit, dependent care, director or employee loan, fringe benefit,
sabbatical, retiree medical or life insurance, disability, supplemental
retirement, employment, severance, termination pay or other benefit plans,
programs or arrangements, including (without limitation) any arrangements that
contain change of control or vesting acceleration provisions, whether legally
enforceable or not, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party,
with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation
or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) each employee
benefit plan for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur
liability under section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were
to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary could incur liability under section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any
contracts or arrangements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any
employee or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary including,
without limitation, any contracts, arrangements or understandings relating to a
sale of the Company (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans").

   (b) Each Company Benefit Plan is in writing and the Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of each Company Benefit Plan and a
true and complete copy of each material document, if any, prepared in
connection with each such Company Benefit Plan, including, without limitation,
(i) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan
description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the three (3) most
recent annual reports (Form 5500 series and all schedules and financial
statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in
connection with each Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recently received IRS
determination letter for each such Company Benefit Plan, if such plan is
intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, (v) any actuarial report and
financial statement in connection with each such Company Benefit Plan for the
three most recent plan years, (vi) any correspondence with the IRS or the
Department of Labor with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan and (vii)
each form of notice of grant or stock option agreement used to document Company
Stock Options. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no other employee benefit plans, programs,
arrangements or agreements, whether formal or informal, whether in writing or
not, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, with respect to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or which are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has express or implied commitment, whether legally
enforceable or not, (x) to create, incur liability with respect to, or cause to
exist, any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (y) to enter
into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits to any
individual, or (z) to modify, change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
other than with respect to a modification, change or termination required by
ERISA or the Code.

   (c) None of the Company Benefit Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the
meaning of section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a
single employer pension plan (within the meaning of section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA) for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur liability
under section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the
Company Benefit Plans provides

                                      A-14
<PAGE>

for or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than procedures intended to comply with the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"). Each of the
Company Benefit Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof.

   (d) None of the Company Benefit Plans provides for the payment of
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person or
obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay separation, severance,
termination or similar benefits solely or partially as a result of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a "change in
ownership or control," within the meaning of such term under section 280G of
the Code. No amounts payable under the Company Benefit Plans solely as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of section 280G
of the Code. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or together
with another event, will (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, forgiveness
of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan or
other arrangement, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
vesting or funding of any benefits including, but not limited to, the
acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of any Company Stock Options, or
(iv) affect in any material respects any Company Benefit Plan's current
treatment under any Laws including any tax or social contribution law. No
Company Benefit Plan provides or reflects or represents any liability to
provide retiree health to any person for any reason, except as may be required
by COBRA or other applicable statute, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written
form) to any employee (either individually or to employees as a group) or any
other person that such employee(s) or other person would be provided with
retiree health, except to the extent required by statute.

   (e) Each Company Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated in
accordance in all material respects with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws, regulations and rules promulgated thereunder including,
without limitation, ERISA, COBRA, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, as
amended ("FMLA"), and the Code. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under, is not in any material respect in default under or in violation of,
and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Company
Benefit Plan. No action, claim or proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that
could give rise to any such action, claim or proceeding. Neither the Company
nor any person that is a member of the same controlled group as the Company or
under common control with the Company within the meaning of section 414 of the
Code (each, an "ERISA Affiliate") is subject to any penalty or tax with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan under section 402(i) of ERISA or sections 4975
through 4980 of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued as of or after the Effective Time, without material
liability to the Parent, Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than
ordinary administration expenses). Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary nor any affiliate has, prior to the Effective Time and in any
material respect, violated any of the health care continuation requirements of
COBRA, the requirements of FMLA, the requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Women's
Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns' and
Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such act, or
any similar provisions of state Law applicable to its employees.

   (f) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under section 401(a) or
section 401(k) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under section
501(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination, opinion,
notification or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to each such Company
Benefit Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt

                                      A-15
<PAGE>

status of any such trust, or has remaining a period of time under applicable
Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter
and make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the
qualified status of each such Company Benefit Plan.

   (g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has
any accumulated funding deficiency under section 412 of the Code or has
incurred any liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of
ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation arising in the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any
liability in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any
employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from
any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists
which could give rise to any such liability.

   (h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has, since January 1, 1995,
terminated, suspended, discontinued contributions to or withdrawn from any
employee pension benefit plan, as defined in section 3(2) of ERISA, including,
without limitation, any multiemployer plan, as defined in section 3(37) of
ERISA. All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made or accrued
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due
dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes
and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental
Entity and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists which
could give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

   (i) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (i) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
persons employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or in the Company's
or any Company Subsidiary's business, and currently there are no organizational
campaigns, petitions or other unionization activities seeking recognition of a
collective bargaining unit which could affect the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; (ii) there are no controversies, strikes, slowdowns or work
stoppages pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company after reasonable due

past three years; (iii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
breached or otherwise failed to comply with the provisions of any collective
bargaining or union contract and there are no grievances outstanding against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any such agreement or; (iv) there
are no unfair labor practice complaints pending against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary before the National Labor Relations Board or any other
Governmental Entity or any current union representation questions involving
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (v) the Company and each
Company Subsidiary is currently in compliance in all material respects with all

by the appropriate Governmental Entity and has withheld and paid to the

Governmental Entity all amounts required to be withheld from employees of the

United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other

vice president or higher.

or 404 of the Code. The Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax
indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement (whether written or
unwritten or arising under operation of federal Law as a result of being a
member of a group filing consolidated Company Tax Returns, under operation of
certain state Laws as a result of being a member of a unitary group, or under
comparable Laws of other states or foreign jurisdictions) which includes a

                                   ARTICLE IV

            Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

   Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company that the
statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule"). The Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged according to
specific sections in this Article IV and shall provide exceptions to, or
otherwise qualify in reasonable detail, only the corresponding section in this
Article IV and any other section in this Article IV where it is reasonably
clear, upon a reading of such disclosure without any independent knowledge on
the part of the reader regarding the matter disclosed, that the disclosure is
intended to apply to such other section.

   SECTION 4.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Section 4.01 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth the jurisdiction of incorporation of
Parent and each subsidiary of Parent required to be disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports (as defined in Section 4.06(a) below) (the "Parent Subsidiaries"). Each
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of such jurisdiction and has all
requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to obtain such
governmental approvals has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation or organization to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any
changes in or effects on the business of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that,
individually or in the aggregate, are or are substantially likely to be
materially adverse to the business, financial condition, assets (tangible or
intangible), liabilities (including contingent liabilities), or results of
operations of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except for
any such changes or effects principally resulting from or principally arising
in connection with (i) any changes affecting the respective

                                      A-24
<PAGE>

industries in which Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries operate that do not have
a disproportionate impact on Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (ii) any changes in general economic conditions that do not
disproportionately impact Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) in and of itself, any change in the trading price of the Parent Common
Shares, (iv) in and of itself, a failure by Parent to meet the revenue or
earnings predictions of equity analysts for any period ending (or for which
earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date, (v) the taking of any action expressly required by the terms of
this Agreement or (vi) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of
facts or development to the extent primarily attributable to the announcement
or pendency of the Merger; provided, however, that Parent shall bear the burden
of showing that such change, effect, event, occurrence, state of fact or
development which Parent claims does not constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect is primarily attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger.

   SECTION 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Parent has heretofore
made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, of Parent and Merger Sub.

authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
outstanding obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any Parent Common Shares or any capital stock or
other equity interest of any Parent Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of
capital stock or other equity interest of each Parent Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and each such share
or other equity interest owned by Parent or another Parent Subsidiary is free
and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of
first refusal, agreements, limitations on Parent's or such other Parent
Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever, except where failure to own such shares free and clear would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Parent Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments

there has not been any Parent Material Adverse Effect.

   SECTION 4.13 Absence of Litigation. There is no litigation, suit, claim,

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and except for
such items as have yet to be conceived or developed or that may reasonably be
expected to be available for licensing on reasonable terms from third parties.
With respect to patent rights, moral rights and Mark rights, the
representations and warranties of this Section 4.14(a) are made only to

be completed and filed when due (including any extensions of such due date) and
all amounts shown due on such Parent Tax Returns on or before the Effective
Time have been or will be paid on or before such date, except where the failure
to complete and file such Parent Tax Returns or to pay such amounts shown would

liabilities for Taxes (as defined in Section 3.16) with respect to all periods
through the date of the Parent Balance Sheet. All information set forth in the

   (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy
statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the
"Joint Proxy Statement") relating to the respective meetings of the Company's
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") to be held to consider
approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and of the Parent
stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting") to be held to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the
"Registration Statement") in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included

of the Parent Common Shares to be issued to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as promptly as practicable, and prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take all or any action required under any applicable federal or state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Shares
pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning itself as the other may reasonably request in connection
with such actions and the preparation of the Registration Statement and Joint
Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement
shall have become effective, each of Parent and the Company shall mail the
Joint Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders.

   (b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 6.01, the Joint Proxy Statement
shall include the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the stockholders of the Company to vote in favor of approving the
Merger and adoption of this Agreement and neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or

in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company that the Company's stockholders vote in favor
of and adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger. For purposes of
this Agreement, such recommendation of the Board of Directors shall be deemed
to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent if such recommendation
shall no longer be unanimous.

   (c) Prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company, nothing in
this Agreement shall prevent the Company's Board of Directors from withholding,
withdrawing, amending, modifying or changing its unanimous recommendation in
favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.05
below) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company shall have

that the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material

being agreed that the Company's Board of Directors shall convene a meeting to
consider any such offer by Parent as promptly as practicable following the

<PAGE>

consider any Competing Transaction (as defined in Section 6.05 below). Subject
to applicable laws, nothing contained in this Section 6.01(c) shall limit the
Company's obligation to convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting
(regardless of whether the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have been withheld, withdrawn, amended, modified or
changed).

   (d) The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous recommendation of
the Board of Directors of Parent to the stockholders of Parent to vote in favor
of approving the issuance of the Parent Common Shares pursuant to the Merger
and neither the Board of Directors Parent nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change, or propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify or change, in each case in a manner adverse to the
Company, the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent that
the Company's stockholders vote in favor of and approve the issuance of the

longer be unanimous.

Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the
Company without the approval of the other party (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each of Parent and the Company will advise
the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time at which the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

however, that the Company's Board of Directors shall furnish to Parent all
information provided to the person who has made the Superior Proposal to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided to Parent and
shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed as to the status of any
discussions regarding such Superior Proposal.

Company (other than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination

consummation of the contemplated transaction) that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines, in its good faith reasonable judgment (after
consultation with the Company's financial advisor), to be more favorable to the
Company stockholders from a financial point of view than the terms of the
Merger and with any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer committed or likely, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Company's Board of Directors (after consultation with the
Company's financial advisor), to be obtained by such third party on a timely
basis. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean
a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, sale or disposition or similar transaction involving the Company
pursuant to which a person (or its stockholders) would own, if consummated, all
or substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (or of the
surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving
entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

   SECTION 6.06 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the same provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement
and director exculpation as are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall

                                      A-34
<PAGE>

not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time were entitled
to indemnification, advancement or exculpation under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is
required by Law.

   (b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold
harmless, and, after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director or officer of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary and each such person that served at the request of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee, partner,
fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative, arising out of
or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as officers or
directors, in each case occurring before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i)
the Company or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by any Indemnified
Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company or to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, promptly after
statements therefor are received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall elect
to defend such action) and (ii) the Company and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that neither the Company, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

   (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions, taken as a whole, that are no less advantageous) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend pursuant
to this Section 6.06(c) more than an amount per year equal to 150% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (which premiums the
Company represents and warrants to be approximately $750,000 per year in the
aggregate).

   (d) This Section 6.06 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns. In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each

the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice for additional information or documentation and shall respond as
promptly as practicable to all reasonable inquiries and reasonable requests
received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in
connection with antitrust matters. The parties shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the making of all such filings or responses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.09, Parent shall not be required to

of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock.

Code. Following the Effective Time, neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent
nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code.

to enable such firms to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections

until such time as, in Parent's sole discretion, an orderly transition can be
accomplished and such employees may be transferred to employee benefit plans
and programs maintained by Parent for its and its affiliates' employees in the
United States. Parent shall take such reasonable actions, to the extent
permitted by Parent's benefit programs, as are necessary to allow eligible
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to participate in the
health, welfare and other employee benefits programs of Parent or alternative
benefits programs in the aggregate substantially equivalent to those applicable
to employees of Parent in similar functions and positions on similar terms (it
being understood that equity incentive plans, including, without limitation,
the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Purchase Plan, are not
considered employee benefits). Pending such action, Parent shall maintain the
effectiveness of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' benefit plans.
Each continuing employee shall be given credit, for purposes of any service
requirements for participation or vesting, for his or her period of service
with the Company credited under a similar benefit plan or program prior to the

   (b) The Company agrees that the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal
to the sum of $100 million (the "Termination Fee") and all of Parent's Expenses
up to $10,000,000:

     (i) if Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
  8.01(d); or

     (ii) if the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
  Section 8.01(e) hereof, and at or prior to such termination there shall
  exist or have been publicly proposed or widely known a Competing
  Transaction, and within 12 months of the date of the termination of this
  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e), a Competing Transaction shall have
  been consummated or the Company shall have entered into an agreement,
  letter of intent or similar arrangement relating to a Competing
  Transaction.

   (c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 8.05(b) shall be
made to Parent not later than five business days after delivery to the Company
of notice of demand for payment and an itemization setting forth in reasonable
detail all Expenses of Parent (which itemization may be supplemented and
updated from time to time by Parent until the 60th day after Parent delivers
such notice of demand for payment), and shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. Payment of the
Termination Fee and Expenses described in Section 8.05(b) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d) hereof; provided, however, that payment of such fee and
expenses shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of willful
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or the
breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

   (d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or
the Expenses when due, the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs
and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this Section 8.05, together with interest on such
Termination Fee and unpaid Expenses, commencing on the date that such
Termination Fee and Expenses became due, at a rate equal to the rate of
interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., from time to time, in The City
of New York, as such bank's Prime Rate plus 1.00%.
