Richmond Assets are not capable of being sold, assigned, transferred,
delivered or subleased without the consent or waiver of any Person, or if
such sale, assignment, transfer, delivery or sublease, or attempted sale,

dealt with as herein provided.

### 

  

### (c) MDA shall have no liability to the Parent Parties if any of the

Closing Date. To the extent that the consents and waivers referred to in
Section 2.3(a) are not obtained by MDA, or until the impediments to the sale,

### 

  

#### (i) hold the benefits of any such Richmond Asset referred to in Section

this Section 2.3(c);

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement, approved by MDA

in respect of any Person, including the right to elect to terminate in
accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice and request of Parent, at
the cost of Parent as agreed to.

  

#### 

  

 **2.4** ** _Assumption of Liabilities_**

  



  

Parent shall cause Can AcquisitionCo to assume, pay, satisfy, discharge,
perform and fulfill, from and after the Closing Date, all obligations and
liabilities of MDA relating to the Richmond Information Systems Business or
the Richmond Assets, other than Excluded Liabilities, including existing,
accrued or accruing (whether direct, indirect or contingent) as at the
Closing Date (the " **Assumed Liabilities** "). Such assumption shall be
pursuant to an assumption of liabilities agreement in form satisfactory to
the Parent, acting reasonably.

  



  

 **2.5** ** _Allocation of MDA Purchase Price_**

  



  

### (a) MDA, the MDA Selling Subsidiaries, Can AcquisitionCo and US
AcquisitionCo will allocate the Purchase Price among the Richmond Assets, the
Purchased Shares and the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with Exhibit
2.6(b) and MDA, the MDA Selling Subsidiaries, Can AcquisitionCo and US
AcquisitionCo will report the sale and purchase of the respective Richmond
Assets and Purchased Shares for all federal, provincial and local tax
purposes in accordance with such allocation.

  

### 

  

### (b) If (i) the Minister of National Revenue or any other competent
authority at any time questions or proposes to issue or issues any assessment
or assessments that would impose or imposes any liability for Tax of any
nature or kind on any of the parties or on any other person on the basis that
the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Richmond Assets and the
Purchased Shares at the date of this Agreement is greater or less than the
amount agreed (the " **Agreed Amount** ") and (ii) MDA and Parent agree or a
competent tribunal finally adjudges that the allocation is a greater or
lesser amount (the " **Adjusted Value** ") than the Agreed Amount, then (iii)
the Agreed Amount will be determined by reference to the Adjusted Value to
the exclusion of the Agreed Amount, and (iv) MDA and Parent will do all
such things and perform all such acts as may be necessary to revise the
Agreed Amount accordingly.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each of MDA and Purchaser will, subject to applicable Law and

required manner and using forms reasonably acceptable to their respective
counsel, and on the prescribed forms (if and when available), an election to

Richmond Assets (or such similar provisions as are or may be enacted) apply
to the amount of the consideration set out in Exhibit 2.6(b) attributable to
the non-competition provision (as described in Section 6.12(f) relating to
the Richmond Assets) and each of MDA and Can AcquisitionCo will prepare their
respective Tax Returns consistent with such joint election. If MDA and Can
AcquisitionCo subsequently mutually determine that the consideration paid to
MDA that can reasonably be regarded as attributable to the non-
competition provision is not the amount allocated by the parties in Exhibit
2.6(b), the consideration attributable to the non-competition provision will
be adjusted as between the consideration for the Richmond Assets and the
Purchased Shares and the non-competition provision (the " **Revised Agreed
Amount"** ). Thereafter, the consideration paid to MDA for the Richmond
Assets and the Purchased Shares will be

  

### 

  

### 19   

     
   

  

### 

  

### deemed to be and to have always to have been the corresponding amounts
under the Revised Agreed Amount and MDA and Can AcquisitionCo will amend
their elections or make such further elections as may be necessary. MDA and
Can AcquisitionCo will make any required elections under
corresponding provincial or territorial law and the foregoing provisions will
apply _mutatis mutandis_ in respect thereof.

MDA and Can AcquisitionCo will elect jointly in the prescribed form
and manner under Section 22 of the ITA as to the sale of the

MDA and Can AcquisitionCo will elect jointly pursuant to subsection 20(24) of
the ITA and its equivalent provisions under applicable provincial

to obligations of MDA from the Richmond Information Systems Business that
are described in paragraph 12(1)(a) of the ITA and Can AcquisitionCo
assumes as part of the Transaction. MDA acknowledges that at the Closing
Date, MDA will transfer to Can AcquisitionCo, applicable Richmond Assets
having a value equal to the amount of such obligations as consideration for
the assumption thereof by Can AcquisitionCo.

  



  

 **2.9** ** _Social Services Tax Act_**

Assets and the Purchased Shares shall be, subject to

  



        
   

  



  

adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3, $1,325,000,000. The Parent Parties

the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to MDA (A) a balance sheet
of the Information Systems Subsidiaries and MDA, with respect to the
Information Systems Business on a combined basis as of the Closing Date (the
" **Closing Date Balance Sheet** ") and (B) its calculation of Working
Capital as of the Closing Date (the " **Closing Working Capital** "), based on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet in the same form as the September Working
Capital Statement (the " **Closing Working Capital Statement** "). The Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement (together the "
**Closing Financial Data** ") shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and

acquisition contingencies, (8) any non-cash changes, between September 30,
2007 and the Closing Date, in contingencies and accruals within the estimate
of total project costs. For greater clarity, a non-cash change would not
include a reduction in project contingencies where there was a corresponding
increase in the estimated costs to complete a project, and (9) any amounts
related to any local authority modernization program contracts.

  

### 

  

### (b) MDA shall have 15 days (the " **Review Period** ") following receipt
of the Closing Financial Data in which to review the Closing Financial Data.
If at any time during the Review Period, MDA determines that it has any
objection to the Closing Financial Data or any aspect of the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, MDA may send a written notice (the " **WC Objection
Notice** ") explaining in reasonable detail such objection(s); provided, that
the WC Objection Notice shall be delivered to Parent, in accordance with
Section 10.2 hereof, no later than 10 business days following the last day of
the Review Period. Parent and MDA shall endeavour, in good faith, to resolve
the matters described in the WC Objection Notice. If Parent and MDA are unable
to resolve any of the matters described in the WC Objection Notice and agree
in writing to that resolution within 20 days after MDAs receipt thereof,
Parent and MDA shall promptly submit those items then remaining unresolved
for arbitration before Ernst and Young (Vancouver), or if they refuse or are
unable to act, a nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to MDA

  

### 

  

### 21   

     
   

  

### 

  

### and Parent (the " **Arbitrator** ") and such arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions hereof. The amount as shown on
the Working Capital Statement by the Arbitrator as Closing Working Capital
shall be the Final Closing Working Capital (as defined below). MDA on the one
hand, and Parent on the other hand, shall each bear one-half of the fees,
costs and expenses of the Arbitrator; _provided_ , however, that if the
Arbitrator determines that one party to the arbitration is the prevailing
party, then the non-prevailing party shall alone be responsible for the fees,
costs and expenses of arbitration incurred by all parties. " **Final Closing
Working Capital** " means (A) if no WC Objection Notice is given, the Closing
Working Capital or (B) if a WC Objection Notice is given with respect to
Closing Working Capital, the Closing Working Capital as agreed between Parent
and MDA, and if not so agreed, the Closing Working Capital as determined by
the Arbitrator.

  

### 

  

#### (i) If Final Closing Working Capital is greater than September Working
Capital, the Parent Parties shall promptly pay MDA an amount (the " **Working
Capital Adjustment** ") equal to Final Closing Working Capital less September
Working Capital. Payment of any Working Capital Adjustment shall be made by
wire transfer to the account of MDA as MDA shall notify Parent in writing,
together with interest at the Prime Rate from the Closing Date until the date
of payment.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If Final Closing Working Capital is less than September Working
Capital, MDA shall promptly pay to Parent on behalf of the Parent Parties an
amount (the " **Working Capital Deficiency** ") equal to September Working
Capital, less the Final Closing Working Capital. The Working Capital
Deficiency shall be paid by wire transfer to the account of Parent as Parent
shall notify MDA in writing, together with interest at the Prime Rate from
the Closing Date until the date of payment.

  

#### 

  

### (c) Parent and MDA will execute, if requested by the Arbitrator, a
reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities. The Arbitrator
shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the provisions of
this Section 3.3 and the representations by Parent and MDA, only on those
issues still in dispute and only as to whether such amounts were arrived at
in conformity with this Section 3.3. The Arbitrators determination shall be
made within 30 days of its selection, or such other period as mutually agreed
to by Parent and MDA, and shall be set forth in a written statement delivered
to Parent and MDA.  The arbitration proceedings under this Section 3.3(c)
shall be treated as confidential information. The Arbitrator shall be bound
by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this
Section 3.3(c) are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the
determination of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto. The decision rendered pursuant to this Section 3.3(c) may be filed as
a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either Parent or MDA may
seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any
decision under this Section 3.3(c). The other partys only defense to such a
request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
on the part of the Arbitrator. Absent such fraud, such other party
shall reimburse the party seeking enforcement for its expenses related to
such enforcement.

  

### 

  

### (d) The determination and adjustment of the Purchase Price in accordance
with the provisions of this Article shall not limit or affect any other
rights or causes of action the Parent may have with respect to the
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities in its favour
contained in this Agreement.

or constituting an Alternative Proposal, any request for representation on
the MDA board of directors, or any request for non-public information
relating to MDA or any Information Systems Subsidiary relating to or
constituting an Alternative Proposal of which MDAs directors, officers,
representatives or agents are or became aware. Such notice shall include
a description of the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, any proposal, inquiry, offer (including any amendment thereto)
or request, and shall include copies of any such proposal or offer or

such other details of the proposal or offer, or any amendment thereto, as
Parent may reasonably request. MDA shall keep Parent promptly and

any such proposal or offer, or any amendment thereto, and will respond
promptly to all inquiries by Parent with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (e) MDA shall ensure that its officers, directors, representatives,
agents and legal and financial advisors, and the Information Systems

of directors with respect to the approval of the MDA Shareholders in respect
of, or enter into any agreement relating to, an Alternative Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by Section 6.5(b)(ii)(D)
above) unless:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) MDA has provided Parent with notice in writing that there is a
Superior Proposal together with all documentation detailing the Superior
Proposal (including a copy of the confidentiality agreement between MDA and
the Person making the Superior Proposal if not previously delivered);

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) at least four Business Days shall have elapsed from the date that
Parent has received a copy of the written proposal in respect of the
purported Superior Proposal (or any amendment or revision thereof);

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) if Parent has proposed to amend the terms of the Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.5(g), the MDA board of directors (after
consultation with MDAs

  

#### 

  

#### 58   

     
   

  

#### 

  

#### outside counsel and financial advisors) shall have determined in good
faith that the Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account such amendments;

  

#### 

  

#### (v) MDAs board of directors, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; and

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) prior to entering into an agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal (other than the aforesaid confidentiality agreement) MDA shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(iii) and paid to Parent

### (g) MDA acknowledges and agrees that during the 4 Business Day period
referred to in Section 6.5(f)(iii), Parent shall have the opportunity, but
not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the Transaction and this
Agreement. The MDA board of directors will review any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of the Transaction and this Agreement in order to determine,
in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether such proposal
would result in the Alternative Proposal not being a Superior Proposal
compared to the proposed amendments to the terms of the Transaction and this
Agreement. MDA agrees that the fact and each of the terms of any such
proposed amendments shall be kept strictly confidential and not disclosed to
any party (including the party having made the Alternative Proposal) until
such amendment to this Agreement reflecting such proposal is executed, unless
required by the applicable Securities Laws. If the MDA board of directors
determines that such Alternative Proposal would cease to be a Superior
Proposal, as a result of such proposed amendments by Parent, MDA will so
advise Parent and will accept the offer by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the parties agree to take such actions and execute
such documents as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing. If Parent
does not offer proposed amendments that would in the reasonable good faith
judgement of the board of directors, after consultation with MDAs outside
counsel and financial advisors, cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to cease being a Superior Proposal then MDA may, subject to
the terms of this Agreement (including the prior payment of the Termination
Fee), accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of
such Superior Proposal (and change or withdraw its recommendation).

  

### 

  

### (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the MDA board of directors
from responding through a directors circular or otherwise as required by
applicable securities Laws to any Alternative Proposal or from calling and
holding a meeting of the Holders of the MDA Common Shares requisitioned by
such shareholders pursuant to Section 143 of the CBCA or ordered to be held
by a court pursuant to Section 144 of the CBCA.

  

### 

  

### (i) MDA acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of the
material terms of any Alternative Proposal shall constitute a new Alternative
Proposal for the purposes of this Section 6.5.

  

###

determining the value of the compensation offered to such employees
and establish, effective as of the Closing Date, benefit plans for the
Richmond Employees with a value substantially similar in the aggregate to

Date as described in Section 4.16 to the MDA Disclosure Letter. In such
offers, Can AcquisitionCo shall recognize, to the extent previously
recognized by MDA, the service of the Richmond Employees for all purposes and
shall recognize all terms of service, employment or consulting agreements,
vacation and severance obligations and accruals and benefits under any MDA
Plans. All accrued vacation, termination and severance obligations for the
Richmond Employees will be assumed by Can AcquisitionCo.  With respect to
the Non-Active Designated Employees, Can AcquisitionCo will only be obliged
to offer employment to any such employee if they are able to resume active
employment within 12 months of the Closing Date, in which case Can
AcquisitionCo shall make an offer of employment to such employees
on substantially similar terms in the aggregate to those the Non-Active
Designated Employees enjoyed immediately prior to becoming non-active, such
offers to be effective on the Non-Active Employee Start Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) Without limiting MDAs obligations in respect of Richmond Employees
employed prior to the Closing Date, MDA shall be responsible for:

  

### 

  

#### (i) all severance payments, damages for wrongful dismissal and all
related costs in respect of the termination by MDA of the employment of any
Richmond Employee who does not accept Can AcquisitionCos offer of employment
referred to in Section 6.6(b) provided that such offer is in compliance with
Section 6.6(b);

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) all liabilities for claims for injury, disability, death or
workers compensation arising from or related to employment in the Richmond
Information Systems Business prior to the Closing Date; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) all employment-related claims, penalties and assessments in
respect of the Richmond Information Systems Business arising out of matters
which occurred prior to the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

### (d) Section 6.6(d) of the MDA Disclosure Letter lists all MDA Plans that
are sponsored by MDA-Montreal or MDA-Brampton (collectively the "
**Assumed Plans** ").

  

### 

  

### (e) Parent agrees to cause any of the relevant Information Systems
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to maintain the relevant Assumed Plans in
force as at the Effective Time without adverse amendment (other that any
amendment which may be required to comply with Law) for the benefit of the
Affected Employees employed in Canada for no less than 12 calendar months
following the Effective Time. Parent will cause the relevant Information
Systems Subsidiaries to provide benefit plans to the Affected Employees in

  

### 

  

### 60   

     
   

  

### 

  

### the U.S. and the United Kingdom with an aggregate value substantially
similar to the MDA Plans those employees participated in prior to the Closing
Date. Parent agrees to cause the relevant Information Systems Subsidiaries to
provide compensation for all Affected Employees with a value substantially
similar in the aggregate to that received by them prior to the Closing Date
and for that purpose will take into consideration compensation received by
them under the Additional MDA Plans. For purposes of this Section 6.6(e), "
**Affected Employees** " means individuals who are actively employed by any
of the Information Systems Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, who are not
subject to a collective bargaining agreement and who remain employed with any
Information Systems Subsidiary immediately following the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (f) MDA will retain and be responsible for and will pay or cause to be
paid all amounts payable by reason of events with an Incurred Claim Date
prior to or on the Closing Date in respect of all Richmond Employees who
accept the offer of employment with Can AcquisitionCo contemplated in Section
6.6(b), provided, however, that with respect to Non-Active Designated
Employees, MDA will retain and be responsible for and will pay or cause to be
paid all amounts payable by reason of events with an Incurred Claim Date
prior to the Non-Active Employee Start Date, if applicable.  Parent and Can
AcquisitionCo shall be responsible for and will pay or cause to be paid all
amounts payable by reason of events with an Incurred Claim Date after the
Closing Date in respect of all Richmond Employees who accept the offer of
employment with Can AcquisitionCo contemplated in Section 6.6(b), provided,
however, that with respect to Non-Active Designated Employees having a Non-
Active Employee Start Date, the Parent and Can AcquisitionCo and
such comparable plans shall be responsible for and will pay or cause to be
paid all amounts payable by reason of events with an Incurred Claim Date
after the date such employee becomes an Can AcquisitionCo employee except to
the extent required to be assumed by Can AcquisitionCo pursuant to Section
6.6(b) or 6.6(c).

  

### 

  

### (g) For benefit plans maintained by Parent for which service and vesting
are a factor and for all severance or termination obligations whether under
agreement or by Law, Parent agrees to recognize each Affected Employees or
Richmond Employees credited service under a MDA Plan or otherwise, for such
purposes. MDA agrees not to modify any credited service or grant any
additional credited service to any Affected Employee or Richmond Employees.

  

### 

  

### (h) Nothing herein shall be construed as (i) limiting Parents, Can
AcquisitionCos or any Information Systems Subsidiarys ability to amend,
modify or terminate any individual employee benefit plan or arrangement of
MDA, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) requiring
Parent, Can AcquisitionCo or any Information Systems Subsidiary, to maintain
any particular level of employee benefits for any individual employee
following the Effective Time, except as expressly provided in this Section
6.6 with respect to Affected Employees and Richmond Employees only. No
Affected Employee or Richmond Employee is an intended third party beneficiary
of this Section 6.6.

  

### 

  

### (i) If required, Parent, MDA and Can AcquisitionCo will provide for any
post-closing obligations relating to this Section 6.6 in the Transitional
Services Agreement.

 **8.3** ** _Effect of Termination_**

  



  

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section
8.2, no party shall have any further liability to perform its obligations
hereunder except for the provisions of this Section 8.3 and Section 6.4(b),
Section 8.4, Section 8.6 and Section 10.9; provided that neither the
termination of this Agreement nor anything contained in this Section 8.3
shall relieve any party from any liability for any breach by it of this
Agreement, including from any inaccuracy in its representations and
warranties and any non-performance by it of its covenants and agreements made
herein. If it shall be judicially determined that termination of this
Agreement was caused by an intentional breach of this Agreement, then, in
addition to any other remedies at law or equity for breach of this Agreement,
the party so found to have intentionally breached this Agreement shall
indemnify and hold harmless the other parties for their out-of-pocket costs,
including fees and expenses of their counsel, accountants, financial advisors
and other experts and advisors, incidental to the negotiation, preparation
and execution of this Agreement and related documentation.

  



  

 **8.4** ** _Termination Fee_**

  



  

In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated:

  



  

### (a) pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(iii) or Section 8.2(c)(iv), or

  

### 

  

### (b) pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(v) or Section 8.2(c)(vi) and

  

### 

  

#### (i) a bona fide written proposal by a Person (the " **Acquisition
Proposal Offeror** ") other than Parent Parties or their Affiliates has been
made and publicly announced for an Alternative Proposal, not resulting from a
contravention of Section 6.5(a), after the date hereof and prior to the MDA
Meeting, and not withdrawn at least 5 Business Days prior to the vote of the
MDA Shareholders with respect to the Special Resolution; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) MDA enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Alternative Proposal with the Acquisition Proposal Offeror, or a Person
acting jointly or in concert with the Acquisition Proposal Offeror, prior to
the expiration of 180 days

  

#### 

        
   

  

#### 

  

#### following the termination of this Agreement, and thereafter consummates
such Alternative Proposal;

  

#### 

  

unless, at the time of the MDA Meeting a Specified AcquisitionCo Event has
occurred and is continuing;

  



  

### the Parent Parties would suffer direct and substantial damages, which
damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. To compensate the
Parent Parties for such damages, MDA shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee
as liquidated damages prior to or concurrently with such termination _less_
any amounts actually paid or required to be paid by MDA to Parent pursuant to
Section 8.6. In no event shall MDA be obligated to make more than one payment
referred to in this Section 8.4. It is specifically agreed that the amount
to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.4 represents liquidated damages and
not a penalty. MDA irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a
defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.

  

### 

  

For this purpose, " **Specified AcquisitionCo Event** " means a breach by any
Parent Party of their respective obligations hereunder that would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transaction or that would reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay the ability of Parent, Can AcquisitionCo or US AcquisitionCo to perform
their respective obligations hereunder, if by reason thereof, MDA would be
entitled to rely on the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3 to be
satisfied as a reason not to complete the Transaction.

  



  

 **8.5** ** _Effect of Termination Fee Payment_**

  



  

For greater certainty, the parties hereto agree that if MDA pays
the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to and where required by the
provisions of Section 8.4, Parent and AcquisitionCo shall have no other
remedy for any breach of this Agreement by MDA.

  



  

 **8.6** ** _Expense Reimbursement_**

  



  

MDA shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the reasonable documented expenses of Parent and its
affiliates incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than any expenses related to a broker, finder or investment banker)
not to exceed $2.5 million in the event that this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(v) or Section 8.2(c)(vi).

 ** **

  

 **9.4** ** ****_Limits on Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_**

  

 ** **

based upon fraud, intentional misrepresentation or any of the Core
Representations) shall be subject to the following:

  



  

### (a) except as provided in Section 9.4(c), the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder unless and until the

### 

  

The sole recourse for indemnification claims made by the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall be recovery of amounts in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

 **9.5** ** ****_Indemnification Procedures_**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) For purposes of this Section 9.5, a party against which
indemnification may be sought is referred to as the " **Indemnifying Party** "
and the party which may be entitled to indemnification is referred to as the
" **Indemnified Part** y."

  

### 

  

### (b) If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a Loss or potential Loss in
respect of which the Indemnifying Party has agreed to indemnify it under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party will promptly give written notice of its
claim or potential claim for indemnification (an " **Indemnity Claim** ") to
the Indemnifying Party. The notice must specify whether the Indemnity Claim
arises as the result of a claim made against the Indemnified Party by a
Person who is not a Party (a " **Third Party Claim** ") or as a result of
a Loss that was suffered directly (a " **Direct Claim** "), and must also
specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is
available):

  

### 

  

#### (i) the factual basis for the Indemnity Claim; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the amount of the Indemnity Claim, if known.

  

#### 

  

If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party does
not receive notice of an Indemnity Claim in time effectively to contest the
determination of any liability capable of being contested, the Indemnifying
Party will be entitled to set off against the amount claimed by

  



        
   

  



  

the Indemnified Party the amount of any Loss incurred by the Indemnifying
Party resulting from the Indemnified Partys failure to give the notice on a
timely basis.

  



  

 **9.6** ** ****_Direct Claims_**

  

 ** **

  

Following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of a Direct Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will have 20 Business Days to make any investigations it
considers necessary or desirable. For the purpose of those investigations,
the Indemnified Party will make available to the Indemnifying Party the
information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Direct
Claim, together with all other information that the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. If both Parties agree at or before the expiration of
such 20 Business Day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension) to the
validity and amount of the Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay
immediately to the Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the
Direct Claim.

  



  

 **9.7** ** ****_Third Party Claims_**

  

 ** **

  

The following applies to any Indemnity Claim:

  



  

### (a) If the Indemnity Claim relates to a Third Party Claim that the
Indemnified Party is required by applicable Law to pay without a prior
opportunity to contest it, the Indemnified Party may, despite Sections 9.7(c)
and (d) and 9.7(e)(i), make the payment without affecting its right to make
an Indemnity Claim in accordance with this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party
copies of all correspondence, notices, assessments or other written
communication received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any Third Party
Claim.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Indemnified Party will not negotiate, settle, compromise or pay
any Third Party Claim with respect to which it has asserted or proposes to
assert an Indemnity Claim, without the prior consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Indemnified Party will not cause or permit the termination of any
right of appeal in respect of any Third Party Claim which is or might become
the basis of an Indemnity Claim without giving the Indemnifying Party written
notice thereof and an opportunity to contest the Third Party Claim.

  

### 

  

### (e) If the Indemnifying Party first acknowledges in writing its
obligation to satisfy an Indemnity Claim to the extent of any binding
determination or settlement in connection with a Third Party Claim (or enters
into arrangements otherwise satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), in any
legal or administrative proceeding in connection with the matters forming the
basis of a Third Party Claim, the following will apply:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Indemnifying Party will have the right, subject to the rights of
any insurer or third party having potential liability therefor, by written
notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days of receipt
by the Indemnified Party of the notice of the Indemnity Claim to assume
carriage and control of the negotiation, defence or settlement of a Third
Party Claim and the conduct of any related legal or administrative
proceedings at the expense of the Indemnifying Party and by its own counsel;

  



        
   

  



  

#### (ii) if the Indemnifying Party elects to assume carriage and control,
the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate at its own expense
in the negotiation, defence or settlement of a Third Party Claim assisted by
counsel of its own choosing;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will make
all reasonable efforts to make available to the Party who has assumed
carriage and control of the negotiation, defence or settlement of a Third
Party Claim those employees whose assistance or evidence is necessary to
assist such Party in evaluating and defending that Third Party Claim and all
documents, records and other materials in the possession or control of such
Party required for use in the evaluation and the defence of that Third Party
Claim;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) despite clauses 9.7(e)(i), (ii) and (iii) above, the Indemnifying
Party will not settle a Third Party Claim or conduct any related legal or
administrative proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, unless:

  

#### 

  

##### (A) the terms of the compromise and settlement or remedy require only
the payment of money for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to full
indemnification under this Agreement;

  

##### 

  

##### (B) the Indemnified Party is not required to admit any wrongdoing, take
or refrain from taking any action, acknowledge any rights of the Person
making the Third Party Claim or waive any rights that the Indemnified Party
may have against the Person making the Third Party Claim; and

  

##### 

  

##### (C) the Indemnified Party receives, as part of the compromise and
settlement or remedy, a legally binding and enforceable unconditional release
from any and all obligations or liabilities it may have with respect to the
Third Party Claim. Such release must be, in form and substance, satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably ; and

  

##### 

  

#### (v) the Indemnifying Party will indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Party of and from any Loss incurred or suffered as a result of
the Indemnifying Partys settlement of the Third Party Claim or conduct of
any related legal or administrative proceeding.

  

#### 

  

### (f) The Indemnified Party will pursue any Indemnity Claim made by the
Indemnified Party under this Agreement with reasonable diligence and
dispatch.

  

### 

  

 **9.8** ** ****_Losses Net of Insurance, Tax Benefits_**

  

 ** **

  

The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided to a Parent
Indemnified Party under this Article 9 shall be net of any immediate tax
benefit to the Parent Indemnified Party related to the increase in such Loss
to the extent such tax benefit is actually received by the Parent Indemnified
Party in the taxable year of receipt of payment of such Loss or any prior
taxable year and net of any amounts recovered by the Parent Indemnified Party
with respect to such Loss under insurance policies.

  



        
   

  



  

 **9.9** ** ****_Duty to Mitigate_**

  

 ** **

  

Parent shall, and shall cause the Information Systems Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by
Parent or any Subsidiary arising out of any matter for which any Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto.

  



  

 **9.10** ** ****_Subrogation of Rights_**

  

 ** **

  

The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party.  Each Indemnified Party shall take all commercially
reasonable action to perfect the above subrogation rights and the Indemnified
Party shall pursue all claims of MDA, Parent and the Information Systems
Subsidiaries under all of its agreements and instruments, including without
limitation, those agreements and instruments relating to prior acquisitions
by Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action the
purpose or intent of which is to prejudice the defense of any claim subject
to indemnification hereunder or to induce a third party to assert a claim
subject to indemnification hereunder.

 **10.8** ** ****_Further Assurances_**

  

 ** **

  

Each party hereto shall, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, at

 **10.10** ** ****_Public Announcements_**

  

 ** **

  

The initial press release concerning the Transaction shall be a joint press
release and thereafter for a period to the Closing Date, Parent and MDA agree
to consult with each other prior to issuing any news releases or public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction, and to use
their respective reasonable efforts not to issue any news releases or public
statements inconsistent with the results of such consultations. Subject to

 **10.12** ** ****_Remedies_**

  

 ** **

  

The parties acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages would be
inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party or its
representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching
party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the
parties, the parties will also be entitled, without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive
relief and specific performance, provided such party is not in material
default hereunder. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any
breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity to each of the parties.

 ** **

  

Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

 ** **

  

This Agreement including the disclosure letters, the agreements and other
documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, among the parties
hereto with respect to the matters hereof and thereof.

  



  

 **10.15** ** ****_Severability_**

  

 ** **

  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



        
   

  



  

 **10.16** ** ****_Counterparts_**

  

 ** **

  

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

  



  

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on
January 8, 2008 effective as of the date first written above.
