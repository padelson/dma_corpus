Section 2.03 Transactions to be Effected at the Closing.

(i) The Cash Consideration, subject to any Closing Adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.04(a)_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an

Section 2.04 Cash Consideration Adjustment.

 

(a) Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) At least three (3) Business Days before the Closing, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of
Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), which
statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein)
and a separate statement of the amount of cash in the Companys bank accounts
as of the Closing Date and a description of the dollar amount of each such
account (the "Actual Closing Cash"), a calculation of Estimated Closing
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement"), and a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Seller that the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with  _Exhibit
C_ and GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the Annual Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end as if
such Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement was being prepared and
audited as of a fiscal year end. The Actual Closing Cash shall include cash
held in the Companys bank accounts of at least $650,000 ("Required Closing
Cash") (and which, for great certainty and without duplication, shall be
included in the Closing Working Capital). If the Actual Closing Cash is less
than the Required Closing Cash at Closing then Seller shall pay to Buyer at
Closing an amount equal to the difference between the Companys Required
Closing Cash and the Actual Closing Cash (the "Closing Cash Deficiency").

 

(ii) The "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Working Capital minus $9,850,000 (the "Target Working Capital"). If
the Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Cash Consideration shall be
increased by the amount of the Closing Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment
is a negative number, the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the amount
of the Closing Adjustment.

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement setting forth its calculation of Closing
Working Capital (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein), a calculation of Closing Working Capital (the "Closing Working
Capital Statement") and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer
that the Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with
_Exhibit C_ and GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Annual Financial Statements for the most
recent fiscal year end as if such Closing Working Capital Statement was being
prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end.

 



11 (ii) Subject to _Section 2.04(c)_ below, the post-closing adjustment shall be
an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing
Working Capital (the "Post-Closing Adjustment"). If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a positive number, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative
number, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment, which amount shall be paid directly by Seller and shall not be
released from the Holdback Escrow Fund.

 

(c) Examination and Review.

 

(i) _Examination._ After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Seller shall have thirty (30) days (the "Review Period") to review the
Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and
Sellers Accountants shall have full access to the books and records of the
Company, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or Buyers
Accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Working Capital
Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent in
Buyers possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement
as Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing
Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections (defined
below), _provided, that_ such access shall be in a manner that does not
interfere with the normal business operations of Buyer or the Company.

(ii) _Objection._ On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Seller may
object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to Buyer a
written statement setting forth Sellers objections in reasonable detail,
indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Sellers
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If Seller fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall
be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If Seller delivers the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"),
and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-
Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such
changes as may have been agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller, shall be final
and binding.

(iii)  _Resolution of Disputes._ If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of an
impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants (other than Sellers Accountants or Buyers Accountants) mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and Seller (the "Independent Accountants") who, acting as
experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve 

 



12  the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing
Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement, as the case may be. The
parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to
materiality. The Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific items
under dispute by the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must
be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing
Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountants._  Seller shall pay a portion of
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants equal to 100% multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of Disputed Amounts
submitted to the Independent Accountants that are resolved in favor of Buyer
(that being the difference between the Independent Accountants determination
and Sellers determination) and the denominator of which is the total amount
of Disputed Amounts submitted to the Independent Accountants (that being the
sum total by which Buyers determination and Sellers determination differ
from the determination of the Independent Accountants). Buyer shall pay that
portion of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants that Seller is
not required to pay hereunder.

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountants._ The Independent Accountants
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(vi) _Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment._ Except as otherwise provided
herein, any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment, together with interest
calculated as set forth below, shall (A) be due (x) within five (5) Business
Days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Working Capital Statement or (y)
if there are Disputed Amounts, then within five (5) Business Days of the
resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account as is directed by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be. The amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment shall
bear interest from and including the Closing Date to the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to six percent. Such interest shall be calculated daily
on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year and the actual
number of days elapsed.

(d) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section
2.04_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration portion of
the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 2.05 Escrow Agreement. For the purpose of securing Sellers
indemnification obligations pursuant to  _Article VIII_ (collectively, the
"Holdback Matters"), Buyer, Seller and US Bank National Association (or such
other Person as the parties may agree) (the "Escrow Agent") shall enter into
the Escrow Agreement at Closing, and Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent at
the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available Dollars, an amount
equal to the Holdback Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Holdback
Escrow Fund pursuant to

 



13  the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Any amounts owed to Buyer with respect to
the Holdback Matters pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall be satisfied initially by deducting such amount from the Holdback
Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.06 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby shall take place at a
closing (the "Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m., Central time, no later than
three (3) Business Days after the last of the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which,
by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), at the offices of
Jackson Walker L.L.P., 901 Main Street, Suite 6000, Dallas, Texas 75202, or at
such other time or on such other date or at such other place as Seller and
Buyer may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes

Indemnified Person") that are presently set forth in organizational documents
of the Company.

(b) Subject to subsection (d) below, in addition, from and after the Closing

or completed Action, whether criminal, civil, administrative
or investigative, based on or arising out or relating to the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company and arising out of acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing (but solely to the extent of
the coverage actually provided for under the Tail Policy) (a "DandO
Indemnifiable Claim"), and (ii) advance to such DandO Indemnified Persons all
DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim
(including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed
statements therefor (but solely to the extent of the coverage actually
provided for under the Tail Policy); provided, however, that the DandO
Indemnified Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such

responsible to pay the premiums for such insurance for eighteen (18) months
following the Closing and Seller shall be solely responsible for the premiums
for such insurance thereafter (or, if the premiums for the entire term of the
insurance is payable in a single or multiple payments during a period that is
less than six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for 25%
of the aggregate amount of such premiums and Seller shall be responsible for
the balance thereof.) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to,
cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect, provided that all
maintenance and premium obligations of Seller have been satisfied.

assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or

information as may be reasonably required for circulars or other disclosure
documents relating to the financing); (ii) making the Companys senior
officers reasonably available to Buyers Financing sources in connection with
the

 



40  Financing, to reasonably participate in due diligence and marketing

including the Patriot Act.

 

(b) In addition to the foregoing, Seller and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide audited

December 31, in each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the related
statements of income, retained earnings, stockholders equity and cash flows

inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning
a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller

Affiliates (including the Company) and all of its and their Representatives
to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition

liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination
transaction involving the Company; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of shares

shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after receipt
thereof by Seller or its Representatives) advise Buyer of any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and
the identity of the Person making the same.

 



41 (c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this 
_Section 5.09_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

Section 5.10 Notice of Certain Events.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
in writing of:

 

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (B) has resulted
in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any representation or
warranty made by Seller hereunder not being true and correct and Seller shall
take the actions required by _Section 5.03_ or (C) has resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.02_ to be satisfied;

 

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Seller or the
Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section 3.17_ or that relates to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03_, Buyers receipt of information
pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by Seller in
this Agreement (including _Section 8.02_ and  _Section 9.01(b)_) and shall
not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules.

Section 5.11 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Buyer with respect
to Seller pursuant to this Agreement after the Closing. If this Agreement is,
for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect.

 



42 Section 5.12 Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an interest in
any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted Business in
the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder, member,
employee, principal, agent, trustee, lender or consultant; or (iii) interfere
in any respect with the business relationships (whether formed prior to
or after the date of this Agreement) between the Company and customers or
suppliers of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may own,
directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person
traded on any national securities exchange if Seller is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such
Person.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
the Company or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire
any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees;
_provided, that_ nothing in this _Section 5.12(b)_ shall prevent Seller or
any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose employment has been
terminated by the Company or Buyer; (ii) after 180 days from the date of
termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been terminated
by the employee; or (iii) any employee, other than a management employee, as a
result of the use of a general solicitation (such as a newspaper or internet
advertisement) not specifically directed to such employee.

(c) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this _Section
5.12(c)_ would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief,
including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance
and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent
jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

(d) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this  _Section
5.12(d)_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 5.12(d)_ should ever
be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product
or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this  _Section 5.12(d)_ and each provision hereof are severable
and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of
any such covenant or provision

 



43  as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining
covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant
or provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 5.13 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, (i) make, or cause or be
made, all filings and submissions required under any Law applicable to such
party or any of its Affiliates; and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary
for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in
promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals, including the Required Consents. The parties hereto shall not
willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to give all notices to,
and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in
_Section 3.05 of the Disclosure Schedules_.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertakings pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b) above, each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding antitrust
or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any agreement or any Transaction Document;

(ii) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would
restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Transaction Document; and

(iii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Transaction Document has been issued, to have such Governmental Order
vacated or lifted.

 

(d) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any right
or benefit under any Contract to which the Company is a party is not obtained
prior to the Closing, Seller shall, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with
Buyer and the Company in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or
authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If such consent, approval
or authorization cannot be obtained, upon the request of Buyer, Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Company with the rights and
benefits of the affected Contract for the term thereof, and, if Seller
provides such rights and benefits, the Company shall assume all obligations
and burdens thereunder.

(e) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any

 



44  Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between Seller or
the Company with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of business)
shall be disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing,
submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult
and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals. Each party shall give notice to the other party with respect to
any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority
or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice
being sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall
require, or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to agree
to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing
Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or
restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests
which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the economic or business
benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii)
any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

__(g) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all Required Consents on or prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however _,_ that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any
consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested. __

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose,
for a period of four (4) years after the Closing, Buyer shall:

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent
with the prior practices of the Company; and

 

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Seller reasonable
access (including the right to make, at Sellers expense, photocopies),
during normal business hours, to such books and records;

_provided, however_ , that any books and records related to Tax matters
shall be retained pursuant to the periods set forth in _Article VI_.

 



45 (b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Buyer or the Company after the Closing, or for any other

relate to the Company and its operations for periods prior to the Closing;
and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Buyer or the
Company reasonable access (including the right to make, at Buyers expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records;

_provided, however_ , that any books and records related to Tax matters shall
be retained pursuant to the periods set forth in _Article VI_.

(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this _Section 5.14_ where such access would violate any Law.

 

Section 5.15 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
party hereto shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, use reasonable
best efforts to take such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy
the closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof.

this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or otherwise communicate with any news media
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to
the timing and contents of any such announcement.

 

Section 5.17 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and

ARTICLE VI

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 6.01 Tax Covenants.

 

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller (and, prior to the
Closing, the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives)
shall not, to the extent it may

 



46  affect, or relate to, the Company, make, change or rescind any Tax election,
amend any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return, take any action,
omit to take any action or enter into any other transaction that would have
the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of Buyer
or the Company in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing
Straddle Period, provided, however, that Seller, the Company, its Affiliates
and their respective representatives shall be entitled to make any Tax
election and take any action or enter into any other transactions without the
consent of Buyer provided that such Tax election, action or transaction is in
Sellers, the Companys or the Affiliates ordinary course of business.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer shall not, to the
extent it may affect, or relate to, the Company, make, change or rescind any
Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return,
take any action, omit to take any action or enter into any other transaction
that would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax
asset of Seller or the Company in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Pre-Closing Straddle Period, provided, however, that Buyer, the Company,
its Affiliates and their respective representatives shall be entitled to make
any Tax election and take any action or enter into any other transactions
without the consent of Seller provided that such Tax election, action or
transaction is in the Companys ordinary course of business.

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
(including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be
borne and paid by Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely
file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and
Seller shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

 

(d) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(the "Pre-Closing Period Returns"). The Pre-Closing Period Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the Companys and/or
the Sellers prior practice (including, without limitation, prior Tax
elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the
Company and/or the Seller), except as required by Law. Buyer shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, the Straddle Period Returns. The Straddle
Period Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
(unless otherwise required by Law) and without a change of any election or any
accounting method and shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting
documentation) at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) of such Tax Return. If Seller objects to any item on any such
Straddle Period Return, it shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of such
Tax Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such
agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer of such notice,
the disputed items shall be resolved by resolved by a

 



47  nationally recognized accounting firm selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to Seller (the "Accounting Referee"), and any determination by the
Accounting Referee shall be final. The Accounting Referee shall resolve any
disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the item referred to it
pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the Accounting Referee is
unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return,
the Straddle Period Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer subject to
amendment to reflect the Accounting Referees resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. The Buyer shall not amend any Straddle Period Returns, or make or
amend any material claim, disclaimer or election in respect of Taxes for any
Straddle Period, without the prior written consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company other than Pre-Closing
Period Returns and Straddle Period Returns shall be exclusively within the
control of Buyer.

 

Section 6.02 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon the
Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date neither
the Company, Seller nor any of Sellers Affiliates and their respective
Representatives shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

 

Section 6.03 Tax Indemnification

 

(a) Except to the extent treated as a liability in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, Seller shall indemnify the Company, Buyer, and each Buyer
Indemnitee and hold them harmless from and against (i) all Pre-Closing Taxes
of the Company; (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company (or any predecessor of
the Company) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of
a liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable
provisions of foreign, state or local Law; and (iii) all Taxes of any person
imposed on the Company arising under the principles of transferee or
successor liability or by contract, relating to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing Date. In each of the above cases, together with
any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys and accountants
fees) incurred in connection therewith; provided however, that in the case of
any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys and accountants
fees) incurred in connection with Pre-Closing Taxes, Seller shall only
indemnify Buyer for the fees and expenses (including attorneys and
accountants fees) of Buyer that relate to Pre-Closing Taxes of a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company that
are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.03(a)_ within
ten (10) Business Days after payment of such Taxes by Buyer or the Company.

 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify each Seller Indemnitee and hold them harmless from
and against (i) all Post-Closing Taxes of the Company; (ii) all Taxes for
which the Buyer is liable pursuant to _Section 6.01(c)_ and (iii) Taxes that
arise as a result of a voluntary transaction, action or omission carried out
or effected by the Buyer or any of the Buyers Affiliates (including the
Company) at any time after the Closing on the Closing Date, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall

 



48  remain liable for Taxes attributable to such transactions, actions or
omissions that are carried out or effected on the Closing Date under a legally
binding commitment of the Company created before the Closing. In each of the
above cases, together with any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
attorneys and accountants fees) incurred in connection therewith; provided
however, that in the case of any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
attorneys and accountants fees) incurred in connection with Post-Closing
Taxes, Buyer shall only indemnify Seller for the fees and expenses (including
attorneys and accountants fees) of Seller that relate to Post-Closing Taxes
of a Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any Taxes of
the Company that are the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to this _Section
6.03(b)_ within ten (10) Business Days after payment of such Taxes by Seller.

Section 6.04 Straddle Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of
Taxes attributable to the income, property or operations of the Company for
any taxable period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") will be apportioned between the period
of the Straddle Period that begins before the Closing Date and ends on and
includes the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and the period
of the Straddle Period that begins the day after the Closing Date and ends at
the end of the Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period") in
accordance with this _Section 6.04_. For purposes of this _Section 6.04_,
the portion of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i)
in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes,
withholding taxes and any other Tax based on or measured by income, business
activity, receipts or profits earned by the Company during a Straddle Period,
be deemed to equal the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period
ended on and included the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of personal
property, real property, ad valorem and other Taxes of the Company imposed on
a periodic basis during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of the
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
portion of Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period shall be
calculated in a corresponding manner.

Section 6.05 Contests. If any Governmental Authority issues to the Company a
written notice of its intent to audit, examine or conduct a proceeding, a
written notice of its determination of an objection to an assessment with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or a Straddle Period, or a written notice or inquiry with respect to any Taxes
or the filing of a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period (a "Tax Claim"), Buyer shall notify Seller of its receipt of such Tax
Claim within ten (10) Business Days following receipt, provided however, that
the failure of the Buyer to notify Seller of its receipt of a Tax Claim within
ten (10) Business Days shall not relieve the Seller from liability pursuant
to _Section 6.03(a)_ except to the extent the Seller is materially prejudiced
as a consequence of such failure. Seller shall control any Tax Claim and any
other matter with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company (a
"Sellers Tax Contest"), provided that Buyer, at its sole cost and expense,
shall have the right to participate in any Sellers Tax Contest

 



49  that does not involve income Taxes and provided further that the Seller
shall provide the Buyer with a copy of the final resolution of any Sellers
Tax Contest and any other information reasonably requested by Buyer
concerning any Sellers Tax Contest, provided that such requests relate solely
to information of the Company. The Buyer shall control any Tax Claim that is
not a Sellers Tax Contest (a "Buyers Tax Contest"), provided that Seller,
at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to participate in any
Buyers Tax Contest that relates to a Straddle Period Return. The party
controlling a Tax Claim described in the preceding sentence shall not agree
to settle such Tax Claim if such settlement could affect the Tax liability of
the other party without the written consent of such other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that if
any party (the "First Party") shall reasonably withhold consent for a
settlement, the other party (the "Second Party") shall be entitled to enter
into such settlement without the consent of the First Party so long as the
Second Party agrees to indemnify the First Party for any adverse Tax
consequences suffered by the First Party as a result of such settlement.

 

Section 6.06 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds of the Company and/or the Seller or
its Affiliates that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing
Straddle Period of the Company and that are received by Buyer, and any amounts
applied in lieu of a refund against Taxes of the Buyer and/or its Affiliates
that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period of
the Company, shall be for the account of the Seller to the extent such refund
or application was not reflected in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of
such application within fifteen (15) days after receipt or application
against Tax; provided, however, that the foregoing portion of this _Section
6.06_ shall not apply to any portion of such Tax refunds or amounts applied in
lieu of a refund against Taxes of the Buyer and/or its Affiliates that result
from the carryback or other application of any loss, credit or other Tax
attribute arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period or a Post-Closing Straddle
Period of the Company.

 

Section 6.07 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this
Article VI or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Straddle Period until the expiration of
the statute of limitations of such taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective
Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of the Company (i.e., such information does not
include information of

 



50  any other member of any consolidated group of which the Company is a member)
for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer (as
the case may be) shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice
and offer the other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

Section 6.08 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification
payments pursuant to this Article VI shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law. 

Section 6.09 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of Section 3.22 and this Article VI shall survive
for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect
to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days.

 

Section 6.10 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility
pursuant to Article VIII may overlap with an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to this Article VI, the provisions of this Article VI shall govern.

ARTICLE VII

breach that gives rise to such Loss.

57 Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
_Article VIII_ is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article VIII_ is referred to
as the "Indemnifying Party".

 

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of
such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; _provided, that_ if the Indemnifying Party is Seller,
such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the
defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly by or on
behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer of the Company, or (y) seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to _Section 8.05(b)_, it shall have the right to take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof.
The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party, _provided, that_ if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 8.05(b)_, pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of

 



58  any Third Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions
of Section 5.11) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses)
to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may
be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim.

 

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this _Section 8.05(b)_. If a firm offer is made to
settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third
Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to
_Section 8.05(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days after its receipt
of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Companys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 



59 Section 8.06 Payments. Subject to _Section 2.05_ above, once a Loss
is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its
obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, non-appealable
adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The parties
hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any
such obligations within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount
payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to the date such
payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to six percent. Such interest
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365)
day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

Section 8.08 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to _Section 5.12_ and _Section
10.11_, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from
fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Article VI_
and this _Article VIII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and Action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based
upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
_Article VI_ and this _Article VIII_. Nothing in this _Section 8.08_ shall
limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any partys
fraudulent, criminal or intentional misconduct.

terminates this Agreement by reason of the condition precedent in _Section

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement or material action or inaction by Seller or the Company, Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller the sum of $500,000 within two
Business Days of such termination, by bank draft or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, net of any
Taxes required to be withheld from such payment.

(b) The parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without those agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the payment amount set out in Section
9.03(a) is a payment of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of
the damages Seller will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise
to such payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement and are
not penalties. The parties irrevocably waive any right they may have to raise
as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive, and
the payment shall be in lieu of any other liabilities or damages in respect of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits mean the
Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits attached to,
this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such
agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified
from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof and (z)
to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. This
Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule
requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an
instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules
and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with, and as an integral
part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein.

Section 10.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.05 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect

 



64  any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render
unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Except as
provided in _Section 5.12(d)_, upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the sole and entire
agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter
contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
representations, warranties, understandings and agreements, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the other
Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

Section 10.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or

this Agreement to one or more of its direct or indirect wholly-owned

obligations hereunder.

6.03_ and _Article VIII_ , this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and

amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party
so waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver
in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.
