2.5 Assignment and Assumption of Contracts.

  

  

(a) Assignment and Assumption at Closing.

  

  

(i) Schedule 2.5(a) sets forth a list of all executory Contracts to which
Seller is a party and which Buyer has designated to be included in the
Acquired Assets (the "Assumed Contracts"), together with estimated Cure
Amounts for each Assumed Contract. From and after the date hereof until five
(5) Business Days prior to the Sale Hearing, Buyer shall be entitled to make
such additions and deletions to Schedule 2.5(a) by delivery of written notice
to Seller. Any such deleted Contract shall be deemed to no longer be an
Assumed Contract and any such added Contract shall be deemed an Assumed
Contract. All Contracts of Seller that are not listed on Schedule 2.5(a) shall
be "Rejected Contracts." Additionally, if Seller shall enter into any Contract
after the Execution Date upon the express written consent of Buyer, then Buyer
shall add such Contract to Schedule 2.5(a) as an Assumed Contract and Buyer
shall not delete such Contract from Schedule 2.5(a) without the express
written consent of Seller.

  

  

(ii) Seller shall provide timely and proper written notice of the procedures
for the assumption and assignment of Contracts to parties to all Contracts and
take all other actions necessary to cause all Assumed Contracts to be assumed
by Seller and assigned to Buyer, and all Rejected Contracts to be rejected by
Seller, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, provided that the only
Contracts to be actually assumed and assigned to Buyer at Closing will be the
Assumed Contracts. Buyer shall, at or prior to Closing, comply with all
requirements under Section 365 necessary to assign to Buyer the Assumed
Contracts (including, without limitation, by providing "adequate assurance of
future performance" (within the meaning of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code)).

  

  

(iii) At Closing, (x) Seller shall, pursuant to the Sale Order and the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement(s), assume and assign to Buyer (the
consideration for which is included in the Purchase Price) each of the Assumed
Contracts that are capable of being assumed and assigned and (y) Buyer shall
pay promptly all Cure Amounts (if any) in connection with such assumption and
assignment (as agreed to among Buyer and Seller or as determined by the
Bankruptcy Court) and assume and perform and discharge the Assumed Liabilities
(if any) under the Assumed Contracts, pursuant to the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement(s).

  

  

(b) Previously Omitted Contracts.

  

  

(i) If it is discovered that a Contract should have been listed on Schedule
4.5 but was not listed on Schedule 4.5 (any such Contract, a "Previously
Omitted Contract"), Seller shall, immediately following the discovery thereof
(but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the discovery
thereof), (x) notify Buyer of such Previously Omitted Contract and all Cure
Amounts (if any) for such Previously Omitted Contract, and (y) if requested by
Buyer, file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court on notice to the counterparties
to such Previously Omitted Contract seeking entry of an order (the "Omitted
Contract Order") fixing the Cure Amounts and approving the assumption and
assignment of such Previously Omitted Contract in accordance with this Section
2.5(b) (provided that no Previously Omitted Contract shall be assumed and
assigned unless such Previously Omitted Contract shall be designated by Buyer
as "Assumed" in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(i)).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) For purposes of the application of this Section 2.5, each Previously
Omitted Contract so designated as "Assumed" by Buyer shall be an Assumed
Contract, and each Previously Omitted Contract so designated as "Rejected"
shall be a Rejected Contract. Each Previously Omitted Contract shall then be
treated in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5 with respect to
Assumed Contracts and Rejected Contracts.

  

  

(c) Non-Assignment of Contracts and Permits. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Assumed Contract or any
Permit, if, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, an attempt at assignment or transfer thereof, without the
consent or approval of, or granting or issuance of any license or permit by,
any third party thereto (each such action, a "Necessary Consent"), would
constitute a breach thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer
thereunder. In such event, Seller and Buyer will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary Consents with respect to any such
Assumed Contract or Permit or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder for the assignment thereof to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably
request; provided, however, that Seller will not be obligated to pay any
consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested or to initiate any litigation or legal proceedings to obtain any
such consent or approval. If, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 363
and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code such Necessary Consent (not including any
approval under the HSR Act, if applicable) is not obtained, neither Seller nor
Buyer shall be in breach of this Agreement nor shall the Purchase Price be
adjusted nor (but subject to Buyer's termination right set forth in Section
11.1(d)(iii)) shall the Closing be delayed in respect of the Assumed Contracts
or the Permits; provided, however, if the Closing occurs, then, from and after
the Closing, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable arrangement
Buyer may request to provide Buyer with all of the benefits of, or under, the
applicable Assumed Contract or applicable Permit, including enforcement for
the benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller against any party to the
applicable Assumed Contract or applicable Permit arising out of the breach or
cancellation thereof by such party; provided, however, to the extent that any
such arrangement has been made to provide Buyer with the benefits of, or
under, the applicable Assumed Contract or applicable Permit, from and after
Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall promptly pay, (x) all costs
and expenses of Seller to establish, implement, monitor, maintain, execute on,
or carry into effect any such arrangement (including any costs and expenses
incurred in connection with enforcing rights under any such Assumed Contract
or Permit), and (y) all payment and other obligations under such Assumed
Contract or Permit (all of which shall constitute, and shall be deemed to be,
Assumed Liabilities hereunder) to the same extent as if such Assumed Contract
or Permit had been assigned or transferred at Closing with respect to Assumed
Contracts and Permits, and at such applicable later date specified in this
Section 2.5 with respect to any additional Assumed Contracts. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of Seller to
cooperate with Buyer set forth in this Section 2.5(c) shall (i) not require
Seller to incur any expenses, liabilities or obligations or to provide any
financial accommodation or to remain secondarily or contingently liable for
any liabilities or obligations under any applicable Assumed Contract or Permit
and (ii) terminate upon the closing of the Bankruptcy Case. Any assignment to
Buyer of any Assumed Contract or Permit that shall, notwithstanding the
provisions of Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, require the consent
or approval of any Person for such assignment as aforesaid shall be made
subject to such consent or approval being obtained.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

ARTICLE 3

  

  

CONSIDERATION

  

  

3.1 Deposit. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery by the parties of
this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall execute an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (with such changes as may be
reasonably required by the Escrow Agent, the "Deposit Escrow Agreement"), with
the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent
an amount equal to $7,500,000 (the "Deposit") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to be applied as provided in the following two sentences. The
Deposit shall be retained by Seller in the following two circumstances: (i) at
the Closing, at which time the Deposit shall be credited against the Cash
Purchase Price; or (ii) pursuant to Section 11.2. Except as described in the
previous sentence, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer after termination of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Deposit Escrow
Agreement, Seller shall be responsible to pay fees of the Escrow Agent and the
reasonable attorney's fees, disbursements and expenses of Escrow Agent, in
each case in connection with the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

  

  

3.2 Other Escrow Funds. At Closing, Seller and Buyer shall execute an escrow
agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (with such changes as
may be reasonably required by the Escrow Agent, the "503(b)(9) Escrow
Agreement"), with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which Buyer shall deposit with
the Escrow Agent an amount equal to $4,800,000 (the "503(b)(9) Escrow Fund")
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Also at Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall execute an escrow agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit
C hereto (with such changes as may be reasonably required by the Escrow Agent,
the "Purchase Price Escrow Agreement"), with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to
which Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to 7.5% of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price Escrow Fund") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. The 503(b)(9) Escrow Fund shall be
released by Escrow Agent to Seller only in accordance with the 503(b)(9)
Escrow Agreement and used to pay any administrative claims allowed pursuant to
Section 503(b)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code. On the eighteen (18) month
anniversary date of the Closing, the balance of the 503(b)(9) Escrow Fund, if
any, shall be released one-half to Buyer and one half to Seller. The Purchase
Price Escrow Fund shall be released by the Escrow Agent only in accordance
with this Agreement and the Purchase Price Escrow Agreement.

  

  

3.3 Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale of the Business and the
Acquired Assets to Buyer, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Business and
the Acquired Assets shall be: (a) $148,000,000 (the "Cash Purchase Price"),
plus (b) assumption of the Assumed Liabilities; provided, however, that the
Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for any
insurance proceeds received prior to Closing, other than Excess Insurance
Proceeds, in connection with casualty events involving tangible Acquired
Assets (other than Inventory) to the extent such proceeds are applied towards
the DIP Financing and permanently reduce the First Priority Obligations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

3.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Pre-Closing Estimate. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer at least
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing a certificate setting forth the
estimated Net Working Capital (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the
Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities) as of 11:59 P.M. on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with this
Agreement and in accordance with the Form Net Working Capital Statement (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital"), together with detailed calculations used by
Seller and copies of all working papers and supporting materials with respect
thereto. The Estimated Net Working Capital shall be prepared by Seller using
GAAP, consistently applied, and the same accounting principles, procedures,
policies and methods that were used to prepare the Financial Statements;
provided, however, that (i) Inventory shall in no event be valued at amounts
in excess of the Inventory values set forth in the document created as Section
18.1 of the Intralinks, Inc. virtual data room established in connection with
the transactions contemplated herein (relating to inventory detail as of
September 21, 2013), as such document was posted in such data room as of
December 13, 2013; (ii) amounts of Inventory for beets, carrots, potatoes and
dry beans that are not USDA extra standard or better shall not exceed
$2,500,000 in the aggregate, amounts of Inventory for corn, beans and peas
that are not USDA extra standard or better shall not exceed $4,600,000 in the
aggregate and all other Inventory that is not USDA extra standard or better
shall be valued at zero; (iii) the maximum value attributed to the portion of
Inventory other than raw products and finished goods shall in no event exceed
$16,000,000; and (iv) amounts of Inventory at Closing shall be calculated
based on the results of the Physical Inventory, as adjusted to reflect
transactions occurring between the date of the Physical Inventory and Closing.
Seller shall give Buyer access to all working papers and supporting materials
in order to confirm the Estimated Net Working Capital. The Seller's Estimated
Net Working Capital calculation shall be utilized for Closing purposes
(subject to adjustment after Closing as provided below in this Section 3.4),
except to the extent Buyer's review of such calculation identifies manifest
errors in Seller's calculation, in which event Seller's calculation shall be
modified to correct such manifest errors, and such revised calculation shall
be used as the Estimated Net Working Capital for Closing purposes (subject to
adjustment after Closing as provided below in this Section 3.4). The Cash
Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be (i) increased on a dollar for
dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the amount that is the Estimated
Net Working Capital is greater than the amount of the Target Net Working
Capital or (ii) reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by
which the amount that is the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than amount
of the Target Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Cash Purchase Price").

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Post-Closing Estimates. Within twenty (20) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth Buyer's calculation of the Net Working Capital (for
the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities) as of 11:59 P.M. on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, calculated in accordance with this Agreement and in accordance
with the Form Net Working Capital Statement (the "Closing Net Working
Capital"), together with detailed calculations used by Buyer and copies of all
working papers and supporting materials with respect thereto. Seller shall
have fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the Closing Statement and the
supporting detail (the "Review Period") to review the same. On or before the
expiration of the Review Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written
statement accepting or objecting to the Closing Statement (the "Closing
Statement Response Notice").

  

  

(c) Disputes. In the event that Seller objects to all or any portion of the
Closing Statement within the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly
meet and in good faith attempt to resolve such objections. Any such objections
which cannot be resolved between Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days
following Buyer's receipt of the Closing Statement Response Notice shall be
resolved in accordance with this Section 3.4(c). Should Seller and Buyer not
be able to resolve such objections set forth in the Closing Statement Response
Notice within the fifteen (15) day period described above, either party may
submit the matter to an accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Seller (the "Accounting Referee") for review and resolution, with instructions
to complete the same as promptly as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days of its engagement, and to resolve any objections consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, including making the calculations in
accordance with the definition of "Net Working Capital" as set forth in this
Agreement. The Accounting Referee shall only have authority to make
determinations in respect of those specific items for which an objection has
been raised in the Closing Statement Response Notice, and all determinations
shall be based solely on the presentations of Buyer and Seller and their
respective representatives, and not by independent review. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Referee: (i) shall be bound by the principles
set forth in this Section 3.4 and (ii) shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Accounting
Referee shall deliver a statement setting forth its resolution of the dispute
within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to such firm, which
resolution, absent manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive on the
parties and not subject to appeal. The Closing Statement shall be modified if
necessary to reflect such determination by the Accounting Referee. The fees
and costs of the Accounting Referee, if one is required, shall be payable by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amounts actually contested by Buyer and Seller, as determined by
the Accounting Referee.

  

  

(d) Determinations; Adjustments. If the Closing Net Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.4 is greater than the Estimated Net
Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess in
accordance with Section 3.4(e). If the Closing Net Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.4 is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, Seller shall pay Buyer the amount of such shortfall in accordance
with Section 3.4(e).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Payments. The amount (if any) owed to Seller, on the one hand, or to
Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 3.4(d) above shall be referred
to as the "Final Closing Adjustment." In the event that the Final Closing
Adjustment is owed to Buyer (the "Buyer Final Closing Adjustment"), then an
amount in cash equal to the Buyer Final Closing Adjustment shall be paid to
Buyer as follows: (i) first, by the payment to Buyer of the Purchase Price
Escrow Fund up to the amount of the Buyer Final Closing Adjustment; and (ii)
the balance of the Buyer Final Closing Adjustment, if any, still owing after
payment to Buyer pursuant to preceding clause (i), by Seller's payment to
Buyer of such balance. Any amount of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, if any,
remaining after payment to Buyer pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid to Seller. In the event that any portion of the Buyer
Final Closing Adjustment is to be paid by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the
above provisions of this Section 3.4(e), Buyer's right to receive such payment
shall be shall be a super-priority administrative expense priority obligation
under Section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code with priority over all expenses
of the kind specified in Sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code,
subject to any super-priority Claims of Seller's post-petition lenders and the
Carve-Out. In the event the Final Closing Adjustment is owed to Seller (the
"Seller Final Closing Adjustment"), Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in
cash equal to the Seller Final Closing Adjustment and the entire Purchase
Price Escrow Fund shall be delivered to Seller. Any payment required under
this Section 3.4(e) shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment.

  

  

3.5 Allocation of Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the "Allocation Statement") allocating, for tax purposes, the
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional purchase
price for tax purposes among the Acquired Assets. The Allocation Statement
shall be subject to the approval of Seller, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Allocation Statement shall be reasonable
and prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(b) The parties to this Agreement hereby agree to (i) be bound by the
Allocation Statement after Seller shall have approved it in writing, (ii) act
in accordance with the Allocation Statement in connection with the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including, without
limitation, in the filing of IRS Form 8594 and any other corresponding Tax

actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary or
proper, consistent with applicable Law, to consummate and make effective as
soon as possible the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Adequate Assurance Regarding Assumed Contracts and Required Orders. Buyer
agrees that it will cooperate as reasonably requested by Seller to assist in
establishing adequate assurance of future performance within the meaning of
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code with regard to the Assumed Contracts. Buyer
shall take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Seller to assist
Seller in obtaining the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the Sale Order and any
other order of the Bankruptcy Court reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Financing. Buyer shall ensure that, on the Closing Date, Buyer will have
sufficient funds to pay in full all of the Cure Amounts with respect to the
Assumed Contracts that are assumed and assigned to Buyer pursuant to Section
2.5(a). In addition, Buyer shall ensure that, on the Closing Date, Buyer will
have sufficient funds to pay in full the Purchase Price.

  

  

(d) Permits. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain or consummate the
transfer to Buyer of any Permit required to own or operate the Acquired Assets
under applicable Laws.

  

  

(e) Notice of Certain Events. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of, and
furnish Seller any information Seller may reasonably request with respect to,
any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 9.1 not to be fulfilled by the Termination Date.

  

  

6.3 Other Covenants of Seller and Buyer.

  

  

(a) Disclosure Schedules and Supplements. From time to time prior to the
Closing Date, Seller may supplement or amend the disclosure schedules (the
"Schedules") to this Agreement with respect to any matter. Each such
supplement or amendment shall include reasonable supporting information, to
the extent reasonably available to Seller. Unless Buyer delivers a notice of
termination with respect to such matter as contemplated by Section 11.1(d)(i)
(to the extent Buyer is entitled to deliver such notice pursuant to Section
11.1(d)(i), based on a determination that the matters referenced in such
supplement or amendment, when combined with any other breaches of Seller's
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
including any disclosed in any other supplements or amendments previously
delivered to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.3(a), entitle
Buyer to deliver a termination notice pursuant to Section 11.1(d)(i)) within
five (5) Business Days of the receipt by Buyer of any such supplement to the
Schedules pursuant to this Section 6.3(a), then Buyer will have automatically
be deemed to have waived (i) any and all rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1(d)(i) and (ii) the closing condition set forth in
Section 9.2(a), in each case arising out of Buyer's receipt of such
supplement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Personally Identifiable Information. Buyer shall honor and observe, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all
policies of Seller in effect on the Execution Date prohibiting the transfer of
personally identifiable information about individuals and otherwise comply
with the requirements of Section 363(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  

  

(c) Access to Records after Closing. From and after the Closing Date, each
party hereto shall provide the other parties hereto (and their respective
representatives) with access, at reasonable times and in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with their normal business, to the books and records
(including the Headquarters Site Computer Hardware) acquired pursuant to this
Agreement so as to enable (i) Seller to sell, transfer or dispose of any
Excluded Asset and wind down the Seller's estate pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Case and (ii) Buyer and Seller to prepare Tax, financial or court filings or
reports, to respond to court orders, subpoenas or inquiries, investigations,
audits or other proceedings of Governmental Authorities, and to prosecute and
defend legal Actions or for other like purposes, including Claims, objections
and resolutions. If any party desires to dispose of any such records, such
party shall, thirty (30) days prior to such disposal, provide the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to remove such records to be disposed of at the
removing party's expense. The obligations under this Section 6.3 shall
terminate upon the closing of the Bankruptcy Case.

  

  

(d) Environmental Claims after Closing. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
(and also on behalf of its Affiliates, successors and assigns) hereby
irrevocably releases and forever discharges Seller and each of its
subsidiaries and their respective directors, members, shareholders, officers,
employees and consultants, and their Affiliates, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Released Entities"), from any Liability based on any
Environmental Liabilities and Obligations and agrees that Buyer shall not sue
or pursue the Released Entities with respect to any Environmental Liabilities
and Obligations or seek to recover any amounts from the Released Entities for
any losses Buyer suffers arising out of or relating to any such Environmental
Liabilities and Obligations and shall not request or cause any third party to
take any such action. For purposes of clarity, Buyer and Seller agree that
this Section 6.3(d) shall not be construed to imply that by giving this
release Buyer has assumed any Liability based on any Environmental Liabilities
and Obligations pursuant to Section 2.3 or otherwise.

  

  

6.4 Employment Covenants and Other Undertakings.

  

  

(a) Employees. Seller shall, upon Buyer's request, permit Buyer access to any
employee records that Buyer may reasonably request in order to facilitate
Buyer's potential hiring of any or all of Seller's employees, including, but
not limited to, job descriptions, time records, and payroll data. At least two
weeks prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall permit Buyer, during business
hours in a manner not to unreasonably disturb the Seller's business, to
solicit employment applications from and interview for potential employment
any of Seller's employees. Seller agrees that the Buyer shall, any time after
the Effective Date, have the right to offer employment (to take effect on or
after the Closing Date) to any of Seller's employees at the Buyer's sole
discretion; provided, however, that this provision imposes no obligation on
any employee to accept employment with Buyer, nor does it impose any
obligation on the Buyer to offer employment to or retain any employee for any
length of time. Such offers of employment shall be on terms and conditions
which are consistent with Buyer's policies and procedures. Any Employees who
accept such offer of employment by Buyer effective as of the Closing Date are
referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." Seller shall deliver to Buyer
on or before the Closing Date all personnel files and employment records
relating to the Transferred Employees to the extent permitted by Law
(including completed I-9 forms and attachments with respect to all Transferred
Employees, except for such Employees as Seller certifies in writing are exempt
from such requirement).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Buyer Benefit Plans. Each Transferred Employee shall receive credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for purposes of
benefit accrual, under any defined benefit pension plan maintained by Buyer in
which the Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate, for service
with Seller to the same extent recognized by Seller under a comparable
Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) Forms W-2 and W-4. Seller and Buyer shall adopt the "standard procedure"
for preparing and filing IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements) and Forms W-4
(Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate) regarding the Transferred
Employees. Under this procedure, Seller shall keep on file all IRS Forms W-4
provided by the Transferred Employees for the period required by applicable
Law concerning record retention and Buyer will obtain new IRS Forms W-4 with
respect to each Transferred Employee.

  

  

(d) Employee Communications. Prior to making any written communications to the
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer
with a copy of the intended communication.

  

  

(e) WARN Obligations. Except to the extent provided below, Seller shall comply
with and be solely responsible for all obligations, if any, under the federal
Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, and any similar state or
local Laws (collectively, "WARN") with respect to any employment actions taken
on or before the Closing Date, all of which shall constitute Excluded
Liabilities. Seller may, in its sole discretion, issue appropriate WARN
notices related to the transactions contemplated hereby to its employees at
any time and from time to time. Seller shall, in accordance with all
applicable laws, terminate and discharge effective on the Closing Date all of
its employees engaged with respect to the Acquired Assets (the "Terminated
Employees"), with written notice of termination to each such employee, and pay
all costs and expenses associated with such terminations; provided, however,
that Buyer agrees to assume, and indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and
against, all obligations, if any, arising under WARN as a result of Seller's
termination of the employment of the Terminated Employees on the Closing Date
in accordance with the above provisions of this Section 6.4(e) (the "WARN
Liabilities"), except and to the extent that any such WARN Liabilities are
avoided as a result of Buyer's offer of employment to any of the Terminated
Employees as contemplated above (the "Assumed WARN Obligations").

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(f) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of Section
12.17, Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.4 are included for the sole benefit of Seller and Buyer, and
that nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without
limitation, any current or former employees, directors, officers or
consultants of Seller, any participant in any Employee Benefit Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Buyer
or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

6.5 Approvals.

  

  

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate
fully with the other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties shall not willfully take any
action that has, or is reasonably likely to have, the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make (or cause its ultimate
parent entities, as such term is used in the HSR Act, to make) an appropriate
filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Buyer's undertaking pursuant to this
Section 6.5, but subject to Section 6.5(d), Buyer agrees to use its reasonable
efforts and to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust, competition, trade regulation Law or
other Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible.

  

  

(c) Subject to Section 6.5(d), if required by a Governmental Authority in
order to obtain clearance under or to terminate any waiting period required by
the HSR Act or any antitrust, competition, trade regulation Law, Buyer will
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted,
commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate Order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of Acquired Assets or aspects of the
Business or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action
which it is capable of taking (collectively, a "Divestiture Action"), and if
the offer is accepted, take or commit to take, such action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
Acquired Assets or aspects of the Business. For purposes of this Section 6.5,
a Divestiture Action will be considered "required" by a Governmental Authority
only if and to the extent that Buyer has been notified by the such
Governmental Authority that the failure or refusal to take such Divestiture
Action would result in the filing of Legal Proceedings seeking an Order that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement will require, or be construed to require, Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, in order to obtain clearance under, or to terminate
any waiting period required by, any antitrust Law or to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any antitrust Order (whether or not the
foregoing would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond
the Termination Date) to:

  

  

(i) agree to any restriction, condition or limitation (including any sale,
divestiture, disposition, change in business practice or other transaction or
any requirement to hold separate) with respect to any asset, business or
property of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Assets or
the Business) or with respect to any asset, business or property which Buyer
or any of its Affiliates acquires or transfers or has or hereafter has an
unconsummated contract to acquire or to transfer (other than with respect to
the Acquired Assets or the Business); or

  

  

(ii) take or refrain from taking any action with respect to the acquisition,
sale, divestiture, disposition, change in business practice or other
transaction involving directly or indirectly any asset, business or property
of any other Person (other than the Acquired Assets or the Business) or in any
market (other than markets in which the Business is conducted, but only as to
the conduct of such Business).

  

  

(e) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
any party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
interactions between Seller and Governmental Authorities in the Ordinary
Course of Business or any disclosure which is not permitted by Law) shall be
disclosed to the other parties hereunder in advance of any filing, submission
or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each
party shall give notice to the other parties with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff
or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient
to provide the other parties with the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to disclose to Seller any commercially
sensitive materials pursuant to this Section 6.5 which, in Buyer's reasonable
judgment, is confidential or proprietary to Buyer or its business.

  

  

(f) The filing fees associated with the filings under the HSR Act shall be
borne solely by Buyer.

  

  

6.6 Physical Inventory Count. Seller shall engage third party firm acceptable
to Buyer to conduct a physical count of the Inventory (the "Physical
Inventory") for purposes of preparing the Estimated Net Working Capital under
Section 3.4(a) hereof. The Physical Inventory shall be completed no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Auction and, where feasible, shall be
conducted at times that Seller's facilities are closed in the Ordinary Course
of Business. Seller will give Buyer not less than two (2) days' notice of such
Physical Inventory. Representatives of Buyer will be permitted to observe such
physical inventory and will be permitted to make test counts of Inventory and
receive copies of the records and reconciliations of the Physical Inventory
conducted pursuant to this Section 6.6.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

6.7 Transition Services. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
regarding the terms of a transition services agreement to take effect upon
Closing pursuant to which Buyer shall provide Seller with access to
Transferred Employees retained by Buyer as may be reasonably required by
Seller in connection with the wind down of Seller's estate pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Case.

TAXES

  

  

7.1 Taxes Related to Purchase of Acquired Assets.

  

  

(a) All transfer, conveyance, recording and similar Taxes, including all such
state and local Taxes, incurred in connection with the transfer of the
Acquired Assets, and all recording and filing fees (collectively, "Transaction
Taxes"), that are imposed solely as a result of the sale, transfer, assignment
and delivery of the Acquired Assets shall be borne by Buyer. Notwithstanding
the time period in Section 3.4 relating to the Allocation Statement, Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate to (a) determine the amount of Transaction Taxes
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement,
and (b) prepare and file any and all required Tax Returns for or with respect
to such Transaction Taxes with any and all appropriate taxing authorities.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in providing each other with any appropriate
certification and other similar documentation relating to any exemption from

as provided under applicable Law

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 2.3(h), on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
pay all sales Taxes, use Taxes, payroll Taxes, and other Taxes which are then
due and owing by Seller (and not any member or owner thereof) with respect to
the Acquired Assets and the Business and attributable to Tax periods or
portions thereof commencing on or after the Petition Date and ending on the
Closing Date; provided, however, Seller shall not be obligated to pay any such
Tax that is disputed in good faith by Seller, as long as appropriate reserves
have been established in accordance with GAAP. Subject to Section 2.3(h), all
sales Taxes, use Taxes, payroll Taxes, real property Taxes, personal property
Taxes and other ad valorem Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets that
accrue during, or attributable to, the period on or prior to the Closing Date
and become due on or after the Closing Date shall be paid by Seller. Subject
to Section 7.1(a), all sales Taxes, use Taxes, payroll Taxes, real property
Taxes, personal property Taxes and other ad valorem Taxes with respect to the
Acquired Assets that both accrue and are due after the Closing Date shall be
paid by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and prepare and file any and
all required Tax Returns with respect to Taxes subject to this Section 7.1(b).
For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine the
liability for any such Taxes subject to this Section 7.1(b) for a taxable
period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including, and for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days during the Straddle Period before and including the Closing
Date, or the number of calendar days during the Straddle Period beginning the
day after the Closing Date, as applicable, and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

7.2 Waiver of Bulk Sales Laws. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable
Law, Buyer and Seller hereby waive compliance with the terms of any bulk sales
or similar Laws in any applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(c)(ii) shall not
be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date; or

  

  

(iii) if the Estimated Cash Purchase Price less the amount of the Purchase
Price Escrow Fund is less than the sum of (A) an amount equal to the First
Priority Obligations, (B) an amount equal to the Carve Out, (C) an amount
equal to the PACA Claims, (D) the estimated amount of unpaid priority wage
claims up to $100,000 and (E) an amount equal to the Lazard Fees, in each case
as estimated to be outstanding as of the Closing and determined as of the date
of the determination of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price.

  

  

(d) by Buyer:

  

  

(i) if Seller shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 9.2 and (B) is not curable or able to be
performed, or, if curable or able to be performed, is not cured or performed
prior to the then-applicable Termination Date;

  

  

(ii) if, prior to the Closing, Seller's Bankruptcy Case shall be converted
into a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or dismissed, or if a
trustee or examiner with expanded powers shall be appointed in the Bankruptcy
Case; or

  

  

(iii) if there shall be excluded from the Acquired Assets any Assumed Contract
that is not assignable or transferable pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise without the consent of any Person other than Seller, to the extent
that such consent shall not have been given prior to the Closing and the
exclusion of such Assumed Contract shall have a Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(e) by Seller if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 9.1 and (B) is not curable or able to be
performed, or, if curable or able to be performed, is not cured or performed
prior to the then-applicable Termination Date.

  

  

Each condition set forth in this Section 11.1 pursuant to which this Agreement
may be terminated shall be considered separate and distinct from each other
such condition. If more than one of the termination conditions set forth in
Section 11.1 are applicable, the applicable party shall have the right to
choose the termination condition pursuant to which this Agreement is to be
terminated. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no notice of
termination or extension of the Termination Date provided pursuant to this
Section 11.1 shall become effective until five (5) days after the delivery of
such notice to the other parties, and only if such notice shall not have been
withdrawn during such five (5) day period or otherwise become invalid.

  

  

11.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination pursuant to Section
11.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and have no effect and no
party hereto shall have any liability to the other parties hereto except (a)
nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement occurring prior to such termination and (b) with respect to the
provisions of ARTICLE 11 and ARTICLE 12 which shall expressly survive
termination hereof including the buyer protections provided for in Section
11.3; provided, that upon such termination, each of the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive and remain in full force and effect
for the longer of (x) the remainder of the term of survival applicable to such
provision as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) one (1) year
following such termination. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.1(e) (provided, that such termination must relate to the condition
set forth in Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b)), then Seller shall be entitled
to disbursement of the Deposit (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all
interest and other earnings accrued and earned thereon) as liquidated damages.
The parties expressly agree and acknowledge that it would be extremely
difficult or impracticable to ascertain the actual damages that would be
incurred by Seller in the event of a termination of this Agreement described
in the immediately preceding sentence and that the Deposit represents the
parties' reasonable estimate of the damages that would be incurred by Seller
in the event of any such termination of this Agreement.

  

  

11.3 Buyer Protections.

  

  

(a) So long as Buyer shall not be in material violation of its obligations
under this Agreement, if this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 11.1(b)(iii), then, a break-up fee (the "Break-Up Fee") in the amount
of $5,000,000 shall immediately become earned and due from Seller to Buyer and
the Expense Reimbursement shall immediately become earned and due from Seller
to Buyer.

  

  

(b) So long as Buyer shall not be in material violation of its obligations
under this Agreement, if this Agreement shall be terminated by Seller pursuant
to Section 11.1(c)(iii), then the Expense Reimbursement shall immediately
become earned and due from Seller to Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) The Expense Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee shall be a super-priority
administrative expense priority obligation under Section 364(c)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code with priority over all expenses of the kind specified in
Sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, subject to any super-
priority Claims of Seller's post-petition lenders and the Carve-Out.

  

  

(d) Buyer shall have no right to the Expense Reimbursement and the Break-Up
Fee if this Agreement shall be terminated other than as specified in Sections
11.3(a) and 11.3(b).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 11.3 to the contrary, the Expense
Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee shall be paid to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds upon (i) in the case of the Expense Reimbursement
in the event of a termination by the Seller under 11.1(c)(iii), the earlier of
(a) Seller's having available cash to pay the Expense Reimbursement (whether
in whole or in part) and (b) contemporaneous with the closing of an
Alternative Transaction and (ii) in the case of any other termination giving
rise to an obligation to pay such amounts, contemporaneous with the closing of
an Alternate Transaction.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement is earned by
Buyer pursuant to Section 11.3(a), the agreement evidencing the Alternate
Transaction shall provide that the Successful Bidder (as defined in the Bid
Procedure Order) shall pay the Expense Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee
directly to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available good funds to an
account specified by Buyer at the Closing of the Alternate Transaction. If for
any reason such Successful Bidder fails to pay the Break-Up Fee and Expense
Reimbursement directly to Buyer, Seller is authorized and directed to pay the
Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement to Buyer from the gross cash proceeds
of the Alternate Transaction without further order of the Court.

  

  

(g) In the event that any credit bid is determined to be the Successful Bid
(as defined in the Bid Procedure Order), such credit bid must include a
sufficient cash component at Closing of the Alternate Transaction or otherwise
provide Seller and its estates with sufficient cash to satisfy the Break-Up
Fee and Expense Reimbursement provided herein.

  

  

(h) The payment of the Break-Up Fee or Expense Reimbursement as provided
herein shall be free and clear of any Interest as defined herein that any
other person or entity may have or assert in such Alternate Transaction
proceeds or otherwise available cash.

  

  

(i) Seller hereby acknowledges that the obligation to pay the Expense
Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee (to the extent due hereunder) shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and shall have administrative priority
status against Seller and its estates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

ARTICLE 12

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

12.1 Survival. No representations or warranties of Seller or Buyer made in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements of
Seller and Buyer contained herein shall survive the Closing in accordance with
their terms.

  

  

12.2 Further Assurances. At the request and the sole expense of the requesting
party, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, such documents as Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
or their respective counsel may reasonably request to effectuate the purposes
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

12.3 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and any trustee appointed in any of the Bankruptcy Case or subsequent
chapter 7 cases and Seller, if the Bankruptcy Case are dismissed. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
transferred or assigned (including by operation of Law in connection with a
merger or sale of stock, or sale of substantially all the assets, of a Person)
by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
party or parties hereto (which consent may be granted, withheld, conditioned
or delayed in such other party's sole and absolute discretion), and any
attempted assignment in contravention or breach of the foregoing shall be void
and of no force or effect; provided, that no consent shall be required in
connection with any assignment by any party hereto of its rights under this
Agreement to its lenders.

  

  

12.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed, performed
and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the Laws of the State of New
York (without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof),
except to the extent that the Laws of such State are superseded by the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable federal Law. For so long as Seller is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties irrevocably
elect, as the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of any matters arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and consent as to the foregoing to
the exclusive jurisdiction of, the Bankruptcy Court. After Seller is no longer
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties irrevocably
elect, as the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of any matters arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and consent to the jurisdiction
of, any state or federal court having competent jurisdiction in New York, New
York.

  

  

12.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall pay its own expenses in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any legal and accounting
fees and commissions or finder's fees, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated.

  

  

12.6 Severability. In the event that any part of this Agreement is declared by
any court or other judicial or administrative body to be null, void or
unenforceable, a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision, said provision
shall survive to the extent it is not so declared, and all of the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect only if,
after excluding the portion deemed to be unenforceable and the application of
any provision so substituted, the remaining terms shall provide for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in substantially the same
manner as originally set forth at the later of (a) the Execution Date and (b)
the date (if any) this Agreement was last amended.

of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may
be waived, only by a written instrument executed by Buyer and Seller, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party hereto waiving compliance. Any waiver by
any party hereto of any condition, or of the breach of any provision, term,

or more instances, shall not be deemed to be or construed as a furthering or
continuing waiver of any such condition, or of the breach of any other
provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

12.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the schedules and exhibits attached
hereto and thereto and the instruments referenced herein and therein (all of
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference), supersede all other prior
oral or written agreements among the parties hereto solely with respect to the
matters contained herein and therein, and this Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the Ancillary Agreements and the schedules and
exhibits attached hereto and thereto and the instruments referenced herein and
therein, contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto solely with
respect to the matters contained herein and therein. For clarification
purposes, the Recitals are part of this Agreement.

  

  

12.10 Seller Disclosures. After notice to and consultation with Buyer, Seller
shall be entitled to disclose, if required by applicable Law or by order of
the Bankruptcy Court, this Agreement and all information provided by Buyer in
connection herewith to the Bankruptcy Court, the United States Trustee,
parties in interest in the Bankruptcy Case and other Persons bidding on assets
of Seller. Other than statements made in the Bankruptcy Court (or in pleadings
filed therein), Seller shall not issue (prior to, on or after the Closing) any
press release or make any public statement or public communication without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, however, Seller, without the prior consent of Buyer, may
issue such press release or make such public statement as may, upon the advice
of counsel, be required by applicable Law or any Governmental Authority with
competent jurisdiction.

  

  

12.11 Headings. The article and section headings in this Agreement are for

this Agreement.

  

  

12.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and
delivered to each other party. In the event that any signature is delivered by
facsimile transmission or by an e-mail which contains a portable document
format (.pdf) file of an executed signature page, such signature page shall
create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose
behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such
signature page were an original thereof.

  

  

12.13 Name Change. Immediately following the Closing, Seller shall discontinue
the use of its current name (and any other trade names currently utilized by
Seller) and shall not subsequently change its name to or otherwise use or
employ any name which includes the words "Allens," "Allens Canning," and/or
"All Veg" without the prior written consent of Buyer, and Seller shall cause
the name of Seller in the caption of the Bankruptcy Case to be changed to the
new names of Seller as provided in the last sentence of this Section 12.13.
From and after the Closing, Seller covenants and agrees not to use or
otherwise employ any of the trade names, corporate names, "d/b/a" names or any
mark that is confusingly similar to the Intellectual Property rights utilized
by Seller in the conduct of the Business, which rights shall be included in
the Acquired Assets purchased hereunder. Seller hereby irrevocably authorizes
Buyer to file, immediately following the Closing, the organizational
amendments with the applicable Secretary of State of Seller's jurisdiction of
formation and in each State in which Seller is qualified to do business on
Seller's behalf.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

12.14 Payments and Revenues. If after the Closing, either party shall receive
any payment, revenue or other amount that belongs to the other party pursuant
to this Agreement, such receiving party shall promptly remit or cause to be
remitted the same to the other party.

  

  

12.15 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity.

  

  

12.16 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED
UPON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER
IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED
IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, ANTITRUST CLAIMS,
BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON-LAW OR STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH
PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS
RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS
THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS OWN CHOOSING, OR
HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS, HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED
EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT
AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT. IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A
TRIAL BY THE COURT WITHOUT A JURY.

  

  

12.17 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is intended for the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by,
any other Person.
