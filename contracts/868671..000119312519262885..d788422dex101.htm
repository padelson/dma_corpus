Recital

Plan and Agreement of Merger, dated September 30, 2019 (the "Merger

Agreement



   1. |

Voting of Shares. Shareholder is the holder of shares constituting in excess
of 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of SBC. By signing
below, Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to vote or cause to
be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) at any
shareholder meeting of SBC, or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
including any meeting called for the purpose of approving the Merger Agreement
(a "SBC Meeting"), all shares of SBC common stock that such Shareholder owns
of record or beneficially, or acquires after the date hereof but prior to the
record date, in either case with power to vote or direct the voting of such
shares (collectively, the "Owned Shares"), (a) in favor of (i) approval of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the
Merger, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later
date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement, and
(b) against any action, proposal, transaction, or agreement that would
reasonably be likely to (i) result in a breach of any covenant,
representation, or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of SBC
contained in the Merger Agreement, or of the Shareholder contained in this
Agreement, or (ii) materially prevent, impede, interfere with, delay, or
frustrate the purposes of or materially and adversely affect the completion of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments apply to any Owned
Shares held by any trust, limited partnership, limited liability company,
corporation, or other entity holding shares of SBC common stock for which the
Shareholder serves in any partner, member, shareholder, or trustee capacity.
To the extent the Shareholder does not control, by himself or herself, the
determinations of such shareholder entity, the Shareholder agrees to exercise
all voting or other determination rights the Shareholder has in such
shareholder entity to carry out the intent and purposes of the Shareholders
voting obligations under this Section 1 and as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement.

       2. |

No Solicitation. Solely in his or her capacity as a record or beneficial owner
of the Owned Shares, Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of this
Agreement, Shareholder shall not knowingly, and shall direct his or her
advisors and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any of
the actions specified in Section 4.1.10 of the Merger Agreement, or (b)
participate in, directly or indirectly, a solicitation of proxies or powers of
attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person
with respect to the voting of, any shares of SBC common stock in connection
with any vote or other action on any matter of a type described in Section 1
hereof, other than to recommend that shareholders of SBC vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and as otherwise expressly
permitted by this Agreement. Shareholder agrees immediately to cease and cause
to be terminated any activities, discussions, or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than GBCI
and Glacier Bank with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) and will take all necessary steps to inform any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other
representative retained by Shareholder of the obligations undertaken by
Shareholder pursuant to this Section 2\. 

---|--- 



   3. |

Ownership. On the date of this Agreement, Shareholder represents and warrants,
severally but not jointly, that the Owned Shares set forth on such
Shareholders signature page (a) are owned of record or beneficially by the
Shareholder in the manner reflected thereon, (b) include all of the shares of
SBC common stock owned of record or beneficially by the Shareholder as of the
date hereof, and (c) are free and clear of any proxy or voting restriction,
claims, liens, encumbrances, and security interests, except (if applicable) as
set forth on the Shareholders signature page, which encumbrances or other
items do not affect the ability of the Shareholder to perform his or her
obligations under this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
Shareholder has, and at any SBC Meeting Shareholder will have (except as
otherwise permitted by this Agreement), sole voting power and sole dispositive
power with respect to all of the Shareholders Owned Shares, except as
otherwise reflected on the Shareholders signature page.  

---|--- 



   4. |

Proxy. 

---|--- 



     | a. |

_Appointment of Proxy_. In order to better effect the provisions set forth in
Section 1, Shareholder revokes any previously executed proxies and
constitutes and appoints Brian M. Riley with full power of substitution,
Shareholders true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (the "Proxy Holder")
to vote at any SBC Meeting all of Shareholders Owned Shares as provided in
Section 1, with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties to
the Merger Agreement may make; _provided_ , _however_ , that this proxy will
not apply with respect to any vote on the Merger Agreement if the Merger
Agreement is amended so as to reduce the amount or form of consideration to
be received by the shareholders of SBC or change the tax consequences of the
receipt thereof under the Merger Agreement in its present form. This
irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon termination of this
Agreement _._ 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 2 -

         | b. |

_Substitute_. If for any reason the Proxy Holder becomes unable to perform his
duties as Proxy Holder under this Agreement, Shareholder appoints James E.
Baker ("Substitute") as substitute proxy to act as the Proxy Holder and vote
all of Shareholders Owned Shares at any SBC Meeting as provided in Section 1,
with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties to the Merger
Agreement may make; _provided_ , _however_ , that this proxy will not apply
with respect to any vote on the Merger Agreement if the Merger Agreement is
amended so as to reduce the amount or form of consideration to be received by
the shareholders of SBC or change the tax consequences of the receipt thereof
under the Merger Agreement in its present form. Notwithstanding the above, the
Proxy Holder may from time to time, in his discretion, appoint any other
substitute proxy to act as the Proxy Holder upon prior written notice to GBCI
and SBC. 

---|---|--- 



   5. |

Acknowledgments. Shareholder acknowledges that GBCI and SBC are relying on
this Agreement in incurring expenses in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the proxy granted under this
Agreement is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. The vote of the Proxy Holder (and upon
substitution, the Substitute under Section 4.b.) will control in any conflict
between such vote of the Owned Shares and a vote by any substitute proxy
holder or the Shareholder, and SBC agrees to recognize the vote of the
Proxy Holder or upon substitution, the Substitute. 

---|--- 



   6. |

No Transfer. Until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.i.,
Shareholder will not sell, transfer, permit a lien or other encumbrance to be
created with respect to, or grant any proxy in respect of (except for proxies
solicited by the board of directors of SBC in connection with the SBC Meeting
at which the Merger Agreement is presented for shareholder approval) any of
the Owned Shares, unless all other parties to any such sale or other
transaction enter into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to GBCI
embodying the benefits and rights contained in this Agreement.

   7. |

Miscellaneous. 

---|--- 
 



     | a. |

_Binding Effect_. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and will be
binding upon, Shareholders heirs or legal representatives. 

---|---|--- 



     | b. |

_Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such
provision to any person or circumstances will be held invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or
application will be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid or
unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons or
circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and the
remainder of this Agreement, will not be affected. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | c. |

_Reformation_. If any court determines that the obligations and restrictions
set forth in this Agreement are unenforceable, then the parties request such
court to reform any unenforceable provisions to the maximum obligations or
restrictions, term, and scope, as applicable, that such court finds
enforceable. 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 3 -

         | d. |

expenses.

     | e. |

_Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed (i)
in the case of an amendment, by GBCI and the Shareholder to be bound by such
amendment and (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege.

     | f. |

_Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, except to the extent that

Kalispell, Montana or the federal district courts of the Missoula Division
for the State of Montana. Each party consents to and submits to the
jurisdiction of any such court.

     | g. |

_Remedies_. Any breach of this Agreement entitles GBCI to injunctive relief
and/or specific performance, as well as to any other legal or equitable
remedies it may be entitled to, it being agreed that money damages alone would
be an inadequate remedy for such breach. The rights and remedies of the
parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.

hereof and shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the
