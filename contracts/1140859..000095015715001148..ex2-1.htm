without any action on the part of any party:

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ ) and all rights in respect thereof, shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,

voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall
have properly demanded and are entitled to appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the

the appraised value of such shares of Common Stock held by them in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting
Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise are not entitled to appraisal of

Surviving Corporation for payment to each Optionholder from the Purchase Price

the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or this Agreement and any such further

Stockholder. The Company and the Representative shall comply with the

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will mail or will cause to
be mailed to each record holder of Certificates a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates prior to, on or within thirty (30)
calendar days following the Closing Date, as applicable, to the
Representative, and instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates and
receiving the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of the
Common Stock evidenced thereby. Upon the surrender of each such Certificate or
a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, as applicable,
and promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall pay the holder of such Certificate an amount from the Fully-Diluted
Stockholder Proceeds as determined in accordance with _Section 2.10(b)_, in
consideration therefor, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares or Certificates representing Common Stock held
by the Company or a Subsidiary or held in the treasury of the Company which
shall be canceled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_) shall
represent solely the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration (and, if any, the Post-Closing Payments) relating thereto.

  


 

  

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Representative, they shall be
surrendered and canceled as provided in this _Article II_.

  


 

  

(iii) Other than under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, no interest shall accrue or be paid on the
cash payable upon the delivery of Certificates or Letters of Transmittal. None
of the Representative, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be liable to a Common Stockholder or Optionholder
for any cash or interest thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by Optionholders one (1) year after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(iv) The Representative will deliver or will cause to be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation copies of all surrendered Certificates and Letters of
Transmittal on the Closing Date. After the Effective Time, any Common
Stockholders and any Optionholders will be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their respective claims for the
consideration set forth in this _Section 2.10_, without interest thereon, but
will have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, than may be accorded to general creditors thereof under applicable Law.

  


 

  


 

  

 

21  

  


 

  


 

  

(v) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such Certificate
to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_; _provided_ ,
that the Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a condition precedent
to the payment thereof, indemnify the Representative, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Representative,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  


 

  

(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement any withholding
or stock transfer Taxes and such other amounts as are required under the Code
or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law (collectively,
the " _Withholding Taxes_ "). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the respective holder of the
Certificate or Option or other person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made, and the Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, shall provide to the respective holder of such Certificate or
Option or other person written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld.
Any amounts so withheld shall be applied by the Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to satisfy Withholding Taxes. The
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall remit
any such amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment to the applicable
Taxing Authority.

  


 

  

(vii) If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered certificate of Common Stock is registered, it shall be a condition
to such payment that the certificate of Common Stock so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not payable.

anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement
consisting of the Company's good faith estimates of the following amounts: (
_i_ ) an estimated calculation of the Closing Cash Amount (the " _Estimated
Closing Cash Amount_ "), ( _ii_ ) an estimated calculation of the Seller
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Seller
Transaction Expenses_ "), ( _iii_ ) an estimated calculation of the Closing
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), ( _iv_ ) an estimated

and the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, ( _v_ ) an estimated calculation
of the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount (the " _Estimated Transaction Tax
Benefit Amount_ ") and ( _vi_ ) a calculation of the Estimated Merger

submit any objections in writing to the Company until 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date and the Company
will cooperate in good-faith with Parent to revise the draft statement to
reflect the mutual agreement of the Company and Parent with respect to the
estimated amounts set forth in the preceding sentence (as so revised and
agreed, the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ "); _provided_ , that if the Company and
Parent cannot reach an agreement with respect to the amounts set forth in the
preceding sentence, the Pre-Closing Statement will reflect the Company's good-
faith estimates with respect to such amounts. The Estimated Merger
Consideration shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.11_
(as adjusted, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Estimated Closing Cash
Amount and the Estimated Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with
the Applicable Accounting Principles.

  


 

  


 

  

 

22  

  


 

  


 

  

(b) _Closing Statement_. Within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement (the
" _Closing Statement_ ") consisting of ( _i_ ) a calculation of the Closing
Cash Amount, ( _ii_ ) a calculation of the Seller Transaction Expenses, (
_iii_ ) a calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, ( _iv_ ) a calculation of
Closing Working Capital (the " _Final Working Capital_ ") and the Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, ( _v_ ) a calculation of the Transaction Tax
Benefit Amount and ( _vi_ ) a calculation of the amount, if any, payable
pursuant to _Section 2.11(i)_. The Closing Cash Amount and the Final Working
Capital shall be prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting
Principles. Parent shall provide the Representative with reasonable supporting
documentation as requested to facilitate its review of the Closing Statement.

  


 

  

(c) _Dispute Notice_. The Closing Statement shall become final, binding and
conclusive upon Parent and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders on the sixtieth
(60th) calendar day following the Representative's receipt of the Closing
Statement, unless prior to such sixtieth (60th) calendar day the
Representative has delivered to Parent a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_
") stating that the Representative believes the Closing Statement contains
mathematical errors or was not prepared in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles or the terms of this Agreement and specifying in
reasonable detail each item that the Representative disputes (each, a "
_Disputed Item_ "), and to the extent the Representative is reasonably able to
so specify, the amount in dispute for each Disputed Item and the reasons
supporting the Representative's positions. If the Representative delivers a
Dispute Notice and Parent does not deliver to the Representative, within ten
(10) Business Days following the receipt by Parent of such Dispute Notice, a
written notice (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") stating that Parent disputes
all or any of the Disputed Items specified in such Dispute Notice, specifying
in reasonable detail each Disputed Item that Parent disputes, the amount in
dispute for each such Disputed Item and the reasons supporting Parent's
positions, Parent shall be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the changes to
the Closing Statement set forth in the Dispute Notice.

  


 

  


 

  

 

23  

  


 

  


 

  

(d) _Resolution Period_. If the Representative delivers a Dispute Notice and,
within ten (10) Business Days following the receipt by Parent of such Dispute
Notice, Parent delivers to the Representative a Notice of Disagreement with
respect to all or any of the Disputed Items specified in such Dispute Notice,
then the Representative and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Items during the fifteen (15) Business Day period beginning on the
date the Representatives receives the Notice of Disagreement (such period, the
" _Resolution Period_ "). If the Representative and Parent reach agreement
with respect to any Disputed Items, Parent shall revise the Closing Statement
to reflect such agreement.

  


 

  

(e) _Independent Accountant_. If the Representative and Parent are unable to
resolve all of the Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then the
Representative and Parent shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved
Disputed Items (the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to the Independent Accountant,
_provided_ that if the Representative and Parent do not appoint an Independent
Accountant within ten (10) calendar days after the end of the Resolution
Period, they shall request the American Arbitration Association to appoint as
the Independent Accountant a partner in the New York office of a nationally
recognized independent registered public accounting firm that has not had a
material relationship with the Representative, Parent or the Company within
the preceding two (2) years, and such appointment shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Representative and Parent. The Independent Accountant shall
act as an expert, and not as an arbitrator, to determine, based solely on
presentations by the Representative and Parent and not by independent review,
only whether the Unresolved Items that were properly included in the Dispute
Notice were prepared without mathematical errors and in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Principles and the terms of this Agreement. The parties
shall agree, promptly after the Independent Accountant has been appointed, on
procedures governing the resolution of any dispute by the Independent
Accountant, _provided_ that if the parties fail to agree on such procedures,
the dispute resolution procedures determined by the Independent Accountant
shall govern. The Representative and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue its written determination
regarding the Unresolved Items within thirty (30) calendar days after such
items are submitted for review. The Independent Accountant shall make a
determination with respect to the Unresolved Items only and in a manner
consistent with this _Section 2.11_ and the Applicable Accounting Principles,
and in no event shall the Independent Accountant's determination of the
Unresolved Items be for an amount that is outside the range of Parent's and
the Representative's disagreement. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other
documents and information pertaining to the Unresolved Items as the
Independent Accountant may reasonably request. The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Representative and Parent absent manifest error, and Parent shall revise the
Closing Statement to reflect such determination upon receipt thereof. The
fees, expenses and costs of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally
by Parent and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, with the portion to be borne by
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders being paid solely out of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account.

  


 

  

(f) _Access to Information_. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide promptly to the other party all information and reasonable access
to employees as such other party shall reasonably request in connection with
review of the Pre-Closing Statement, the Closing Statement, the Dispute Notice
or the Notice of Disagreement, as the case may be, including all work papers
of the accountants who audited, compiled or reviewed such statements or
notices (subject to the Representative and its representatives entering into
any undertakings required by Parent's accountants in connection herewith), and
shall otherwise cooperate in good faith with such other party to arrive at a
final determination of the Closing Statement.

of in accordance with this Agreement, all of the material Assets shall be

(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that could reasonably be construed, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No person is entitled to receive any
additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment) from the
Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the imposition of the excise taxes

make the officers and employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries available
to Parent and Merger Sub and their representatives as Parent, Merger Sub and
their representatives shall from time to time reasonably request, in each case

supplier or other material business relation of the Company or the
Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not prevent (i)

54  

  


 

  


 

  

5.4 _Efforts_.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law ( _i_ ) to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable
best efforts to obtain or make all necessary or appropriate filings required
under applicable Law, ( _ii_ ) to lift any injunction or other legal bar to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (
_iii_ ) to cause the waiting periods, approvals or other requirements under
the HSR Act and all other Competition Laws to terminate or expire or be
obtained as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
including by seeking "early termination" under the HSR Act. None of the
parties shall knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken any action which
would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Specified
Permit Assurances and any consents required pursuant to the Material Contracts
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
the Company in such efforts. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, (i) nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate
the Company or any of its Affiliates to make, or to cause to be made, any
payment to any third party in order to obtain the consent or approval of such
third party under any Material Contract or otherwise and (ii) the actual
receipt of any such required consents or approvals (other than as contemplated
by _Sections 6.3_ and _7.3_ ) shall not be a condition to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  


 

  

 

55  

  


 

  


 

  

(c) The Company and Parent will, within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ")
and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ ") the notification and report forms required for the transactions
contemplated hereby, and subsequent to such filings, any supplemental
information that may be requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act, which notification and report forms and supplemental information will
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of
Parent and the Company will promptly furnish to the other (x) all necessary
information as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any filing or submission pursuant to the HSR Act and (y) copies
of all written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of
any oral communication) with the FTC or the DOJ in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent reasonably
practicable and permitted by Law, each of Parent and the Company will consult
with the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the
staff of the FTC or the DOJ in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each of Parent and the Company will have the right to
have a representative present at any such meeting to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority. Parent shall pay all filing fees required with
respect to the notification, report and other requirements of the HSR Act.

  


 

  

(d) The parties shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
or requests for documentation or information or any request for additional
information (a "second request") received from the FTC or the DOJ and to all
inquiries and requests received from any other Governmental Authority in
connection with Competition Law matters, and (ii) use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Competition Laws and to cause the waiting periods, approvals or
other requirements under the HSR Act and all other Competition Laws to
terminate or expire or be obtained at the earliest possible date.

  


 

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party to this
Agreement shall: (i) cooperate fully with the other parties hereto, shall
execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and
instruments and shall take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by any other party hereto to evidence or reflect the Merger (including the
execution and delivery of all documents, certificates, agreements and
instruments reasonably necessary for all filings hereunder); (ii) give all
notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain each approval, consent,
ratification, permission, waiver or authorization required to be obtained by
such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including as may be necessary to allow the
Company and the Subsidiaries to continue to utilize the Permits following the
Effective Time); and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to provide such assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Authority or other Person whose consent or
approval is sought hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best
efforts" shall not include nor require either party or its subsidiaries to (A)
sell, or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose
or agree to dispose of any asset, in each case if such sale, separation or
disposition or agreement with respect thereto would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such
party, (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business in any particular manner
if such conduct or agreement with respect thereto would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such
party or (C) agree to any order, action or regulatory condition of any
regulatory body, whether in an approval proceeding or another regulatory
proceeding, that, if effected, would cause a material reduction in the
expected benefits to Parent of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated this Agreement (any of the foregoing effects, a " _Burdensome
Effect_ "). In the event that any action or proceeding is threatened or
instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Law, Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid or resolve such action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be required to take any action
that constitutes a Burdensome Effect. The parties shall take reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

  


 

  


 

  

 

56  

  


 

  


 

  

5.5 _Maintenance of Insurance_. The Company and the Subsidiaries will continue
to carry their existing insurance through the Closing, and shall not allow any
material breach, default or cancellation (other than expiration and
replacement of policies in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice) by the Company or the Subsidiaries of such insurance policies
or agreements that are material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, to occur or exist without the consent of Parent.

  


 

  

5.6 _Supplemental Information_. From time to time prior to the Closing, the
Company will promptly disclose in writing to Parent any matter hereafter
arising of which it has Knowledge, which, if existing, occurring or known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed to Parent
or which would render inaccurate any of the representations, warranties or
statements set forth in _Article III_ hereof in any material respect. No
information provided pursuant to this _Section_ 5.6 shall be deemed to cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made in this
Agreement.

  


 

  

5.7 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access and Cooperation; Litigation
Support_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date or such other period
(if longer) required by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall
preserve and retain all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human
resources and other books and records of the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries (including any documents relating to any governmental or non-
governmental Litigation) relating to the conduct of the business and
operations of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with the policies of Parent with respect to
document preservation and retention; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall preserve and retain all such books, records and
documents related to any matters that are the subject of a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ until the final resolution of such
claim.

  


 

  

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, after the Closing Date, afford
promptly to the Representative reasonable access during normal business hours
to the offices, facilities, books, records, officers and employees of the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably requested
by the Representative in connection with any tax-reporting matters, including
on behalf of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder, _provided_ that such access shall
not obligate the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary to take any actions
that would unreasonably disrupt the normal course of their businesses or
violate any applicable Law.

  


 

  


 

  

 

57  

  


 

  


 

  

5.8 _Employees and Benefits_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing until September
30, 2016, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to, continue to provide all persons who are employed by the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (including those on
temporary layoffs or approved leaves of absence) (" _Employees_ ") with
salary, annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the salary, annual bonus opportunity and
employee benefits (excluding for all purposes equity-based compensation) being
provided to each such Employee immediately before the Closing Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any plan,
program or arrangement or terminating any Employee, and _provided_ , _further_
, that nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

(b) In any termination or layoff of any Employee by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation on or after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
comply fully, if applicable, with the WARN Act and all other applicable
foreign, federal, state and local Laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and requiring notice to employees. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is
terminated, at the request of Parent, which shall not occur more frequently
than on a bi-weekly basis, the Company shall provide to Parent within seven
(7) calendar days of Parent's request a written schedule that reflects (i) the
number of employees of the Company who have experienced during such period an
"employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) and (ii) the title, position
and employment of each such employee of the Company. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to not, and to cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to not, at any time prior to sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms
are defined in the WARN Act, affecting in whole or in part any facility, site
of employment, operating unit or employee of the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries without complying fully with the requirements of the WARN Act.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will bear the cost of compliance with (or
failure to comply with) any such Laws.

  


 

  

(c) For periods on and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries shall continue to have all obligations and liabilities under
and with respect to the Benefit Plans and to or with respect to all persons
entitled to benefits under the provisions of each such Benefit Plan in
accordance with their terms and subject to the provisions of this _Section
5.8_.

  


 

  

(d) This _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.8_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.8_.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

  


 

  


 

  

 

58  

  


 

  


 

  

(e) Parent and the Company agree to the matters set forth in Section 5.8(e) of
the Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements or disclosures with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the terms hereof, and no party shall, without the
prior written consent of the other parties (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any such press release
or make any such public statement, except as may be required by applicable
Law.

  


 

  

5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  


 

  

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
officers and directors of the Company and of the Subsidiaries to the same
extent such persons are currently indemnified by the Company and the
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company's and the Subsidiaries' Organizational
Documents and any indemnification agreements set forth on Section 5.10 of the
Disclosure Letter as in effect on the date hereof for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and for such period of time
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Corporation's or a Subsidiary's Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of present and former officers and directors as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) as required by
applicable Law or (ii) unless the provisions as so amended, repealed or
modified in connection with a restructuring in which the governing documents
of the Surviving Corporation include substantially equivalent exculpation or
indemnification provisions with respect to such acts or conduct for the
benefit of such persons ( _provided_ that the officers and directors of the
Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled for such six-year
period to exculpation and indemnification under such provisions of the
Company's and the Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents as in effect on the
date hereof with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time).

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to
maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Closing Date directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered
by the Company's and the Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time ("
_D andO Insurance_") on terms not less favorable than such existing insurance
coverage; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall
not be required, and Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries, to pay for the DandO Insurance in an annual
amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
currently paid as of the date hereof by the Company and the Subsidiaries for
such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company and the Subsidiaries may, and at Parent's request
shall, prior to the Effective Time and at Parent's expense, purchase run-off
directors' and officers' liability insurance; _provided_ that payment for such
insurance coverage provided by such run-off directors' and officers' insurance
policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
currently paid as of the date hereof by the Company and the Subsidiaries for
such insurance. If the cost of such run-off insurance would require an
expenditure that exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Any such
"tail" directors' and officers' insurance and indemnification policy will
satisfy Parent's obligation under this _Section 5.10_ ( _b_ ) to provide DandO
Insurance; _provided_ that in the event that any claim is brought under such
DandO Insurance, the policy shall be maintained until final disposition thereof.

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall expressly
assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10._

foreign Tax Returns that include the business and operations of the Company
and the Subsidiaries and ( _ii_ ) any audit or examination by any Taxing
Authority of the Tax Returns referred to in clause (i). Such cooperation shall
include the furnishing or making available of employees on a mutually
convenient basis and records, books of account or other materials of the
Company and the Subsidiaries necessary or helpful for the defense against
assertions of any Taxing Authority as to any Tax Returns referred to in clause
(i) above.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or any
other instrument or agreement delivered in connection herewith, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required to provide a copy of, or otherwise disclose the
contents of, any consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or aggregate Tax
Return or any related document to any person, except to the extent such Tax
Return or document relates solely to the Company and the Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

5.12 _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local and foreign transfer, excise,
sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, recording, property and similar
Taxes or fees (other than Withholding Taxes) imposed as a result of the Merger
(the "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by each of Parent and
the Representative (on behalf of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders).

  


 

  

5.13 _Section 280G Stockholder Approval_. If it is reasonably expected that,
absent the vote described below, there would be an imposition of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to, reasonably in advance of the Closing Date, deliver
to its stockholders a disclosure statement in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, which satisfies the Company's disclosure obligations under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and which solicits
and recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the transactions
disclosed therein through a vote meeting the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and shall not make
any such payments or provide any such benefits that are subject to such vote
and are not so approved. The Company shall provide Parent and its
representatives with a copy of such disclosure statement within a reasonable
time prior to delivery to the Company's stockholders for Parent's approval,
with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

amend to exclude the Company and any Subsidiary as a party thereto, all
Affiliate Agreements other than those Affiliate Agreements set forth on

appraisal notice.

  


 

  

5.17 _Financing_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
agents and other representatives (collectively, the " _Company
Representatives_ ") to, at Parent's sole expense, provide any cooperation that
is reasonably necessary and customary and reasonably requested by Parent to
assist Parent in the arrangement of any bank financing for the purpose of
financing the Merger, the fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Debt Financing_ "),
including assisting with the preparation of materials for presentations,
memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the
Company's and the Subsidiaries' respective businesses, (B) require the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives to pay any
fees or expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities
prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent any such fee or expense is
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or Parent has advanced the
amount of such fees, expenses or liabilities to the Company or the
Subsidiaries), and (C) require the preparation or delivery of (i) financial
statements, other than those contemplated by _Section 5.17(d)_ , or (ii) pro
forma financial information or forecasts of the Company and the Subsidiaries
and (y) any documentation executed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall not become effective until the consummation of the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to share all information
subject to such agreement with its financing sources, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by such financing sources with respect thereto.

  


 

  


 

  

 

61  

  


 

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their respective Company Representatives and any Seller
Indemnified Party from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under this _Section 5.17_. Parent
shall, promptly upon request of the Company, reimburse the Company and the
Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company
or the Subsidiaries (including those of their respective Company
Representatives) in connection with the cooperation required by this _Section
5.17_.

  


 

  

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing, and (ii)
that none of Parent's or Merger Sub's respective obligations hereunder are
conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining financing in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(d) If the Closing Date has not occurred on our prior to November 13, 2015,
the Company shall promptly deliver to Parent upon request unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2015, consisting of the consolidated balance sheet at such date
and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the
three- and nine-month periods then ended, in a form consistent with the

5.18 _Regulatory Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, keep Parent
reasonably apprised of all substantive developments with respect to its
interactions with the FDA or any similar Governmental Authority with respect
to the Company's and the Subsidiaries' compliance with applicable Laws, and
its response to the FDA in connection with any and all facility inspections,
Form 483 observations, warning letters, self reporting or similar matters, and
will, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with Parent reasonably in
advance of any substantive response (including proposed operational responses
and timetables with respect thereto) in respect of any such matters and
consider in good faith any input provided by Parent and its advisors with
respect to any such responses (including giving due consideration to the
interests of Parent in light of the pendency of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Company and the Subsidiaries becoming Affiliates of
Parent following the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ that to the extent
Parent is not reasonably expedient in providing such input or it is not
practicable for the Company to request such input before delivering
substantive responses to relevant Governmental Authorities, the Company may
proceed with delivering substantive responses to relevant Governmental
Authorities; _provided_ , _further_ that the ultimate determination of the
manner in which the Company and the Subsidiaries will address the matters
contemplated in this Section 5.18(a) will be made by the Company and the
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.1_ , the Company
shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, provide Parent with all material
correspondence, letters, submissions and other written communications with the
FDA or any similar Governmental Authority (as well as with any third party
regulatory or cGMP auditor) with respect to such matters (including providing
all such materials received by the FDA or any such Governmental Authority
promptly upon receipt); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
5.18_ shall require the Company to provide access or to disclose any
information to Parent if such access or disclosure would cause a risk of a
loss of privilege protection to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (
_provided_ that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
develop an alternative to providing such information reasonably acceptable to
Parent).

  


 

  


 

  

 

62  

  


 

  


 

  

(b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate in good faith to develop a plan and strategy to approach the
FDA or any other Governmental Authority with regard to the Company becoming an
Affiliate of Parent and the involvement of Parent in addressing the matters
described in clause (a) above following the Effective Time.

(c) By the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform ( _A_ ) would give rise, if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, to the failure of a condition

Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1_ shall not be available to
any party whose breach of its (or in the case of the Company, its or the
Representative's) representations or warranties set forth herein or whose
failure to fulfill its obligations or to comply with its covenants under this

is not timely delivered pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ shall be expressly
barred and hereby waived. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth

this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

of a particular date, which need only be true and correct as of such date);

  

  

 

66

of appraisal, dissent or similar rights under any applicable Law (including
the DGCL) in excess of the amount that it would have received in respect of
(x) its Common Stock, if it had received the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration for its Common Stock and (y) its Options, if it had received the
applicable Per Share Option Consideration in respect of its Options and (ii)
any Losses suffered as a result of any claim for breaches of fiduciary duties
owed to the Company or to any stockholder of the Company; and

  


 

  

(d) any Closing Indebtedness or any Seller Transaction Expenses to the extent
not reflected on the Closing Statement.

  


 

  

 _provided_ , that the aggregate amount of Losses with respect to which all
Parent Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 9.2_ shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount (less any
amount disbursed from the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section
2.11(i))_.

  


 

  

9.3 _Seller Indemnification_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ ,
after the Closing Date, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees, stockholders, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns of each such Person (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification for any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by any of them, directly or indirectly, as
a result of, relating to or arising out of:

  


 

  

(a) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Parent or
Merger Sub in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the Effective Time
(except for those representations and warranties that address matters only as
of a particular date, which need only be true and correct as of such date),
and

  


 

  

(b) any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective covenants or
agreements contained herein which are to be performed by Parent or Merger Sub,

9.4 _Claims_.

  


 

  

(a) Any Person seeking indemnification under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give the party from whom
indemnification is being sought (such notified party, the " _Responsible
Party_ ") notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified
Party has determined has given or reasonably expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification hereunder, stating:

  


 

  

(i) that the Indemnified Party believes it has incurred, or will incur,
liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party believes it is or will
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, including a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises (it being agreed that the failure to
specify any provision of this Agreement in such Claim Notice shall not
preclude the Indemnified Party from asserting that there has been a breach of,
or inaccuracy in, or failure to perform such provision); and

  


 

  

(ii) specify in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of the claim including, to
the extent known and reasonably estimable, each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid (if paid), the
basis for any anticipated Liability and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, breach of covenant or agreement or claim to which each
such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder;

  


 

  

 _provided_ , that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

  


 

  

(b) If the Responsible Party has disputed a claim for indemnification under
_Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ (including any Third Party Claim), the Responsible
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution to such dispute. In the event that the Responsible Party shall
object to the indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from the
Responsible Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim (which is
addressed in _Section 9.4_ ( _c_ ) below) as set forth in a Claim Notice, the
Responsible Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days from its receipt of the Claim Notice a notice that the Responsible Party
disputes such claim (such notice, the " _Indemnification Dispute Notice_ ")
and the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty
(60) day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of
such Indemnification Dispute Notice, attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims to which
the Responsible Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the
Responsible Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective
rights with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the
Responsible Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum of agreement
setting forth such agreement. If the Responsible Party and the Indemnified
Party cannot resolve such dispute in sixty (60) days after delivery of the
Indemnification Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the
terms of _Sections 10.6_ , _10.11_ and _10.12._

  


 

  


 

  

 

68  

  


 

  


 

  

(c) If a claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against
any Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ , such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Responsible Party of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible
Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Other than in connection with a Third
Party Claim by a Governmental Authority (including any Taxing Authority), the
Responsible Party shall have fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of such
notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Responsible Party,
of the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Responsible
Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party ( _provided_ that the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party).
So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. In
any case where the Representative is acting on behalf of the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders in connection with a Third Party Claim, all expenses incurred by
the Representative in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim
shall be paid using funds from the Indemnification Escrow Account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ that in such event it shall waive any
right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party or from the
Indemnification Escrow Account, as the case may be, for such claim unless the
Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement. If the
Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of a claim
of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
claim, _provided_ that (i) the Indemnified Party shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the
Responsible Party shall not be deemed to have waived any right to assert that
the Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant to
this Agreement. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of
the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that (w) does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting
such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all
Liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment, (x)
does not involve only the payment of money damages, (y) imposes an injunction
or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or (z) includes any
admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the Indemnified Party. In connection
with a Third Party Claim by a Governmental Authority (including any Taxing
Authority), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the conduct
and control of the settlement or defense thereof, _provided_ that (1) the
Indemnified Party shall permit the Responsible Party to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Responsible Party and (2)
the Responsible Party shall not have any liability for any Losses arising out
of or in connection with such Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim is
settled, adjusted or compromised by the Indemnified Party without the consent
of the Responsible Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  


 

  


 

  

 

69  

  


 

  


 

  

(d) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of
any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal
business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents and
representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information which have been identified by the Responsible Party as
being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in any notifications to insurers.

  


 

  

9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations._ The rights of the
Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article IX_ are subject to the following limitations:

  


 

  

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this _Article IX:_ (i)
the amount of any Loss will be determined on an After-Tax Basis, (ii) all
Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds that have already been
paid at the time the amount of such Losses are determined and (iii) in no
event shall a Responsible Party have liability to the Indemnified Party for
any consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, lost profits,
diminution in value or similar items, except if and to the extent any such
damages are recovered against an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party
Claim.

  


 

  

(b) None of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover for any
particular Loss pursuant to _Sections 9.2_ ( _a_ ), _Section 9.2(b)_ (in
respect of a breach of _Section 5.6_ as it relates to the failure to disclose
any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty) or _9.3_ ( _a_ ) unless such
Loss (or series of related Losses) equals or exceeds $50,000 (each, a "
_Qualifying Loss_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation shall not
apply to Losses in respect of claims for breaches of any Fundamental
Representation; _provided_ , _further_ that in respect of any inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty disclosed after the date of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 5.6_ with respect to which ( _i_ ) the material facts,
events or conditions, as applicable, which caused such inaccuracy first
occurred after the date of this Agreement (or in the case of Litigation, a
notice is first received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
date of this Agreement) and ( _ii_ ) the Company first had Knowledge after the
date of this Agreement, only a Loss (or series of related Losses) with respect
to such supplementally disclosed matters in excess of $500,000 shall be deemed
to be a Qualifying Loss.

  


 

  

(c) None of the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover Qualifying Losses pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)_
or _9.3(a)_ (as applicable) until the total amount of Qualifying Losses which
the Parent Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively,
would recover under _Sections 9.2(a)_ , _Section 9.2(b)_ (in respect of a
breach of _Section 5.6_ as it relates to the failure to disclose any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty _)_ or _9.3(a)_ , but for this
_Section 9.5(c)_ , exceeds $19,312,500 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon the
Parent Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively,
shall be entitled to indemnification only for such Qualifying Losses in excess
of the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible shall not
apply to Losses in respect of claims for breach of any Fundamental
Representation.

  


 

  


 

  

 

70  

  


 

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 9.5_ shall limit any Person's rights to recovery in respect of fraud.

  


 

  

(e) For all purposes of this _Article IX_ , any inaccuracy or breach of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than the
Company's representations and warranties in the fourth sentence of _Section
3.5_ the first sentence of _Section 3.6 (a)_ , _Section 3.7(a)_ , the first
sentence of _Section 3.8_ , and _Sections 3.9(a)_ and _3.14_ ), shall be
determined without reference to the terms "material," "materially," "Material
Adverse Effect," "material adverse effect" or other similar qualifications as
to materiality contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in any such
representation or warranty.

  


 

  

(f) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ , the amount of such Losses will be
determined net of all liabilities that are specifically accrued for the matter
subject to indemnification and reflected in the Final Working Capital.

  


 

  

(g) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Responsible Party is
determined to be covered, in whole or in part, by Third Party Insurance
coverage of the Company as of the date hereof and any DandO "tail" coverage
pursuant to _Section 5.10_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Responsible Party (a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the
Responsible Party so requests within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days
after receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum amount of insurance
proceeds thereunder, in which event all such proceeds actually received, net
of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking such
collection, shall be considered "Eligible Insurance Proceeds". Any amount
payable by a Responsible Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be paid
promptly and payment shall not be delayed pending any determination of
Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers
from a third Person any Eligible Insurance Proceeds and/or any other amount in
respect of any Losses for which a Responsible Party has actually reimbursed
such Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ , such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Responsible Party such Eligible Insurance
Proceeds and/or the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount
of expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of
the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the Responsible Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount
expended by the Responsible Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.

  


 

  

(h) Any Indemnified Party shall take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Losses incurred by such party upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
indemnification rights hereunder.

  


 

  

(i) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from a Responsible Party in
respect of any Losses pursuant to _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a
" _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against
the Responsible Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights
to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Responsible Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such
payment.

  


 

  


 

  

 

71  

  


 

  


 

  

9.6 _Indemnification Payments and Indemnification Escrow_.

  


 

  

(a) Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Notice to which a Responsible
Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt
of such Claim Notice (other than a Third Party Claim, which is addressed in
_Section 9.4(c))_ , claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of agreement of
the nature described in _Section 9.4(b)_ , and claims for Losses the validity
and amount of which have been the subject of judicial determination as
described in _Section 9.4(b_ ) and _Section 10.8_ hereof or shall have been
settled as described in _Section 9.4(c)_ are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_ ". Within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim (or at such other time as the
Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party shall agree), the Responsible
Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party (except in the case where a payment
has been already effected pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement) an
amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a
notice to the Responsible Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
such payment. Amounts to be paid to Parent Indemnified Parties shall be paid
solely from the Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement and the terms hereof.

  


 

  

(b) On the Survival Termination Date, Parent and the Representative shall
provide a joint written instruction, pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement, to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Indemnification
Escrow Account to the Representative and Surviving Corporation by wire
transfer of immediately available funds all or a portion of the cash held in
the Indemnification Escrow Account, such that, following such transfer, the
amount of cash remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account equals only the
amount, if any, of claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ properly
asserted prior to such date by the Parent Indemnified Parties in writing in
accordance with this _Article IX_ , but not yet resolved as of the Survival
Termination Date (such claims, " _Unresolved Claims_ ," and such portion of
cash to be transferred, the " _Indemnification Escrow Remainder_ ") _._ The
Escrow Agent shall release (x) to the Representative, an amount in cash equal
to the Common Stockholders' aggregate Ownership Percentage (in respect of such
Common Stockholders' Common Stock) of the Indemnification Escrow Remainder and
(y) to the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to the remainder
portion of the Indemnification Escrow Remainder. Upon receipt of the foregoing
amounts from the Escrow Agent and subject to _Section 2.10(d)(vi)_ , the
Representative shall promptly pay to each Common Stockholder its applicable
Ownership Percentage (in respect of such Common Stockholder's Common Stock) of
the Indemnification Escrow Remainder, and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly pay to each Optionholder its applicable Ownership Percentage (in
respect of such Optionholder's Options) of the Indemnification Escrow
Remainder. Upon final resolution of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which
an amount had been retained (to the extent not utilized to satisfy valid
claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2_ ), Parent and the
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction, pursuant to the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, to the Escrow Agent to deliver such amount
promptly from the Indemnification Escrow Account by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and such amount shall be paid to each Common
Stockholder and each Optionholder in accordance with the process set forth in
the preceding sentence and the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  


 

  

 

72  

  


 

  


 

  

(c) Promptly upon any Person becoming entitled to release of amounts from the
Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to this _Article IX_ or the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, Parent and the Representative shall provide
joint written instructions, pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement,
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to so release such amounts;
_provided_ that the Representative may issue a unilateral instruction for
release of amounts in respect of expenses incurred by the Representative in
the defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.4_ (
_c_ ) _._

  


 

  

9.7 _Exclusive Remedy._ Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, the parties hereby agree that, in addition to any remedy
available pursuant to _Section 8.4_ , following the Closing, absent fraud, the
sole and exclusive remedy of a party for any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
(or any other claims relating to this Agreement and the other documents,
certificates or agreements delivered pursuant to this Agreement) shall be the
indemnification rights set forth in this _Article IX._

  


 

  

9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments._ The parties hereto agree to treat
any payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law.

10.3 _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and such
counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such counterpart and copies produced
therefrom shall have the same effect as an original. To the extent applicable,
the foregoing constitutes the election of the parties hereto to invoke any Law
authorizing electronic signatures.

10.5 _Interpretation_. The headings preceding the text of Articles and
Sections included in this Agreement and the headings to Sections of the
Disclosure Letter are for convenience only and shall not be deemed part of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter or be given any effect in interpreting
this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter. The use of the masculine, feminine or
neuter gender herein shall not limit any provision of this Agreement. The use
of the terms "including" or "include" shall in all cases herein mean
"including, without limitation" or "include, without limitation,"
respectively. Underscored references to Articles, Sections or Exhibits shall

shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term in this Agreement
the singular. "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to printing,
typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic format) in a
visible form. If any action under this Agreement is required to be done or
taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall be required
to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding Business Day
thereafter. The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like
import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in
any Exhibit or the Disclosure Letter but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning given to such term in this Agreement. References from or

ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  


 

  

10.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be

respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned (including by operation of law) by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation without the prior written consent of the Company and the
Representative; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement (in whole but not in part) to one or more Affiliates of Parent, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations under
this Agreement. Any purported assignment in contravention of this _Section
10.8_ shall be null and void.

  


 

  

10.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the parties hereto and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
confer upon third parties, either express or implied, any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Persons referred to in
_Section 5.10_ are hereby made third party beneficiaries of this Agreement,
with (x) the Fully-Diluted Stockholders having the limited right to pursue
claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for Parent's
or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement to the extent such remedies are
expressly available to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
including _Sections 8.2_ and _8.4_ , and (y) the Persons referred to in
_Section 5.10_ having the rights to indemnification and insurance solely with
respect to _Section 5.10_, _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights granted to
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 10.10_ shall only be
enforceable by the Representative on their behalf in the Representative's sole
and absolute discretion (and not directly by any such Common Stockholder or
Optionholder) and under no circumstances shall any such rights of the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders be enforceable by such Common Stockholders, Optionholders
or by any other Person acting for or on their behalf (other than the
Representative).

  


 

  


 

  

 

76  

  


 

  


 

  

10.10 _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Parent or the
Representative, each party will, on and after the Closing Date, execute and
deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate the Merger and to
effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

10.11 _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits and the Disclosure Letter
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement set forth the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements
and understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

  


 

  

10.12 _JURISDICTION OF DISPUTES_. IN THE EVENT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT

10.14 _Disclosure Letter_. Disclosure in any Section of the Disclosure Letter
shall apply to any Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
relevant to such Section of this Agreement. The inclusion of information in
the Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to any of the Company or the Subsidiaries. In
addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Letter are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the
Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount,
or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and shall not be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of

warranty or covenant), and shall not be construed as an admission of liability
or responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy.

  


 

  

10.15 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any federal,

otherwise.

  


 

  

10.17 _Provision Respecting Representation of Company_. Each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that
Debevoise and Plimpton LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the
Representative, Fully-Diluted Stockholders and their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and
the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Debevoise and Plimpton LLP
may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, notwithstanding such
representation or any continued representation of the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between direct and indirect holders of
Common Stock, the Company and the Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, on the other hand,
in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect holders of Common
Stock and their respective Affiliates (but not the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such communications or to the
files of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP relating to such engagement from and after
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and
after the Effective Time, (a) the direct and indirect holders of Common Stock
and their respective Affiliates (but not the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Debevoise and Plimpton LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the direct and indirect holders of Common Stock and their
respective Affiliates (but not the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries)
shall hold such property rights and (c) Debevoise and Plimpton LLP shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to the Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Debevoise and Plimpton LLP and the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or otherwise. This _Section 10.17_ will be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 10.17_ may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP.

10.18 _Representative_.

  


 

  

(a) The parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative
to act on behalf of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders for certain limited
purposes, as specified herein. The parties have designated Clayton, Dubilier and
Rice, LLC as the initial Representative, and the Stockholder Consent and the
executed Letters of Transmittal will expressly ratify and approve such
designation.

  


 

  

(b) The Company hereby agrees that Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be able
to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Representative
as to the settlement of any claims against the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount pursuant to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, to
the settlement of any claims against the Indemnification Escrow Amount
pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or as to any actions required
or permitted to be taken by the Representative hereunder or under the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) All out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other
advisors' fees and expenses, if applicable) reasonably incurred by the
Representative in performing any actions under this Agreement, the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement will
be paid out of the Representative Escrow Account from time to time, as and
when such fees and expenses are incurred and at the Representative's sole
discretion. In addition, the Representative shall have the right to recover
such fees and expenses from the Indemnification Escrow Account from any amount
that would otherwise be distributed to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and,
prior to such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate
setting forth such fees and expenses actually incurred. The Representative
shall establish such terms and procedures for administering, investing and
disbursing any amounts from the Representative Escrow Amount as it may
determine in its reasonable judgment to be necessary, advisable or desirable
to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement. If any balance of the
Representative Escrow Amount remains undisbursed at such time as all disputes,
claims and other matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement and all other
instruments and agreements to be delivered pursuant hereto have been finally
resolved, then the Representative shall distribute to each Fully-Diluted
Stockholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account (or
by check to an address) designated by each Fully-Diluted Stockholder, such
Fully-Diluted Stockholder's Ownership Percentage of such remainder balance of
the Representative Escrow Account.

  


 

  

(d) Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to perform certain
administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, each of the Company, Merger Sub
and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Representative shall have no
liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any of the Company,
Merger Sub, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with any
obligations of the Representative under this Agreement or otherwise in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent such Losses shall be proven to be the direct result of fraud by the
Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations
hereunder.

  


 

  


 

  

 

80  

  


 

  


 

  

(e) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(f) The Representative hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
that:

  


 

  

(i) The Representative has been duly formed and is validly existing as a
limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Representative has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

(ii) The execution and delivery by the Representative of this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Agreement and the performance by the Representative of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder do not and will not conflict with or violate any
provision of any applicable law, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Authority applicable to, or the organizational documents of, the
Representative.

  


 

  

(iii) Except (A) for filings under _Section 2.3_ , (B) for filings under the
HSR Act, and (C) as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Letter, no
notice to, filing with, or authorization, registration, consent or approval of
any Governmental Authority is necessary for the Representative's execution of
this Agreement or the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement or its consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  


 

  

10.19 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Parent Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and
its heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns and all of the other
Related Parties, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the
Representative, and each of their respective past, present or future officers,
managers, directors, trustees, shareholders, partners, members, beneficiaries,
Affiliates, employees, counsel and agents, in each case, in their respective
capacities as such, or in connection with the direct or indirect investment in
the Company (each, a " _Seller Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all
actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues
and suits of every kind, nature and description whatsoever (collectively, "
_Claims_ ") which such Parent Releasor or its heirs, legal representatives,
successors or assigns ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any
matter, cause or thing whatsoever prior to the Effective Time resulting or
arising from or relating to the Seller Releasee's status as such, or in
connection with the direct or indirect investment in the Company. Each Parent
Releasor agrees not to, and agrees to cause its respective Affiliates and
subsidiaries and all of the other Related Parties not to, assert any such
Claim against the Seller Releasees after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Parent Releasor and its respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns and all of the other Related Parties
retain, and do not release, their rights and interests (x) under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) with respect to any
Claim or Liability solely to the extent resulting from a Seller Releasee's
fraud or criminal act or (z) with respect to any Claim or Liability to the
extent resulting from a Seller Releasee's status as an Employee.
