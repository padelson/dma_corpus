(vii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, HoldCo shall prepare
and file with the SEC a Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form)
registering a number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock necessary to fulfill
HoldCos obligations under this _Section 3.1(g)_. HoldCo shall take all

(h) _No Dissenters  Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Diamond Common Stock or
Orion Common Stock in connection with the Mergers.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Orion and Diamond shall
mutually designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder
services provider (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging, in
accordance with this _Article III_, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
the Merger Consideration. In addition, at or prior to the Effective Time,
HoldCo shall, and Diamond and Orion shall cause HoldCo to, deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Diamond Common Stock and the holders of shares of Orion Common Stock
evidence of shares of HoldCo Common Stock representing the aggregate amount of
shares of HoldCo Common Stock sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration
(such shares, together any dividends or

 



      
 

 



 

distributions with respect thereto, hereinafter, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (an " _Orion Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (an " _Orion
Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Orion Common Stock, as applicable, and to each holder of
record of a certificate (a " _Diamond Certificate_ " and, together with an
Orion Certificate, a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Diamond
Book-Entry Share_ " and, together with an Orion Book-Entry Share, a " _Book-
Entry Share_ ,") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Diamond Common Stock, as applicable, whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as HoldCo may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by HoldCo, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole
shares of HoldCo Common Stock and/or cash, as applicable, that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, and
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If any portion of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration of such Merger Consideration that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of such registration in the name of a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for
the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to HoldCo Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to any shares of HoldCo Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_, in each case until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article III_.
Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of shares
of HoldCo Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,

 



      
 

 



 

without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of HoldCo Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such shares of HoldCo Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares
of HoldCo Common Stock.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Orion Common Stock, Diamond Common Stock
and Diamond Series A Preferred Stock_. All shares of HoldCo Common Stock
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Orion Common Stock, Diamond Common Stock or Diamond Series A Preferred
Stock, as applicable, theretofore represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of HoldCo to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Orion or Diamond, as
applicable, on such shares of Orion Common Stock, Diamond Common Stock or
Diamond Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Orion
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Orion Common Stock, or the Diamond
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Diamond Common Stock or Diamond Series
A Preferred Stock, that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to HoldCo or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_, except as otherwise
provided by law.

 



 

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) No certificates representing fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of HoldCo.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Orion Common Stock converted pursuant to either Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of HoldCo Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of HoldCo Common Stock
delivered to the Exchange Agent by HoldCo for issuance to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the aggregate number of full
shares of HoldCo Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as the " _Excess
Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-

 



      
 

 



 

Entry Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
NYSE, all in the manner provided herein.

 



 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions, transfer taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts
to such holders subject to and in accordance with this _Section 3.2(e)_.

 



 

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to HoldCo, upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter be entitled to
look only to HoldCo for payment of their claim for any shares of HoldCo Common
Stock, any Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HoldCo
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to HoldCo Common
Stock.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Orion, Diamond, HoldCo, Orion Merger Sub, the
Orion Surviving Corporation, Diamond Merger Sub, the Diamond Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven years
after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any cash, any shares of HoldCo Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of HoldCo Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect
to HoldCo Common Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of HoldCo, free and clear of all claims or interests
of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by HoldCo, provided, that no
losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of
shares of Orion Common Stock or shares of Diamond Common Stock pursuant to
this _Article III_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to HoldCo.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of HoldCo and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by HoldCo or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as HoldCo or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Orion Common Stock or shares of Diamond Common Stock, as applicable,
formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HoldCo
Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of HoldCo
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Orion Common Stock or Diamond
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
dividend payable in stock or other securities or other similar transaction,
the Orion Exchange Ratio and related provisions shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Orion Common Stock and Diamond Common
Stock or Orion Equity Awards and Diamond Equity Awards the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange, dividend or other similar
transaction.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors or managers, as applicable, of HoldCo, Diamond
Surviving Corporation and Orion Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Orion or Diamond, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf thereof, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in HoldCo, any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by HoldCo as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

Agreement (as amended to the date of this Agreement, the " _Orion Filed SEC
Documents_ ") and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") since January 1, 2014 (excluding any disclosures in any risk factors
section, in any section related to forward-looking statements and other
disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed
in the disclosure letter delivered by Orion to Diamond prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Orion Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the
particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken
(provided, that such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular
subsection and such other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it

to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries,
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Orion. Each of Orion and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Orion. Orion
has delivered to or made available to Diamond prior to the date of this
Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Orion (the " _Orion Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and the
By-laws of Orion not filed as of the date of this Agreement with the Orion
Filed SEC Documents.

delivered by Orion and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Diamond, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Orion, enforceable against Orion in accordance with its terms,
except that (A) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,

specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought (collectively, the " _Enforceability
Exceptions_ ").

 



 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
pledge, claim, lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or

conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (1) have
a Material Adverse Effect on Orion or (2) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local,

registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2013 (the "

Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_

Documents when filed and at their respective effective times, if applicable,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or

on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Orion and its consolidated subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30,
2015 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Orion nor any of its subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of Orion and its subsidiaries (or in the notes

to have a Material Adverse Effect on Orion.

 



 

(iv) Orion maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as

registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2013 (the "

Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may

to the Diamond SEC Documents, and none of the Diamond SEC Documents when filed

its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to

(or in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Diamond.

and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Diamond are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Diamond in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Diamond, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Diamond to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(vi) Neither Diamond nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Diamond and any
of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Diamond or any of
its subsidiaries in Diamonds or such subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Diamond SEC Documents.

make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to Diamonds stockholders or at the time of the
Diamond Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
Diamond with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied

necessary for Diamond and/or Orion to enter into financing transactions
(including, without limitation, the raising of new financing, the refinancing
of existing indebtedness, the retirement of existing indebtedness and/or
producing amendments, modifications or consents in relating to existing
indebtedness) (any such financing transaction, a " _Pre-Merger Financing
Transaction_ "). In connection with any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, the

its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information, (B)
in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure of
any such information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege; provided, further, that with respect to clauses (A) through (C) of
this _Section 5.1(d)_, Orion or Diamond, as applicable, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any
third party necessary to provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative
to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Orion or Diamond and (3) in the case of clauses (A) through (C),

disclosure of such information without violating Applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege.

 



 

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation by Orion_. (a) Orion shall not, shall not
authorize or permit any of its controlled affiliates or any of its or their
officers, directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative (a " _Representative_ ") retained by it or any of its
controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through another person,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation

 



       
 

 



 

of which would constitute an Orion Alternative Transaction, or (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with
any person (or group of persons), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or
the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute an
Orion Alternative Transaction, except to notify such person (or group of
persons) as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.2_;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to obtaining the Orion
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Orion determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result from a
material breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in an Orion Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with
_Section 5.2(c)_, Orion and its Representatives may (A) furnish information
with respect to Orion and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources) (provided
that all such information has previously been provided to Diamond or is
provided to Diamond prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms as to confidentiality (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not include any "standstill" terms) generally
no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated
November 24, 2015, as amended, entered into between Orion and Diamond (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources). For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Orion Alternative Transaction_ " means any of
(i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or
group of persons) other than Diamond and its subsidiaries (including HoldCo,
Orion Merger Sub and Diamond Merger Sub) (such person (or group of persons),
an " _Orion Third Party_ "), acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act) of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Orion Common Stock or
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of Orion, whether from Orion or pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any Orion Third Party
acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of
Orion or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Orion and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any
Orion Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control
of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of
subsidiaries of Orion and any entity surviving any merger or combination
including any of them) of Orion or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or
more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated
basis) of Orion and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (iv) any disposition
of assets to an Orion Third Party representing 20% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Orion and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.2(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Orion nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make,
in each case in a manner adverse to Diamond, the approval or recommendation by
such Board of Directors or such committee of the Orion Merger or this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend,

 



      
 

 



 

any Orion Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or this clause
(ii) being referred to as an " _Orion Recommendation Change_ "), _provided_ ,
that nothing herein shall restrict or otherwise limit Orion from making
accurate disclosure to its stockholders of factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Orion or, so long as
Orion provides Diamond with reasonable advance notice and a copy of the
proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the consummation of which would
constitute an Orion Alternative Transaction has been made, the identity of the
party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be an Orion Recommendation Change), so long
as the disclosure through which such factual information is conveyed, taken as
a whole, is not contrary to or materially inconsistent with the recommendation
made by the Orion Board of Directors; or (iii) cause Orion or any of its
controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Orion
Alternative Transaction or requiring, or reasonably likely to cause, Orion to
terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede,
interfere with or be inconsistent with, the consummation of the Mergers or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.2(a)_). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining the Orion Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of Orion determines in good faith, after it
has received an Orion Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Orion may
(subject to this and the following sentences) effect an Orion Recommendation
Change, but only at a time that is after the fourth business day following
Diamonds receipt of written notice from Orion advising Diamond that the Board
of Directors of Orion has received an Orion Superior Proposal specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Orion Superior Proposal, identifying the
person making such Orion Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make
an Orion Recommendation Change; provided that in the event of a subsequent
modification to the material terms and conditions of such Orion Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Orion may only effect an Orion
Recommendation Change after the second business day following Diamonds
receipt of written notice from Orion advising Diamond of the modification to
such terms and conditions; and provided further that during such four or two
business day notice period, as applicable, Orion engages (to the extent
requested by Diamond) in good faith negotiations with Diamond to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter into an Orion
Alternative Transaction no longer constitutes an Orion Superior Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, an " _Orion Superior Proposal_ " means any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by an Orion Third Party to enter into an Orion
Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of Orion
Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes)
that (A) did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.2(a)_, (B) is on
terms that the Board of Directors of Orion determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of view to
Orions stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Diamond in response to such proposal to
enter into an Orion Alternative Transaction and the identity of the person
making such proposal to enter into an Orion Alternative Transaction), and (C)
is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal. In addition,
notwithstanding

 



      
 

 



 

anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt
of the Orion Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of Orion
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Orion may effect an Orion
Recommendation Change in response to any Orion Intervening Event, but only at
a time that is after the fourth business day following Diamonds receipt of
written notice from Orion advising Diamond of all material information with
respect to any such Orion Intervening Event and stating that it intends to
make an Orion Recommendation Change and providing its rationale therefor. The
term " _Orion Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material event or change in
circumstance that arises or occurs after the date of this Agreement that,
prior to the date of this Agreement, was neither known nor reasonably
foreseeable by the Board of Directors of Orion; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an Orion Alternative
Transaction or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute
an Orion Intervening Event and (ii) in no event shall any event or events that
has or have an adverse effect on the business, properties, financial condition
or results of operations of Diamond and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
constitute an Orion Intervening Event unless such event or events has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Diamond Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Orion set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_
and _5.2(b)_ , Orion shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt thereof, advise Diamond orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any proposal relating to an Orion Alternative Transaction,
the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or
proposal. Orion shall (i) keep Diamond reasonably informed of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to Diamond as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written materials exchanged between Orion or its subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request or
proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any material
respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or
proposal.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit Orion from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; provided, however, that any such disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains an Orion Recommendation Change shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_.

 



 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by Diamond_. (a) Diamond shall not, shall not
authorize or permit any of its controlled affiliates or any of its or their
officers, directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause any Representatives retained by it or any of its controlled
affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information),
or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries
regarding, or the making of, any proposal

 



      
 

 



 

the consummation of which would constitute a Diamond Alternative Transaction
or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any
way with any person (or group of persons), with respect to any inquiries
regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a Diamond Alternative Transaction, except to notify such person (or
group of persons) as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section
5.2_; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to obtaining the Diamond
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Diamond determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result
from a material breach of this _Section 5.3(a)_ constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Diamond Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with _Section 5.3(c)_, Diamond and its Representatives may (A)
furnish information with respect to Diamond and its subsidiaries to the person
(or group of persons) making such proposal (and its Representatives and
financing sources) (provided that all such information has previously been
provided to Orion or is provided to Orion prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not include any
"standstill" terms) generally no less restrictive than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons) making such
proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Diamond Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a
transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group
of persons) other than Orion and its subsidiaries (including HoldCo, Orion
Merger Sub and Diamond Merger Sub) (such persons (or group of persons), a "
_Diamond Third Party_ "), acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more
than 20% of the outstanding shares of Diamond Common Stock or securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting
power of Diamond, whether from Diamond or pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or
similar transaction pursuant to which any Diamond Third Party acquires or
would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of Diamond or any
of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or
assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Diamond and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Diamond Third
Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries
of Diamond and any entity surviving any merger or combination including any of
them) of Diamond or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of
Diamond and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iv) any disposition of
assets to a Diamond Third Party representing 20% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Diamond and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Diamond nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make,
in each case in a manner adverse to Orion, the approval or recommendation by
such Board of Directors or such committee of the Diamond Merger or this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Diamond Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or
this clause (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

being referred to as a " _Diamond Recommendation Change_ "), _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall restrict or otherwise limit Diamond from making accurate
disclosure to its stockholders of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Diamond or, so long as Diamond
provides Orion with reasonable advance notice and a copy of the proposed
disclosure, the fact that a proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a Diamond Alternative Transaction has been made, the identity of
the party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and
such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Diamond Recommendation Change), so
long as the disclosure through which such factual information is conveyed,
taken as a whole, is not contrary to or materially inconsistent with the
recommendation made by the Diamond Board of Directors or (iii) cause Diamond
or any of its controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to
any Diamond Alternative Transaction or requiring, or reasonably likely to
cause, Diamond to terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the consummation of
the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining the
Diamond Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Diamond determines in
good faith, after it has received a Diamond Superior Proposal (and after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of Diamond may (subject to this and the following sentences) effect
a Diamond Recommendation Change, but only at a time that is after the fourth
business day following Orions receipt of written notice from Diamond advising
Orion that the Board of Directors of Diamond has received a Diamond Superior
Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of such Diamond Superior
Proposal, identifying the person making such Diamond Superior Proposal and
stating that it intends to make a Diamond Recommendation Change; provided that
in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and conditions
of such Diamond Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Diamond may only
effect a Diamond Recommendation Change after the second business day following
Orions receipt of written notice from Diamond advising Orion of the
modification to such terms and conditions; and provided further that during
such four or two business day notice period, as applicable, Diamond engages
(to the extent requested by Orion) in good faith negotiations with Orion to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter into a
Diamond Alternative Transaction no longer constitutes a Diamond Superior
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Diamond Superior Proposal_ "
means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified) made by a Diamond Third Party to enter into a
Diamond Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition
of Diamond Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for
these purposes) that (A) did not result from a material breach of _Section
5.3(a)_, (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Diamond determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of
view to Diamonds stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to
this Agreement that may be proposed by Orion in response to such proposal to
enter into a Diamond Alternative Transaction and the identity of the person
making such proposal to enter into a Diamond Alternative Transaction) and (C)
is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal

 



      
 

 



 

and other aspects of such proposal. In addition, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Diamond Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of Diamond determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Diamond may effect a Diamond
Recommendation Change in response to any Diamond Intervening Event, but only
at a time that is after the fourth business day following Orions receipt of
written notice from Diamond advising Orion of all material information with
respect to any such Diamond Intervening Event and stating that it intends to
make a Diamond Recommendation Change and providing its rationale therefor. The
term " _Diamond Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material event or change in
circumstance that arises or occurs after the date of this Agreement that,
prior to the date of this Agreement, was neither known nor reasonably
foreseeable by the Board of Directors of Diamond; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an Diamond
Alternative Transaction or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof
constitute an Diamond Intervening Event and (ii) in no event shall any event
or events that has or have an adverse effect on the business, properties,
financial condition or results of operations of Orion and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, constitute a Diamond Intervening Event unless such event or
events has had or would reasonably be expected to have an Orion Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Diamond set forth in _Sections 5.3(a)_
and _5.3(b)_ , Diamond shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt thereof, advise Orion orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any proposal relating to a Diamond Alternative Transaction,
the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or
proposal. Diamond shall (i) keep Orion reasonably informed of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to Orion as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written materials exchanged between Diamond or its subsidiaries or any
of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request
or proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any material
respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or
proposal.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit Diamond from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its
position thereunder; provided, however, that any such disclosure or statement
that constitutes or contains a Diamond Recommendation Change shall be subject
to the provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Orion and Diamond shall prepare, and the parties shall cause HoldCo
to file with the SEC, the Joint Proxy Statement, and Diamond and Orion shall
prepare and cause HoldCo to file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint
Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus. Each of Orion, Diamond and
HoldCo shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing. Orion, Diamond and HoldCo shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments and
advise the other party of any oral comments, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement received from the SEC. HoldCo, Diamond and Orion shall cooperate and
provide the other parties with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the
SEC, and with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding
any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement
(including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of both Orion and Diamond, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided
that with respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this right of approval
shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or
its business, financial condition or results of operations, or the combined
entity; and provided, further, that this approval right shall not apply with
respect to information relating to an Orion Recommendation Change or a Diamond
Recommendation Change. Orion shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Orions stockholders, and Diamond shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Diamonds stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each party shall advise
the other parties, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Orion, Diamond,
HoldCo, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by Orion, Diamond or HoldCo that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Orion and
Diamond.

 



 

(b) Orion shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Orion Stockholders Meeting_ ") in
accordance with the DGCL for the purpose

 



      
 

 



 

of obtaining the Orion Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_, through its Board of Directors, recommend to
its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement. Orion may only postpone or
adjourn the Orion Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining the Orion Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence
of a quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Orion has
determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely
to be required under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of Orion prior to
the Orion Stockholders Meeting; provided, however, that Orion shall postpone
or adjourn the Orion Stockholders Meeting up to two (2) times for up to thirty
days each time upon the reasonable request of Diamond.

 



 

(c) Diamond shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Diamond Stockholders Meeting_ ") in
accordance with the DGCL for the purpose of obtaining the Diamond Stockholder
Approval and shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_, through
its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this
Agreement. Diamond may only postpone or adjourn the Diamond Stockholders
Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
Diamond Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, and (iii) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that Diamond has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of Diamond prior to the Diamond
Stockholders Meeting; provided, however, that Diamond shall postpone or
adjourn the Diamond Stockholders Meeting up to two (2) times for up to thirty
days each time upon the reasonable request of Orion.

 



 

(d) Orion and Diamond shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the Orion
Stockholders Meeting and the Diamond Stockholders Meeting on the same date and
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The only matters to be voted upon at each of the Orion Stockholders
Meeting and the Diamond Stockholders Meeting are (i) the Mergers, as
applicable, (ii) any adjournment or postponement of the Orion Stockholders
Meeting or the Diamond Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, and (iii) any
other matters as are required by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Applicable Law, and in furtherance of
_Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(c)_ hereof, upon reasonable notice, each of Orion
and Diamond shall, and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries to,
afford to the other party and to the officers, employees and Representatives
of such other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
(provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of such party), and during such period, each of Orion and
Diamond shall, and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to the other party all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as

 



      
 

 



 

such other party may reasonably request; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not require Orion or Diamond to disclose any information pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith
judgment of such party, any Applicable Law requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information, (ii) in
the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, the information is subject
to confidentiality obligations to a third party or (iii) disclosure of any
such information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege; provided, further, that with respect to clauses (i) through (iii)
of this _Section 6.2_, Orion or Diamond, as applicable, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any
third party necessary to provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative
to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Orion or Diamond and (3) in the case of clauses (i) through
(iii), utilize the procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such
other techniques if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably
permit the disclosure of such information without violating Applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege. No review pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall
affect any representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Each of
Orion and Diamond shall hold, and shall cause its respective affiliates,
officers, employees and Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, as soon as possible following the date hereof, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts in (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities, including any
required action or non-action under the Antitrust Laws (the " _Required
Consents_ ") prior to the Effective Time, and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain a Required Consent from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers, and any necessary or appropriate financing arrangements, from
third parties, (iii) the contesting and defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement, and (v) refraining from taking any action that
would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Mergers. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) appropriate
filings, if any are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly
as practicable and (iii) all other necessary filings with other Governmental
Entities relating to the Merger, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
formally or informally requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or by such
authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the

 



      
 

 



 

expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the
Antitrust Laws and the receipt of the Required Consents as soon as
practicable. The parties agree that the use of "reasonable best efforts" in
this _Section 6.3_ shall include proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (x) the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of either party or its
Subsidiaries or affiliates and (y) restrictions, or actions that after the
Effective Time would limit HoldCos or its subsidiaries or affiliates
freedom of action or operations with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its or its subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets, in
each case (A) as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (B) conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers.

 



 

(b) The parties shall jointly develop, and each of the parties shall consult
and cooperate in all respects with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with the form and content of any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission. Each of the parties shall (i) promptly notify the other party of
any communication inquiry or investigation received by that party from, or
given by it to, any Governmental Entity and, subject to Applicable Law, permit
the other party to review in advance any proposed communication to any such
Governmental Entity and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments,
(ii) not agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any such
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Mergers unless, to the extent reasonably
practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate therein and (iii) promptly furnish the other party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between
them and their affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees
and Representatives, on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger in order for such other party to meaningfully consult and participate
in accordance with the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), provided that materials
furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_ may be redacted as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, HoldCo shall indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of Diamond or Orion or any of their subsidiaries
or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior
to the Effective Time, serving at the request of Diamond or Orion, as
applicable, or any of their respective subsidiaries as a director or officer
of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated

 



       
 

 



 

hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer or director of Diamond or Orion, as applicable, or any of
their respective subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Diamond
or Orion, as applicable, or any of their respective subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another person or in respect of any acts or omissions in their
capacities as such directors of officers occurring prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by Diamond pursuant to the Diamond Certificate of
Incorporation, the By-laws of Diamond or the governing or organizational
documents of any subsidiary of Diamond, or by Orion pursuant to the Orion
Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of Orion or the governing
organizational documents of any subsidiary of Orion, as applicable, or and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (i) each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from HoldCo to the same extent as
such Indemnified Parties are entitled to advance of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by Diamond pursuant to the Diamond Certificate of
Incorporation, the By-laws of Diamond or the governing or organizational
documents of any subsidiary of Diamond, or by Orion pursuant to the Orion
Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of Orion or the governing or
organizational documents of any subsidiary of Orion, as applicable, and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement;
provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, the Diamond
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of Diamond, or the Orion
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of Orion, as applicable, and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification and (ii) HoldCo shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event
that HoldCo, Orion Surviving Corporation or Diamond Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges

party of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against such party or
any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any stockholders of such
party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such party) relating to this

remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further

remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this _Section 9.12_ with respect thereto. Upon a determination that any term
