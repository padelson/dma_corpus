Article III 
 Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates

  



  

Section 3.1. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or its stockholders, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(i) any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_ , (ii) any share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub,
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or any
Company Subsidiary, (iii) any shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting
Shares_ "), which are held by stockholders who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for (or lost their right to) appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), (iv) any shares of
Company Restricted Stock, the treatment of which is described in _Section 3.5_
 and (v) any shares of Company Common Stock as to which treatment in the
Merger is separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, which shares shall be treated in the
manner so agreed) shall be converted, subject to _Section 3.1(d)_ , into the
right to receive $13.10 in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common
Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) _Change in Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or
any other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or
exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and to provide to the
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
_Section 3.1(d)_ shall not be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

  



    

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
payment pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , subject to exchange through the Paying
Agent in accordance with this _Article III_ , cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration
payable in connection with the Merger in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively;  _provided_ , that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Company Common Stock. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
", it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall
be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ : (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to Certificates held in book-entry form) and
with such other provisions as Parent may determine (which shall specify that
delivery of any Certificate shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
such Certificate shall pass, only upon the proper delivery of such
Certificate to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions (or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other
uncertificated form, upon the confirmation of a book-entry transfer of the
surrender of such shares), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ ,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article III_ , without any interest
thereon.

  



    

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Payments to other Persons_. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer or properly transferred and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable.

  



  

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (and any interest or other income earned thereon) which remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws),
without any interest thereon.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by stockholders of the Company as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent (or at Parent's
election, one or more of its designees) free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit and indemnity of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as security for the indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_
without any interest thereon.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



    

 

  



  

(h) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or unsurrendered uncertificated shares.

  



  

(i) _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold
or cause to be deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable

would be reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure and (3) nothing

of, or modification to, the representations and warranties set forth in

applicable to such other section), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 4.1. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a "
_Company Subsidiary_ ") has been duly organized, and is validly existing and,
where such concept is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be,
except to the extent the failure of any such Company Subsidiary to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the
failure to have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date, and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are not in violation of such organizational documents.

the expiration date (if any) of such Company Stock-Based Award, and the
vesting schedule of such Company Stock-Based Award. All of the outstanding

state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company has
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all material
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of
the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since December 5, 2014
and prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the
SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings. To the Knowledge of
the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, none of the Company SEC
Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or
outstanding SEC investigation.

  



  

(b) _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any notes and schedules thereto)
contained in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Filings, and
including all Company SEC Filings filed after the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Company Financial Statements_ "), was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements filed on Form
10-Q, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis
during the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto), and each presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company as of the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Company for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal adjustments which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole). The books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have been maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and all other applicable Laws and reflect only actual
transactions. Deloitte and Touche, LLP has not resigned or been dismissed (and
the Company's former auditor, Ernst and Young LLP, did not resign and was not
dismissed) as independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or
in connection with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure. There are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the
Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required to be

(c) _Internal Controls_.

  



  

(i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have established and
maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such internal controls
are effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of Company Financial
Statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies
and procedures that (I) require the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (II)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of the
Company's management and the Company Board and (III) provide assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Since
December 5, 2014, the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (A) all known significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
the Company's financial statements or internal controls and the Company has
made available to Parent copies of any material written materials relating to
each of the foregoing. The Company has made available to Parent all such
disclosures made by management to the Company's auditors and audit committee
since December 5, 2014.

  



  

(ii) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls
and procedures" and "internal control over financial reporting" (as such
terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). The
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all
(I) material information relating to the Company required to be included in
reports and other documents filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and (II) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, particularly during
the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Company's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such
system was effective. Since December 5, 2014, the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor
its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received
notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications.

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or Company Subsidiaries or their accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's system of internal accounting controls.

  



  

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any
prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made

except for liabilities or obligations (i) that were incurred after January 2,
2016 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii)
that were set forth in the Company's consolidated balance sheet (or in the
notes thereto) for the year ended January 2, 2016 included in the Company
Financial Statements in the Company SEC Filings prior to the date of this
Agreement, (iii) under Contracts in effect as of the date hereof, true
complete and correct copies of which have been provided to Parent prior to

Section 6.2. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting_.

  



  

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement relating
to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable (and
in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days) after the date of this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub each shall furnish all information
concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the Company may reasonably
request in connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to and without limiting the rights of the Company Board
pursuant to _Section 6.4_ , the Proxy Statement shall include (i) the Company
Recommendation, (ii) all material disclosure relating to the
Company Financial Advisor (including the amount of fees and other
consideration the Company Financial Advisor will receive upon consummation of
the Merger, and the conditions for the payment of such fees and other
consideration), the opinion referred to in _Section 4.3(b)_ and the basis for
rendering such opinion and (iii) a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement complies in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and satisfies all rules of NASDAQ. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof.

  



  

(b) _SEC Comments_. The Company, after consultation with Parent,
will use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and
will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC
or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement or filing any other filings or materials relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting (including any "soliciting material" as such term
is used in Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act), or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or responding to any comments of or
otherwise communicating with the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document, response or other communication, shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent or its counsel and shall include in such document, response
or other communication comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its counsel.
As promptly as practicable, the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement and
all other proxy materials to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and, if necessary in order to comply with applicable securities Laws, after
the Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended or
supplemented proxy material.

  



    

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Information Supplied_. Each of Parent and the Company agrees,
as to it and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or
other Representatives, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or the Company, as applicable, expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any other documents filed
or to be filed with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, will, as of the time such documents (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) are filed with the SEC and mailed to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agrees
that all documents that such Party is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand,
makes any covenant with respect to any information provided by the other for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any document that such first Party
is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any event or
circumstance relating to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors which should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement (so that
such document would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading) should be
discovered by Parent or the Company, such Party shall promptly inform the
other Party and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose such event
or circumstance and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

(d) _Stockholders ' Meeting_.

  



  

(i) The Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be
held as promptly as practicable following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date;
_provided_ , that without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall not be held later than forty-five (45) days after
the date of the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. The Company may not adjourn,
postpone or call a recess of the Company Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ , that if, on a date for which the
Company Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to obtain the Stockholder
Approval or to obtain a quorum for such meeting, the Company shall, at
Parent's request, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders' Meeting
solely for the purpose of and for the minimum time reasonably necessary to
obtain the Stockholder Approval.

  



  

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the
Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the NASDAQ Stock
Market Rules to establish a record date for purposes of determining
stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (the " _Record Date_ ") and to commence a "broker search" pursuant to
Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The Company shall consult with Parent in good faith regarding the
foregoing. Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company
shall not change such Record Date or establish a different record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(iii) The Company's obligation to establish a record date for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting pursuant
to this _Section 6.2(d)_ shall not be limited, or otherwise affected, by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or by the making of a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, and notwithstanding
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation, unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to, and
in accordance with _Article VIII_ , this Agreement shall be submitted to the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval.
Unless there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Intervening Event Change of Recommendation specifically permitted by _Section
6.4(d)_ , the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the
Stockholder Approval. Upon the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the
Company or its Representatives with respect to the Stockholder Approval.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act in connection therewith, shall be the only matters (other than
procedural matters related thereto) which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

Effective Time, the Company shall not be required to provide access to or
furnish any information if doing so would violate applicable Law, or where
such access to information would involve the waiver of an attorney-client
privilege so long as the Company has taken all reasonable steps to permit
inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not
violate applicable Law or compromise the Company's or any
Company Subsidiary's privilege with respect thereto, including by disclosing
such information to external counsel to Parent to the extent required to
comply with applicable Law or maintain such privilege, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger
Sub, without having to be requested to do so, the monthly management
financial reporting package for each month up to and including the month of
the Effective Time as soon as the same is available and consistent with past
practice. All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall be
subject to the NDA.

of the foregoing, except at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder

consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal;

pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ ;

  



    

 | 54|

Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 6.4(d)(i)_ , which notice shall specify the basis for such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity
of the Person making the Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof, and shall include copies of all relevant documents
(including a copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement) relating
to such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any material revision,
amendment, update or supplement to the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including any change to the financial terms) shall be deemed to

termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and
legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the
Parent Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal;

  



  

(F) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
continues to determine in good faith, after consultation with an independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would
continue to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law (in each case taking into
account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in writing by
Parent); and

  



    

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(G) in the case that the Company Board authorizes the Company to
terminate this Agreement to substantially concurrently enter into a
binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , including the payment of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ ; or

  



  

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Board may take any action prohibited by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of
Section 6.4(c) (an " _Intervening Event Change of Recommendation_ ") in
response to an Intervening Event if and only if, prior to taking any such
action:

  



  

(A) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, taking into account all

pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ ;

  



  

(B) the Company shall have complied in all respects with its
obligations under this _Section 6.4_ ;

developments with respect to such Intervening Event;

  



  

(D) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice to Parent
for at least the Notice Period to the effect that the Company Board has
determined to effect an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation and that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may
be offered by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ , which notice shall
specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

  



  

(E) prior to effecting such Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation, the Company and its Representatives shall, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent Representatives in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that such Intervening
Event no longer necessitates such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation;
and

  



  

(F) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
continues to determine in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that such Intervening Event continues to constitute an Intervening
Event, such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation and failure to effect an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would continue to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law (in each case taking into account any
revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent).

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication to stockholders);
_provided_ , that if such disclosure includes a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (it being understood that a "stop, look and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act shall not in and of itself be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change), it being understood that any such statement or
disclosure made by the Company Board pursuant to this _Section 6.4(e)_ must
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board and the
rights of Parent under this Section 6.4, it being understood that nothing in
the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change other than in accordance with
_Section 6.4(d)_.

  



  

(f) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) notify Parent in writing if any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, constituting or that are
reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any
non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations
are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative indicating, in connection with such
notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such inquiry,
indication, request for information or discussion, offer or proposal and the
material terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any requests,
inquiries, proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, inquiries, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis, of the status, terms and details (including, within twenty-four (24)
hours after the occurrence of any amendment, modification, development,
discussion or negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry,
proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this _Section
6.4_ and (ii) provide to Parent promptly and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements
(and any other written material to the extent such material contains any
financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any
Acquisition Proposal) sent by or provided to the Company or any Company

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without limiting
the Company's cooperation obligations under this _Section 6.6(d)_ , with
respect to any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement or

giving effect to any Replacement Financing contemplated thereunder (to the
extent more onerous, the " _Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation_ ") and

Party's Knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including its officers or directors) or otherwise relating to,

wage level at an annual rate that is substantially similar to the annual rate
of the base salary or wage level that was provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits that each such
Continuing Employee was entitled to receive immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing (the "

Subsidiary, as applicable, or any predecessor entity thereto, by any
Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date will be credited for
eligibility, participation and vesting purposes (other than for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under such plan,
program or policy and for purposes of calculating benefits under any
severance, sick leave or vacation plans, except where such crediting would
result in duplication of benefits. The Purchaser Plans shall not deny
Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions to the
extent such conditions were waived or satisfied under similar Company Plans
immediately prior to the Closing and shall credit such Continuing Employees
for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date

plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses relate.

  



  

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 6.10_ with respect to employees of the Company and
the Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the Parties and shall

other Person, including, without limitation, any employee, former employee or
any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Plan or Purchaser
Plan, or (ii) to employment or continued employment with the Company, any of
the Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained in
this _Section 6.10_ , express or implied, is intended to be or shall be
considered to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program, agreement,
arrangement or policy of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation nor shall it interfere with Parent's, the
Surviving Corporation's or any of the Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Plan (subject to the terms of such Company Plan) or to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or the Subsidiaries
for any reason; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation and the

agreements between any Indemnified Party and the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that have been delivered and made available to Parent prior to the

previously made available to Parent, shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time (such period, the " _Tail Period_ "), the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less

(b) During the Tail Period, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering each officer and director currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to any matter
claimed against such person by reason of him or her serving in such capacity
on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable in any
material respect in the aggregate than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement (such current annual premium, as set forth in _Section
6.12(b) _ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the " _Current Premium Amount_
"); _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of such insurance
policy exceed for any one policy year during the Tail Period 300% of the
Current Premium Amount, it being understood that the Surviving Corporation
shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to
each year during the Tail Period, as may be obtained for such amount. In lieu
of the foregoing insurance coverage, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
may (following reasonable consultation with Parent), or the Company shall if
requested by Parent, obtain a prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy, the material terms of which, including coverage
and amount, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the insurance coverage
otherwise required under this _Section 6.12(b)_ ; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the aggregate cost of any such tail policy in respect of the
entire Tail Period exceed 600% of the Current Premium Amount.

  



  

(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations of such Person set forth in this
_Section 6.12_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective
heirs and representatives.

  



  

Section 6.13. _State Takeover Provisions_. The Company and the
Company Board shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no Takeover
Provision is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any Takeover Provision is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Takeover Provision on this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.15. _Excess Cash_. Upon receipt of written request from
Parent or Merger Sub on or after May 10, 2016, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause, including obtaining the necessary
Permits required in order to cause, each Company Subsidiary organized in a
non-U.S. jurisdiction to distribute all available cash to the Company (or to a
Company Subsidiary organized in the United States) before the Closing Date
(and shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in doing so and keep them

(iii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by (x) Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or (y) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , (B) at or prior to

Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
any Acquisition Proposal or the Company recommends or submits an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Stockholders for adoption (which, in each case, need

consummated, entered into, recommended or submitted pay the Company
Termination Fee to Parent (or one or more of its designees) by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent (or
its designee(s)); _provided_ , that for purposes of this  _Section

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ under circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for
all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including all fees and expenses of financing sources, counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub and their
Affiliates) actually incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or on their behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
investigation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), up to a
maximum amount of $2,750,000; _provided_ , that the payment by the Company of
the Parent Expenses pursuant to this  _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_ shall not relieve
the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ (except that such obligation shall be reduced

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion; _provided_ , that the payment by the Company of the Company
Termination Fee shall not relieve the Company from any liability or damage
resulting from a material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement. Parent shall have right to assign the right to
receive the Company Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole
discretion.

liability for any obligation or liability to the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect stockholders for any
claim for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments (other than RoundTable Healthcare Partners IV, L.P. or
RoundTable Healthcare Investors IV, L.P. for any breach of the Equity
Commitment Letter), or the failure of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
For the purpose of this _Section 8.2(c)_ , " _Parent Party_ " means,

transactions contemplated in this Agreement and (ii) without the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.2_ , the Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement.

Section 8.3. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
subject to  _Section 8.4_ , (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. No extension or waiver by the
Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless

Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time. No amendment of this
Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the

such Person to each of the other Parties in accordance with this _Section
9.2_.

  



  

Section 9.3. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  



  

Section 9.4. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

  



    

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, Parent Disclosure Letter, Company Disclosure Letter and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto), the Financing Commitments and the NDA
constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

Section 9.6. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof. Accordingly, in the event of
any breach by any Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 9.6_ shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction. Each Party further agrees that in the event of an
action by any other Party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it
will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy would be adequate or that
specific performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or
violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages are
adequate or any other grounds.

  



  

Section 9.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement shall be construed, performed and
enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of the Laws of
another jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Any Action against, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitments or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Merger) shall be brought solely
and exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; 
_provided_ , that if (and only after) such court determines that it lacks
subject matter jurisdiction over any such Action, such Action shall be
brought in the Federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment (subject to any
appeals therefrom) in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitments or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any Action arising out of or relating to such matters in any such court in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.7_. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 9.2_ (Notices). Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
required under the Debt Financing Commitments, the law of the State of New
York law shall apply (but, for the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect
to the definition, interpretation of the meaning and application of Company
Material Adverse Effect (or other similar event) and whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred, with respect to which issues, Delaware
law shall apply in all cases), and the Parties agree that New York State or
United States federal courts sitting in the borough of Manhattan, New York
City (and any New York State or United States Federal court from which appeal
therefrom may validly be taken) shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the
parties and over any such Action brought against any financing source under
the Debt Financing Commitments or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement, any Debt Financing Commitments or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the failure of
such transactions to be consummated, and nothing in this _Section 9.7_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to provide otherwise.

  



    

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which
may arise under this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments or the Equity
Financing Commitments is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Commitments, the Equity Financing Commitments or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each
Party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii)
each Party makes this waiver voluntarily and (iv) each Party has been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section_ _9.7(c)_.

  



  

Section 9.8. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not
intended to, and shall not, confer any rights, claims, Actions or
remedies upon any Person other than Company, Parent and Merger Sub (and their
respective successors and permitted assigns), except for following the
Effective Time, the rights of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
6.12_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and are for the sole
benefit of Company, Parent and Merger Sub. Any breaches of or inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver solely by the
Parties in accordance with _Section 8.3_ without notice or liability to any
other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of them
or any other Person. Accordingly, Persons other than the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.9. _No Recourse to Lenders_. Subject to the rights of the
parties to the Debt Financing Commitments under the terms thereof, none of
the parties hereto, nor any of their respective Affiliates, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any rights or
claims against any Lender or any Affiliate thereof (collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Sources_ "), solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing, and the Debt Financing
Sources, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall
not have any rights or claims against any Party hereto or any related Person
thereof, in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

  



  

Section 9.10. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; provided, that each of Parent and Merger Sub
may assign this Agreement or any of its rights (but not its obligations) to an
Affiliate of Parent or to any parties providing the Debt Financing (including
for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning
collateral in respect of such Debt Financing). No assignment by any Party
shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 9.11. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever
this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

  



  

Section 9.12. _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the Parties.

  



  

Section 9.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile and in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same agreement.

  



  

Section 9.14. _Delivery by Facsimile or E-mail_. This Agreement, and
any amendments hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder,
to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by
e-mail with facsimile or scan attachment, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any Party, each other Party shall re-
execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No
Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail to deliver
a signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by e-mail with facsimile
or scan attachment as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
Party forever waives any such defense.
