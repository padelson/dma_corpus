are filed with the SEC and mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further
agrees that all documents that such Party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to
form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other
applicable Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, makes any covenant with respect to any information
provided by the other for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any document that such first Party is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the Merger. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any event or circumstance
relating to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors which
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement (so that such document would not contain any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading) should be discovered by Parent or the Company, such Party shall promptly inform the other
Party and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose such event or
circumstance and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the
Company.</P>
