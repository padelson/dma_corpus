#### reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, together with interest on
the amount being paid from the Closing Date to the date of the payment at a
rate of six percent (6.0%) per annum, or (B) Parent shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, by which the Cash reflected on the Final Closing Statement is

#### 

  

#### (ii) either (A) Buyer shall pay to Parent the amount, if any, by which
the Debt reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less than the Debt

#### 

  

#### (iii) (A) if there was no adjustment to the Closing Payment pursuant to
subclause (iv) of Section 2.2(a) and the Net Working Capital reflected on the
Final Closing Statement is between $37,300,000 and $39,300,000, there shall
be no payment due under this Section 2.2(b)(iii); (B) if there was an
adjustment to the Closing Payment pursuant to subclause (iv) of Section
2.2(a) and the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Statement
is between $37,300,000 and $39,300,000, the amount by which the

shall be paid by Parent to Buyer (in the case where the Closing Payment
was increased) or by Buyer to Parent (in the case where the Closing Payment
was decreased); (C) if the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final
Closing Statement exceeds $39,300,000, Buyer shall pay to Parent the amount

plus any amounts by which the Closing Payment was increased pursuant to
subclause (iv) of Section 2.2(a)  or less any amounts by which the Closing
Payment was decreased pursuant to subclause (iv) of Section 2.2(a), as the
case may be (and if such adjustment results in a negative number, Buyer shall
return the difference to Parent), together in all such cases with interest on
the amount being paid from the Closing Date to the date of the payment at a
rate of six percent (6.0%) per annum.

  

#### 

  

The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause the satisfaction of their
respective obligations under this _Section 2.2(b)_ through a single payment
that takes into account the

  



  



        
   

  



  

net amount due to a Party under _subclauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of
this _Section 2.2(b)_. Any Party may make a payment pursuant to this 
_Section 2.2(b)_ prior to the determination of the Final Closing Statement
for the purpose of reducing the interest that it may be obligated to pay
under this _Section 2.2(b)_.

  



  

## 2.3 _Method of Payment_. All payments under _Section 2.2_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds free of costs and charges to
an account that the recipient, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
time for payment specified under _Section 2.2_, has designated.

  

## 

  

## 2.4 _Determination of Net Working Capital_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. Not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
an unaudited statement that shall set forth Parents good faith estimate of
the Cash, Debt, Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Net Working Capital
as of the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) _Preliminary Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent an unaudited
statement that shall set forth the Cash, Debt, Current Assets, Current
Liabilities and Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the "
_Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") in accordance with IFRS consistently
applied, as modified as set forth on _Exhibit 2.4(b)_. The Parties agree that
the adjustment payment contemplated by _Section 2.2(b)_ is intended solely
to reflect changes in the Cash, Debt, Current Assets and Current Liabilities
reflected on the statement set forth on _Annex A_ to _Exhibit 2.4(b)_
to the Effective Time and that any such change can be measured only if
the Preliminary Closing Statement is prepared using the same principles,
methods, policies, practices and procedures as were used in connection with
the preparation of the statement set forth on _Annex A_ to _Exhibit
2.4(b)_, provided such principles, methods, policies, practices and
procedures are in accordance with IFRS, as modified as set forth on _Exhibit
2.4(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Objection to Preliminary Closing Statement_. Within sixty (60) days
after the Preliminary Closing Statement is delivered to Parent pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)_, Parent shall complete its review of the Preliminary
Closing Statement. If Parent disagrees with any part of the Preliminary
Closing Statement, then Parent shall inform Buyer on or prior to the last day
of such sixty (60) day period by delivering a written notice to Buyer (a "
_Closing Statement Objection_ ") setting forth a description of the basis of
the Closing Statement Objection and the adjustments to the Cash, Debt,
Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Net Working Capital that
Parent believes should be made. If no Closing Statement Objection is
delivered to Buyer within such sixty (60) day period, then Parent shall be
deemed to have accepted the Preliminary Closing Statement.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Response to Closing Statement Objection_. If a Closing Statement
Objection is delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, then Buyer
shall have fifteen (15) days to review and respond to the Closing Statement
Objection by delivering written notice to Parent specifying the scope of its
disagreement with the information set forth in

  

### 

  



        
   

  



  

### it. If no such written notice is delivered to Parent within such fifteen
(15) day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Statement Objection.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Dispute Resolution Following Closing Statement Objection_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) _Negotiation_. If Buyer delivers a written notice to Parent in
response to a Closing Statement Objection pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_, then
Parent and Buyer shall promptly attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute
or disagreement relating to the Preliminary Closing Statement and
the calculation of the Cash, Debt, Current Assets, Current Liabilities or
Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Statement
Dispute_ ").

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Resolution by CPA Firm_. If Parent and Buyer are unable to resolve
the Closing Statement Dispute within forty-five (45) days after delivery of
a Closing Statement Objection to Buyer, then, at any time thereafter,
either Parent or Buyer may elect to have the Closing Statement Dispute
resolved by PricewaterhouseCoopers, **** or another internationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants as to which Parent and
Buyer mutually agree (the " _CPA Firm_ "), which shall, acting as an expert
and not as an arbitrator, determine on the basis of the standards set forth
in _Section 2.4(b)_, and only with respect to the remaining accounting-
related differences so submitted to the CPA Firm (and not by independent
review), whether and to what extent, if any, the Preliminary Closing
Statement requires adjustment.  In connection with the engagement of the CPA
Firm, each Party shall execute reasonable engagement letters and supply such
other documents and information as the CPA Firm reasonably requires or as
such Party deems appropriate. The CPA Firm shall be instructed to use every
reasonable effort to perform its services within fifteen (15) days after
submission of the Closing Statement Dispute to it and, in any case, as soon
as practicable after such submission. In resolving the Closing Statement
Dispute, the CPA Firm (A) shall utilize the criteria set forth in _Section
2.4(b)_ and (B) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by any Party, or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by any Party, as set forth in the Preliminary
Closing Statement and the Closing Statement Objection.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) _Payment of Fees of CPA Firm_. If the Adjustment Factor based on
the content of the Final Closing Statement is closer in amount to the
Adjustment Factor based on the content of the Closing Statement Objection
than to the Adjustment Factor based on the content of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, then Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in
connection with the services provided pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)(ii)_. If

### 

  

## 4.3 _Best Efforts; Cooperation_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Closing, each Party shall cooperate
with and assist the other Party, and shall use its reasonable best efforts,
to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents, and (ii) obtain and
maintain all approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations (including those set forth on
_Schedule 3.1(c)_ and _Exhibit 4.4_) required to be obtained from any other
Person or entity, including any Governmental Entity, that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that such assistance and efforts shall not include any
requirement of any Party or any of its Affiliates to expend any money (other
than expenses incurred in the ordinary course of

  



        
   

  



  

### business), incur any liability, commence any litigation or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person or entity other
than, in each case, as contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further,
that, without the prior written consent of Buyer, Parent may not commit any
Group Company to pay any material amount of cash or other consideration, or
incur or commit to incur any material liability, in connection with obtaining
such approval, consent or waiver. Neither Party shall take any action or
omit to take any action where such action or omission would reasonably be
expected to result in (A) the inability to satisfy any of the conditions set
forth in _Articles 6_ and _7_ or (B) a material delay in the satisfaction of
any of such conditions.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Certain Filings_. In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section
4.3(a)_, each Party shall (i) make all appropriate filings under all
applicable Regulatory Laws in the jurisdictions set forth on _Exhibit 6.7_
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (which filings shall be made in
any event within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) and
(ii) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any applicable
Regulatory Laws (or any Divestiture Order). Except for the fees associated
with the regulatory filings in South Africa, which shall be the
sole responsibility of Parent, Buyer shall pay all filing fees in
connection with the filings described in this _Section 4.3(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Cooperation; Best Efforts_. In connection with this _Section 4.3_,
each Party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, (i) cooperate in all
respects with the other Party in connection with any filing with, submission
to or investigation or inquiry of the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) promptly
inform the other Party of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental Entity and
of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) take all actions necessary to
obtain any required approvals of the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental
Entity (including approvals required by the Divestiture Orders) with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, to cause any applicable waiting
periods or review periods under Regulatory Laws of the jurisdictions set
forth on _Exhibit 6.7_ to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date
(and in any event within the first phase of review), to demonstrate in good
faith, at each of their respective cost and expense, that the transactions
contemplated hereby should be approved under Regulatory Laws and other Laws,
to secure the termination of any investigation by any Governmental Entity, to
avoid the filing of any suit or proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking
to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction or
temporary restraining or other Order in any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of restraining, preventing or delaying of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, all to the end of
expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limitation, Buyer shall agree to hold separate, divest, license, enter into a
consent agreement and/or assume any liability with regard to any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the
Ice Business (including entering into customary ancillary agreements relating
to any such divestiture of businesses, product

  



        
   

  



  

### lines or assets) as may be required by any applicable Governmental
Entity, in each case, to obtain any required approvals of the DOJ, the EC or
any other Governmental Entity (including approvals required by the
Divestiture Orders) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no action taken
by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 4.3(c)_ shall entitle Buyer to any
reduction of the Purchase Price, and, in connection with obtaining the
required approvals of any Governmental Entity under Regulatory Laws, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to (A) hold separate,
divest, license, enter into a consent agreement or assume any liability with
regard to any of its direct or indirect businesses, product lines or assets,
(B) take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom with respect to
any of the direct or indirect businesses, product lines or assets or (C) take
any other action that is not required by the Divestiture Orders. In addition,
each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate and consult
with the other in connection with the negotiation of any collective
bargaining, labor union or similar Contract with any labor union or similar
representative of a group of Transferred Employees. Each Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly inform the other Party upon receipt
of any material communication from any such labor union or
similar representative and shall permit such other Party and their
respective Affiliates and representatives to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any such labor union or similar representative to
the extent not prohibited by Law.

best efforts to procure the assignment of those Contracts described in

## 

  

## 4.5 _Intercompany Obligations_. At or prior to the Closing: (a)
Parent shall cause all intercompany trading accounts involving Parent or any
of its Affiliates (other than a Group Company), on the one hand, and any
Group Company, on the other hand, to be settled through cash payments;
provided, however, that Parent shall have no obligation to settle those
intercompany trading accounts between or among Group Companies and those
intercompany trading accounts set forth on _Exhibit 4.5_; (b) Parent
shall cause all other intercompany accounts involving Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than a Group Company), on the one hand, and any Group
Company, on the other hand, to be terminated without any requirement to
effect any type of cash payments; provided, however, that Parent shall have
no obligation to terminate those intercompany accounts between or among Group
Companies and those intercompany accounts set forth on _Exhibit 4.5_; and
(c) Parent shall cause all intercompany Contracts between Parent or any of
its Affiliates (other than a Group Company), on the one hand, and any Group
Company, on the other hand, to be terminated, except for those Contracts
described in _Exhibit 4.5_.  For the avoidance of doubt, no intercompany
accounts involving Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than a Group
Company), on the one hand, and any Group Company, on the other hand, will
survive the Closing, except for intercompany accounts between or among Group
Companies and those intercompany accounts set forth on _Exhibit 4.5_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 4.5_ shall affect
any obligations of the Italian Group Companies pursuant to _Section 5.5_ to
make payments to the Italian branch of Enodis Group UK. To the extent that
the intercompany trading accounts set forth on Exhibit 4.5 are not settled at
the Closing Date, such intercompany trading accounts shall be paid within
thirty (30) days.

other Party advised on a reasonably current basis, as to any litigation or
administrative proceeding pending and known to such Party or, to its
knowledge, threatened (i) against any Group Company or the Colorado Real
Property involving an amount in controversy in excess of $500,000 or (ii)
that challenges the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Error or Omission_.  Prior to the Closing, each Party shall notify
the other Party of: (a) any material notice or other communication received
by such Party or any of its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby in respect to those circumstances
in which the underlying contract, obligation or arrangement is material and
(b) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or any matter (including a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement) that would reasonably be expected to lead to the failure to
satisfy any of the conditions to Closing in _Article 6_ or _7_ , _provided_
, _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 4.6_
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party giving or
receiving such notice.

  

### 

  

## 4.7 _Employment Loss Notice_. At the Closing, Parent shall provide
Buyer with a list that discloses all Former Employees who have experienced an

Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Italian Group Companies to distribute to Affiliates of Parent (other than the
Group Companies) any cash held by the Italian Group Companies (taken as a
whole) in excess of 5 million in the aggregate and (ii) in no event shall
the Italian Group Companies (taken as a whole) have, as of the Effective
Time, an amount of cash less than 1 million in the aggregate.

# ** **

  

## 5.1 _Employee Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _General_. Buyer shall cause each Group Company to recognize all
service credited under the similar Benefit Plan through the Closing
for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement provided for the benefit of the Transferred Employees
after the Closing, without application of any

  



        
   

  



  

### preexisting condition or similar exclusion that did not apply to the
particular Transferred Employee prior to the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Health and Welfare Plans_. Except to the extent covered under any
Group Company Plan, Parent shall retain responsibility for and continue to
pay all medical, life insurance, disability, workers compensation and other
welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Former Employee, regardless of
when incurred, and for each Transferred Employee with respect to claims
incurred by such employees or their covered dependents prior to the Closing
Date. Expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by Transferred
Employees or their covered dependents on or after the Closing Date shall be
the responsibility of Buyer. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim
is deemed incurred by a Transferred Employee: (i) in the case of medical
or dental benefits, when the services that are the subject of the claim
are performed; (ii) in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs;
(iii) in the case of long-term disability benefits, when the disability
occurs; (iv) in the case of workers compensation benefits, when the event
giving rise to the benefits occurs; and (v) otherwise, at the time the
Transferred Employee or covered dependent becomes entitled to payment of a
benefit (assuming that all procedural requirements are satisfied and claims
applications properly and timely completed and submitted). From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Group Companies to, provide each
Transferred Employee with credit for any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid or incurred by such Transferred Employee prior to the Closing
(to the same extent such credit was given under the plans of Parent and its
Affiliates) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under the plan provided by Buyer or the Group Companies
for the 2009 plan year.

  

### 

  

### (c) _401(k) Plan_.  Buyer shall, or shall cause the Group Companies to,

deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Buyer s 401(k) Plan_") providing benefits immediately on and after the
Closing Date to the Transferred Employees. The Buyers 401(k) Plan will
expressly provide that the Transferred Employees who were participants in the
Enodis Corporation 401(k) Plan (the " _Enodis 401(k) Plan_") immediately
prior the Closing Date will become participants in the Buyers 401(k) Plan as
of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Enodis
Corporation shall cause the assets of the trust under the Enodis 401(k) Plan
in respect of the aggregate vested and unvested benefits accrued by the
Transferred Employees to be valued and transferred to the trust under the
Buyers 401(k) Plan. The assets to be transferred from the trust under the
Enodis 401(k) Plan pursuant to this _Section 5.1(c)_ shall be in cash or, to
the extent mutually agreed to by Parent and Buyer, in kind; provided,
however, any outstanding loans attributable to the accounts of
the Transferred Employees shall be transferred in kind. The actual amount
transferred from the trust under the Enodis 401(k) Plan shall be adjusted to
reflect any normal expenses or distributions properly attributable to the
Transferred Employees under the Enodis 401(k) Plan during the period
following the Closing Date. At the time the assets that are held in the
trust with respect to the Enodis 401(k) Plan are paid to the trust under the
Buyers 401(k) Plan pursuant to this _Section 5.1(c)_, the Buyers 401(k)
Plan shall assume all liabilities of the Enodis 401(k) Plan for the payment
of benefits transferred to the trust under the Buyers 401(k) Plan, and such

  



        
   

  



  

### transfer shall be in full discharge of all obligations of the Enodis
401(k) Plan in respect thereof; provided, however, neither Buyer nor the
Buyers 401(k) Plan shall assume any liability for failing to properly value
the accounts of the Transferred Employees under the Enodis 401(k) Plan or for
any other matter relating to the administration or the investment of the
assets of the Enodis 401(k) Plan. During the period following the Closing
Date and preceding the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this
_Section 5.1(c)_, Buyer will cooperate with and assist the Group Companies
in collecting and remitting to the trustee of the Enodis 401(k) Plan payroll
deductions relating to any outstanding loans, provided the participant shall
have first consented to such payroll reduction.  Notwithstanding the above,
the amount transferred to the trust under the Enodis 401(k) Plan shall in no
event be less than the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements of
Section 414(l) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (d) _COBRA_.  Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to any
Former Employee (and such individuals "qualified beneficiaries" within the
meaning of COBRA) whose "qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA)
occurs on or prior to the Closing with such COBRA continuation coverage as
any such individual has elected or may elect. Buyer shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, COBRA continuation coverage to any Transferred Employee
(and such individuals qualified beneficiaries) whose qualifying event occurs
after the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Required Notice_.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for, and shall
provide, any plant closing or similar notices as required under federal,
state, local or foreign Laws (including the WARN Act) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Cooperation_.  Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall provide Buyer
with all information relating to the Transferred Employees known by Parent
that Buyer reasonably requests for the purpose of facilitating compliance
with its obligations under _Sections 5.1(a)_ , _5.1(b)_ , _5.1(c)_ and
_5.1(d)_.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Right to Amend or Termination_. Nothing in this _Section 5.1_
is intended to interfere with the right of any Party or any of such
Partys Affiliates to amend any Benefit Plan, including Buyers right from
and after the Closing to amend or terminate any Group Company Plan, other
employee benefit plan or the employment of any Transferred Employee, which
right is expressly reserved.

  

### 

  

## 5.2 _Post-Closing Cooperation and Access to Information_. After
the Closing, each Party shall afford the other Party, its respective
counsel, accountants and other representatives, during normal business hours,
reasonable access to the books, records and other information in such Partys
possession relating directly or indirectly to the assets, liabilities or
operations of the Group Companies and the Colorado Real Property with respect
to periods prior to the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom at the expense of the requesting party, and shall otherwise
cooperate with such other Party at the expense of the requesting party, to
the extent such access and cooperation (a) is reasonably required by the
requesting Party for any proper business purpose and (b) is not reasonably
likely to adversely affect the ability of the disclosing Party to assert
attorney-client or attorney work-product privilege. Parent acknowledges that
a proper business purpose may include the preparation by

  



        
   

  



  

## Buyer or its representatives of necessary audited financial statements in
connection with any public offering or other financing contemplated by Buyer
or any Group Company, provided that Parent and its Affiliates shall have no
obligation under the preceding sentence other than to provide Buyer with
access to the aforesaid information to the extent such access is reasonably
required by the Buyer for such purpose (and the aforesaid information is
readily available to Parent or any of its Affiliates). Without limitation,
after the Closing, each Party shall make available to the other Party, as
reasonably requested, and to any Tax authority that is legally permitted to
receive the following pursuant to its subpoena power or its equivalent, all
books, records and other information relating to Tax liabilities or potential
Tax liabilities for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date and
shall preserve all such books, records and other information until
the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations for assessment or
refund of Taxes or extensions thereof. Subject to the previous sentence, for
a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, neither Party shall, or
permit its Affiliates to, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books,
records or other information described in this _Section 5.2_ without first
offering in writing to surrender such books, records and other information to
the other Party, which other Party shall have ten (10) days after such offer
to agree in writing to take possession thereof. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this _Section 5.2_, while the existence of an adversarial proceeding
between the Parties will not abrogate or suspend the provisions of this
_Section 5.2_, as to such records or other information directly pertinent to
such dispute, the Parties may not utilize this _Section 5.2_ but rather,
absent agreement, must utilize the rules of discovery.

  

## 

  

## 5.3 _Financial Statements for Italian Group Companies._ Prior to
the Closing Date, Parent shall cause each Italian Group Company to (a)
approve and file with the appropriate Italian Governmental Entity financial
statements for the fiscal period beginning on October 1, 2007 and ending on
September 30, 2008 and (b) have the Board of Directors approve the draft
financial statements for the fiscal period beginning on October 1, 2008 and
ending on December 31, 2008 and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain shareholder approval of such financial statements and make the
relevant filing with the appropriate Italian Governmental Entity. In the
event that the shareholder approval of such financial statements of an
Italian Group Company for the fiscal period beginning on October 1, 2008 and
ending on December 31, 2008 has not been obtained prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain the necessary
shareholder approval on or after the Closing Date. Each such financial
statement shall be prepared by the respective Italian Group Company in
accordance with Italian Accounting Principles, consistently applied.

for the Italian Consolidated Group with respect to the fiscal period
beginning on October 1, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2008, to be prepared
and to be filed with the appropriate Italian Governmental Entities by the
respective due dates set forth under Italian Tax Law. Buyer shall cause the

each Italian Group

  



        
   

  



  

### Company with respect to the fiscal period beginning on October 1, 2008
and ending on December 31, 2008, to be prepared and to be submitted to Parent

filing of the respective separate Italian Corporate Income Tax Return. Buyer
shall cause each such separate Italian Corporate Income Tax Return to be
filed with the appropriate Italian Governmental Entities by the due date set
forth under Italian Tax Law; provided, however, that the filing of any such
separate Italian Corporate Income Tax Return of an Italian Group Company
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Parent (such approval not
to be withheld unreasonably), it being understood that the lack of such
approval shall not prevent any Italian Group Company from filing each
separate Italian Corporate Income Tax Return within the date set forth under
Italian Tax Law. In connection with obtaining such approval, Buyer shall
cause each Italian Group Company to cooperate with Parent and to furnish to
Parent such additional information as may reasonably be requested by Parent
in connection with such review.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Payment of Taxes_.  Within ten (10) days after the filing of a

Italian Group Company had not been a member of a group filing a consolidated
Italian Corporate Income Tax Return, over (ii) the amount of estimated
Italian Corporate Income Tax in respect of such fiscal period that was paid
on or prior to the Closing Date by such Italian Group Company to the Italian
branch of Enodis Group UK; and

Group Company an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of

Italian branch of Enodis Group UK, over (ii) the amount of Italian Corporate
Income Tax the Italian Group Company would have had to pay to the Italian Tax
authorities for such fiscal period if such Italian Group Company had not been
a member of a group filing a consolidated Italian Corporate Income Tax
Return.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Amendments and Elections_. Without Parents prior written consent,
Buyer shall not take, and shall cause each Italian Group Company to not take,

consolidated Italian Corporate Income Tax Returns filed by the Italian
Consolidated Group, or the separate Italian Corporate Income Tax Returns
filed by the Italian Group Companies, for fiscal periods ending on or before
December 31, 2008.

## 5.6 _Tax Returns_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
with the appropriate federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies
all Tax Returns of the Group Companies (other than the Italian

Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (" _Consolidated Tax Returns_ ") for
periods of the Group Companies ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns (except to the extent included in the calculation of Debt or Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Time). Parent shall cause the income of
the Group Companies (other than the Italian Group Companies) including any
deferred items triggered into income by Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-13 and any
excess loss account taken into income under Treas. Reg. Section
1.1502-19) for periods of the Group Companies ending on or prior to the

### 

  

### (b) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all

preparation of any such Tax Returns. Parent shall be responsible, and
shall promptly reimburse the Buyer upon the Buyers request, for any U.S.
state or local income Taxes of a Group Company that are not payable on a
Consolidated Tax Return and any non-U.S. income Taxes (collectively, "
_Separate Return Income Taxes_ ") for (i) any Tax period that ends on the
Closing Date and (ii) the pre-Closing portion of any Tax period that begins
on or before and ends after the Closing Date, determined on the basis of an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date. Parent shall
be entitled to, and Buyer shall pay over to Parent promptly after receipt by
Buyer or the applicable Group Company, any Tax refunds received for Separate
Return Income Taxes for the Tax periods described in the preceding sentence.

  

### 

  

## 5.7 _Divestiture Orders_. Buyer acknowledges that it has received copies
of the Divestiture Orders.  Following the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates
shall not challenge the environmental, zoning or other permits relating to
the operations of the Group Companies and the Ice Business.

  



        
   

  



  

## 5.8 _Tax Proceedings_.

  

### 

  

### (a) _Italian Group Companies_. If an audit, investigation or
similar proceeding shall be commenced, or a claim shall be made, with respect
to any item reflected, or required to be reflected, in a separate Italian
Corporate Income Tax Return of an Italian Group Company for a fiscal period
ending on or before December 31, 2008, then Buyer shall provide Parent with
prompt written notice of such audit, investigation, similar proceeding or
claim (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), and Buyer shall have primary responsibility
for contesting such Tax Proceeding. In the event that such Tax Proceeding
results in the Italian branch of Enodis Group UK or any other Affiliate of
Parent being required to make a Tax payment to the Italian Tax authorities,
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for the amount of
any such payment. Subject to _Section 5.5_, if after the Closing Date there
is an adjustment of an item reflected, or required to be reflected, in a
separate Italian Corporate Income Tax Return of an Italian Group Company for
a fiscal period ending on or before December 31, 2008, and if such adjustment
results in the Italian branch of Enodis Group UK or any other Affiliate of
Parent receiving a Tax refund from the Italian Tax authorities, Parent shall
promptly remit such refund to Buyer.

### (b) _Other_. If a Tax Proceeding is commenced against any Group Company
by any Tax authority with respect to any Tax matter that may affect the
liabilities of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than a Tax Proceeding
described in _Section 5.8(a)_), then Buyer shall provide Parent with prompt
written notice of such Tax Proceeding. Parent shall have
primary responsibility for contesting such Tax Proceeding (including
selection of counsel, the pursuit or waiver of any administrative proceeding
or the right to contest the Tax Proceeding in any permissible manner);
provided, however, that (a) Buyer (or its advisors) may fully participate at
Buyers sole expense in the Tax Proceeding and (b) neither Party shall settle
the Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

### 

  

## 5.9 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall not,
and Parent shall cause its Affiliates, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective directors,
managers, officers, employees and agents not to, use any Proprietary
Information for any purpose, or disclose any Proprietary Information to any
Person other than Buyer or its Affiliates, except as necessary to comply with
(a) the terms of any agreement between Parent or any of its Affiliates and
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (b) any request by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or (c) any applicable Law or Order. If Parent or any of its
Affiliates or, to the knowledge of Parent, its or their respective directors,
managers, officers, employees and agents is required by law to disclose any
such information or documents as referred to in this _Section 5.9_, Parent
shall provide Buyer with prompt written notice before such disclosure

other appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure.

  

## 

  

## 5.10 _Use of Marks_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Use of Enodis Name and Mark_. Buyer acknowledges that, as between
Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand and Buyer and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, Parent and/or its Affiliates have the absolute and exclusive
proprietary right to the trademark, trade name and service mark "Enodis" and
any variation or derivation thereof and any corporate symbols or logos
related thereto (collectively, the " _Enodis Names_ ").  

  



        
   

  



  

### Except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Parent or one of its
Affiliates (other than a Group Company), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including each Group Company) not to, use the Enodis Names in
connection with the sale of any goods or services, on their respective signs,
purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads, products,
shipping documents, business cards and other materials or otherwise in the
conduct of its or their businesses (other than in a historical nature in
describing the transfer of ownership to Buyer); provided, however, that the
Group Companies may put into use such materials following the Closing Date if
such materials (i) were part of the inventory of the Group Companies as of
the Closing or (ii) constitute inventory subject to binding purchase orders
of the Group Companies as of the Closing, provided that, in each case, Buyer
shall cause the Group Companies to conspicuously note thereon that ownership
of the Ice Business as conducted by the Group Companies has transferred to
Buyer.

  

### ** **

  

### (b) _Use of Buyer Names and Marks_. Parent acknowledges that, as between
Parent and its Affiliates on the one hand and Buyer and its Affiliates on the
other hand, the Group Companies have the absolute and exclusive proprietary

derivations or any variation thereof and any corporate symbols or logos
related thereto (collectively, the " _Buyer Names_ "). Except as provided in
_Section 5.10(c)_, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
use the Buyer Names in connection with the sale of any goods or services, on
their respective signs, purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels,
letterheads, products, shipping documents, business cards and other materials
or otherwise in the conduct of its or their businesses (other than in a
historical nature in describing the transfer of ownership to Buyer);
provided, however, that Parent and its Affiliates may put into use such
materials following the Closing Date if such materials (i) were part of the
inventory of Parent and its Affiliates (excluding any Group Company) as of
the Closing, (ii) constitute inventory subject to binding purchase orders of
Parent or any of its Affiliates as of the Closing, or (iii) are provided by
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies)
to Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to one or more supply or distribution
agreements, or agreements of like nature, set forth on _Exhibit 4.5_,
including the provisions of the Transition Services Agreement providing for
the distribution of products of Buyer or its Affiliates by Parent or its
Affiliates.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Transitional License._ ** **Effective upon the Closing, Buyer (or
its appropriate Affiliate) hereby grants to Parent and its Affiliates a non-
exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Scotsman
mark (the " _Scotsman Mark_ ") for a period of one year from the Closing
Date (the " _Transition Period_ ") solely as part of the mark "Scotsman
Beverage Systems" throughout the world, except in the United States of
America, in connection with those beverage systems products and services that
are marketed or in active development by Parent or its Affiliates (other than
the Group Companies) as of the date of this Agreement.  Neither Parent nor
its Affiliates may (i) use the Scotsman Mark in conjunction with any other
mark owned by Buyer or its Affiliates, (ii) challenge the validity of the
Scotsman Mark or Buyers or its Affiliates ownership rights therein, (iii)
apply for registration of the Scotsman Mark or any mark confusingly

  



        
   

  



  

### similar thereto, (iv) use the Scotsman Mark in a manner likely to
jeopardize Buyers or its Affiliates rights therein or invalidate or impair
the Scotsman Mark, or (v) use the Scotsman Mark in any manner that would tend
to dilute the goodwill of the Scotsman Mark or materially harm or injure the
reputation of Buyer or its Affiliates. The nature and quality of all uses of
the Scotsman Mark by Parent and its Affiliates shall conform to or exceed
Buyers existing quality standards. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
neither it nor its Affiliates will acquire any ownership interest in or to
the Scotsman Mark by virtue of their use thereof and that all such use,
including any goodwill, shall inure to the benefit of Buyer or its Affiliate.
Immediately upon expiration of the Transition Period, Parent and its
Affiliates shall cease all use of the Scotsman Mark. For a period of three
(3) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall
cause its Affiliates not to, use or permit others to use the Scotsman Mark in
connection with any beverage systems products or services other than those
beverage system products or services marketed or sold by any Group Company as
of the Closing Date.

  

### ** **

  

## 5.11 _Insurance_. After the Closing:

  

## 

  

### (a) _General_.  Except as provided in _Section 5.11(b)_ or the
Transition Services Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of the Group Companies
shall have any right to make claims under insurance policies issued by third
parties that may have provided coverage to any Group Company, to the extent
the first named insured under such policies is any person or entity other
than such Group Company, whether the incident giving rise to any such claim
occurs prior to, on or after the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date,
insurance requirements of the Group Companies shall be the
sole responsibility of Buyer.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Certain Pre-Closing Events_. To the extent, however, that any claims
arise under separate insurance policies issued by third-party insurers and
owned by or covering any Group Company with respect to occurrences arising
prior to the Closing Date, such Group Company may make claims, through Parent
only, under such policies without regard to any other provision hereof, but
subject to such conditions set forth in any such policies, including all
reporting and notice requirements thereof, and solely for purposes of such
insurance policies, the liability of any Group Company with respect to such
claims shall be deemed to have been retained by the first named insured under
such policies to the same extent such first named insured would have had such
liability if the Closing had not taken place, it being expressly understood
and agreed that the foregoing shall not create any liability on the part of
such first named insured to the Group Companies with respect to the
satisfaction of such claim. Upon Buyers reasonable request to make a claim
under such policies, Parent shall be responsible to undertake, reporting and
administrative handling of such claim under such policies, provided that
Parent shall reasonably consider requests by Buyer to undertake a claim, and
shall consult with, and reasonably consider the comments provided by, Buyer
or the applicable Group Company in connection with all material reporting and
administrative handling acts. Except as set forth in _Section 5.20_, Buyer
and the Group Companies shall be jointly and severally responsible for, and
shall pay, all out of pocket expenses of Parent (including costs of
administration by Parent as well as fees and expenses of third parties
attributable to the handling of such claims) relating to services for claims
administration, investigation, appraisals and claim review incurred on or
after the Closing Date with

  



        
   

  



  

### respect to claims under such insurance policies. Except as set forth in
_Section 5.20_, Buyer and the Group Companies shall be responsible for, and
neither Buyer nor any Group Company shall have the right to make a claim
against Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to, any "self-insured"
or "self-funded" program of risk management or the amount of any deductible
or self-insured retention for any loss suffered by any Group Company prior
to, on or after the Closing Date, regardless of the date on which the claim
is made, provided however that the foregoing shall not affect Parents
retention of medical, life insurance, disability, workers compensation and
other welfare plan expenses and benefits pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Representations, Warranties or Covenants_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(s)_, Parent makes
no representations, warranties or covenants regarding the scope, availability
or amount of coverage under any insurance policy, and shall not have any
responsibility, and shall not be held liable, for the actions of the insurers
under insurance policies, including with regard to those claims submitted by
Parent on behalf of Buyer or any Group Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent agrees to provide to Buyer prior to Closing deductible
or retention amounts for those insurance policies set forth on _Schedule
3.1(s)._

  

### 

  

## 5.12 _Component Supply_. From time to time after the Closing, the Parties
shall cooperate to establish a commercially reasonable arrangement whereby
Parent or any of its Affiliates purchases goods under those Contracts (i)
described in _Exhibit 4.4_ that have not been assigned to Buyer prior to
the Closing (ii) described in _Exhibit 5.12_ and (iii) under which Parent
or any of its Affiliates purchases supplies and other products used in the
Ice Business for which alternate suppliers are not available as of the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Master Supply Agreements_ ") and resells
such goods to the Group Companies for the same price, and upon substantially
the same other terms, as Parent or its Affiliate purchased such goods under
the applicable Master Supply Agreement. The provisions of this _Section
5.12_ shall terminate with respect to the applicable Master Supply Agreement
upon the earliest of the following to occur: (a) the date on which Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, for this purpose, any Group Company) enters
into a Contract for the direct supply to any Group Company of the same or
substantially equivalent goods that are available to Parent or any of its
Affiliates under the applicable Master Supply Agreement; (b) the date on
which Buyer or any Group Company provides Parent with written notice of its
intent to discontinue the arrangement whereby any Group Company
purchases goods under the applicable Master Supply Agreement indirectly
through Parent or its Affiliates as described in this _Section 5.12_; (c)
the expiration of the applicable Master Supply Agreement in accordance with
the terms of such Master Supply Agreement as of October 6, 2008; or (d)
the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.

  

## 

  

## 5.13 _Plastic Auger Matters_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the Plastic Auger Assets shall be deemed jointly owned by Enodis Corporation
and Scotsman and (b) Enodis Corporation, Scotsman and their
respective Affiliates may license and use the Plastic Auger Assets for any
purpose; provided, however, that neither Enodis Corporation nor its
Affiliates shall license the Plastic Auger Assets or any portion thereof to
any Person (other than their respective Affiliates) that competes or is
likely to compete with the Ice Business. Neither Enodis Corporation nor
Scotsman shall sell, transfer or assign any interest in the Plastic Auger

  



        
   

  



  

## Assets without first giving the non-transferring party the right to
acquire such interest on the same or more favorable terms offered the
potential buyer. Neither Enodis Corporation or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, nor Scotsman or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall have a duty to
account to or share proceeds with the other on account of its exploitation of
the Plastic Auger Assets.  In the event that either Enodis Corporation or
Scotsman wishes to make any initial copyright or patent filing in any
jurisdiction, it shall notify the other party in writing at least sixty (60)
days prior to any such filing and obtain such partys consent to the filing,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All filings shall be at
the sole expense of the filing party (unless otherwise set forth in this
_Section 5.13_ or mutually agreed to in writing by the parties) and shall
reflect the joint ownership interests of both parties. All derivatives and
improvements of or to the Plastic Auger Assets shall be owned by the Party
creating such derivatives or improvements. Each Party shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, execute and deliver such instruments, and take such
action, as reasonably requested by the other Party to effect the intent of
the provisions of this _Section 5.13_.

  

## 

  

## 5.14 _Directors  and Officers Indemnity_. From the Closing Date until the
earlier of (x) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the
date on which Buyer or any of its Affiliates ceases to control the Group
Companies, Buyer shall:

  

## 

  

### (a) refrain, and cause the Group Companies to refrain, from (i)
voting any of the equity securities of the Group Companies in favor of any
claim or action against any and all of the past directors and statutory
auditors of the Group Companies (including, with respect to CastelMAC,
Frimont and Ice Works Milano S.r.l., pursuant to articles 2393, 2476 and 2407
of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) bringing directly any claim or action
against the same (including, with respect to CastelMAC, Frimont and Ice Works
Milano S.r.l., pursuant to articles 2393bis, 2395 and 2407 of the Italian
Civil Code); and

  

### 

  

### (b) indemnify and hold harmless, and cause the Group Companies to
indemnify and hold harmless, those directors, officers and statutory auditors
of the Group Companies that are resigning at the Closing from and against any
and all liabilities incurred in connection with any claim or action by any of
the Group Companies pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Closing, in each case, except for liabilities arising from the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of such directors, officers or
statutory auditors.

  

### 

  

The Parties agree that, if Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall merge or consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not
be the surviving entity or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors or assigns of Buyer
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.14_.

  



  

## 5.15 _Support Obligations_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _General_.  Buyer acknowledges that Parent and certain Affiliates of
Parent have provided support to the Group Companies pursuant to the credit
support obligations described in _Exhibit 5.15_ (the " _Support Obligations_
").

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) _Replacement_.  Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
effect, as of the Closing Date, the full and unconditional release of Parent
and its Affiliates from the Support Obligations, including by:

  

### 

  

#### (i) offering to provide substitute guarantees with terms no less
favorable to the counterparty than the terms of the guarantees existing on
the date of this Agreement; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute letters of
credit containing terms and conditions that are substantially identical to
the terms and conditions of the letters of credit existing on the date of
this Agreement and from lending institutions that have a credit rating
commensurate with or better than that of lending institutions for the letters
of credit existing on the date of this Agreement; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) offering to institute substitute escrow arrangements with terms no
less favorable to the counterparty than the terms of the then existing escrow
arrangements; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute surety or
performance bonds issued by a Person or entity having a net worth or a credit
rating at least equal to those of the issuer of surety or performance bonds
existing on the date of this Agreement, and which replacement surety or
performance bond contains terms and conditions that are
substantially identical to the terms and conditions of surety or performance
bonds existing on the date of this Agreement; and

  

#### 

  

#### (v) using its reasonable best efforts to replace any other security
agreement or arrangement on substantially identical terms and conditions to
the security agreement or arrangement existing on the date of this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Letter of Credit Support_. If Buyer does not obtain the complete
and unconditional release of Parent and its Affiliates from the Support
Obligations prior to the Closing, then, no later than thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date (the " _Support Date_ "), Buyer shall pay for and provide
Parent and its Affiliates with an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank
and in a form acceptable to Parent, in its reasonable discretion, in an
amount equal to the amount that may be drawn against Parent and its
Affiliates if claims are made under the Support Obligations.  Furthermore,
for so long as any Support Obligation remains outstanding, Buyer shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including, for this purpose, the Group
Companies) not to, effect any amendments, modifications or other changes to
the contracts or other obligations to which such Support Obligation relates
or take any other action, in either case, that would increase the liability
of Parent and its Affiliates under any Support Obligation, without Parents
prior written consent.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Reimbursement_.  If Parent or any of its Affiliates is required to
make any payment under or with respect to any Support Obligation, then Buyer
shall reimburse

  



        
   

  



  

### Parent and its Affiliates for such payment within two (2) Business Days
after Parent provides Buyer with written notice thereof.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Termination_.  Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Support Obligations to terminate and
redeliver to Parent each original guarantee, letter of credit or other
instrument constituting or evidencing the Support Obligations in connection
with the replacement thereof in accordance with _Section 5.15(b)_ or
_5.15(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
and its Affiliates, in their sole discretion, may terminate any and all
Support Obligations at any time after the Support Date and the only
obligations of Parent and its Affiliates prior to doing so will be to provide
five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Buyer.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Cooperation_.  Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may contact and have

or discussion.

  

### 

  

## 5.16 _Direction and Coordination Activities_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Indemnity_.  From the Closing Date until the earlier of (x) the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the date on which Buyer
or any of its Affiliates ceases to control the Group Companies, Buyer shall:

  

### 

  

#### (i) refrain, and cause the Group Companies to refrain, from bringing any
claim or action against Enodis Group UK or any of its Affiliates pursuant to
Article 2497 of the Italian Civil Code; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) indemnify and hold harmless, and cause the Group Companies to
indemnify and hold harmless, Enodis Group UK or any of its Affiliates from
and against any and all liabilities incurred in connection with any such
claim or action by the Group Companies, in each case, except for liabilities
arising from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Enodis Group UK or
any of its Affiliates.

  

#### 

  

The Parties agree that, if Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall merge or consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not
be the surviving entity or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors or assigns of Buyer
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.16_.

  



  

### (b) _Notification_.  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall procure that each of the Italian Group Companies
notifies the competent Italian Governmental Entities of the cessation of the
direction and coordination activity by Enodis Group UK pursuant to article
2497-bis of the Italian Civil Code.

  



         
 

  

## 

  

## 5.17 _Third Party Confidentiality Agreements_. Except in those
cases where the Group Companies are expressly third party beneficiaries under
the relevant agreements, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
assign or cause the assignment to Buyer, effective upon the Closing, of
Parents or its Affiliates rights under any confidentiality agreement or
similar agreement pursuant to which information or due diligence items that
relate to the Group Companies or the Ice Business were provided to any Person
in connection with the sale of the Ice Business pursuant to the Divestiture
Orders to which Buyer or the Group Companies are not third-party
beneficiaries; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to expend
any money (other than expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business),
incur any liability, commence any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person in connection with any
such assignment.

  

## 

  

## 5.18 _Certain Ice Business Obligations_. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Group Companies to pay, perform and discharge, as and when
due, those obligations arising under the Contracts described in _Exhibit
5.18_ (except as otherwise set forth therein) that relate to the Ice
Business, including goods and services manufactured or sold as part of the
Ice Business prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

  

## 

  

## 5.19 _IP Transfers_. Parent and its Affiliates shall, at their expense,
take all steps necessary to ensure the transfers contemplated by _Section
4.2(b)_ are reflected in all appropriate administrative offices.

  

## 

  

## 5.20 _Product Liability_. Buyer agrees that the Group Companies shall be
solely responsible for, and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to pay
all expenses or damages related to product liability claims alleging bodily
harm, tangible property damage (other than damage to the product at issue)
or financial loss arising out of the manufacture of any product by the
Group Companies incurred by the Group Companies prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that Parent shall reimburse the applicable Group Company
for 50% of (i) any out-of-pocket payments made by such Group Company to a
claimholder arising out of such claims and (ii) all out of pocket expenses of
the applicable Group Company (including costs of administration by the
applicable Group Company as well as fees and expenses of third parties
attributable to the handling of such claims) relating to services for claims
administration, investigation, appraisals and claim review incurred on or
after the Closing Date with respect to such product liability claims (such
amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Reimbursable Expenses_ ");
provided, however, that Parents reimbursement obligation under this _Section
5.20_ shall not commence until the aggregate amount of Reimbursable Expenses
equals or exceeds the product liability accrual reflected on the Final
Closing Statement (and thereafter Parents reimbursement obligation shall be
limited to 50% of the Reimbursable Expenses that exceed the amount of such
product liability accrual). For purposes of the foregoing, a claim is
deemed incurred by a Group Company when the event giving rise to such
liability occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the foregoing provisions
do not extend to product warranty claims, and (B) the Parties agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.11_ or this _Section
5.20_, (x) Parents obligations relating to claims administration shall be
limited to the reporting and administration of insurance claims under
applicable insurance policies and (y) Buyer shall be solely responsible for
all other aspects of the administration of any claim made by a claimant,
including legal defense and other matters.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 5.21 _Scotsman Shanghai_. Except to the extent paid prior to
Closing, Parent shall reimburse Scotsman Shanghai for any and all expenses
and liabilities incurred by Scotsman Shanghai in connection with the transfer
out of Scotsman Shanghai of any and all assets and liabilities related to
the non-Ice Business, including, but not limited to, liabilities attributable
to non-Ice Business product warranties issued by Scotsman Shanghai prior to
the Closing Date, and the termination of any employees of Scotsman Shanghai
who do not perform services primarily related to the Ice Business.

  

## 

  

## 5.22 _Accounts Receivable Guaranty_. Parent shall guaranty the collection
of the accounts receivable of the Ice Business on the terms set forth in this
_Section 5.22_; provided, however, that, as used in this _Section 5.22_,
the terms "Ice Business" and "Group Companies" shall be deemed to exclude
Scotsman Shanghai. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall permit Parent to
obtain and retain a copy of an aged accounts receivable report of the Ice
Business as of the Effective Time. After the Closing, Buyer shall cause
the Group Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
past practices to collect the accounts receivable of the Ice Business. Within
the later of ten (10) days after the determination of the Final Closing
Statement and two hundred ten (210) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Receivables Statement_ ")
that shall set forth a detailed list of all accounts receivable included in
Current Assets in the Final Closing Statement (i) that were not collected on
or before the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date (the " _Cutoff Date_ ") and (ii) as to which Buyer is seeking payment
hereunder, together with reasonable supporting documentation (the "
_Uncollected Receivables_ "). Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal
to the aggregate of all Uncollected Receivables, less the amount of any
accounts receivable reserve included in the Final Closing Statement. Such
payment shall be made promptly and in any case within five (5) Business Days
after the receipt by Parent of the Receivables Statement. Upon receipt
of such payment, Buyer shall assign to Parent all of its right, title and
interest in and to all of the Uncollected Receivables, and Parent shall have
the right to pursue collection of any and all of the Uncollected Receivables
that remain uncollected and in connection therewith shall have the ability to
contact customers and pursue other collection efforts in connection with
collecting such Uncollected Receivables. In the event Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives any payment in respect of any Uncollected Receivable for
which payment from Parent is received in respect of this guaranty, Buyer
shall promptly remit, or cause the remittance of, such payment to Parent.
Buyer shall make all reasonable efforts to apply payments of accounts
receivables received by the Group Companies after the Effective Time to the
corresponding invoice issued to the customer. All payments of accounts
receivable received by the Group Companies after the Effective Time shall be
applied so as to retire accounts receivable in chronological order based upon
the period of time such accounts receivable have existed on the books of the
Group Companies; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to any account receivable as to which there is a good faith dispute
evidenced by documentation, in which case such account receivable shall be
retired upon resolution of such dispute and payment in respect thereof.

  

## 

  

## 5.23 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date, upon
request of the other Party and without further consideration, each
Party shall execute and deliver to the requesting Party such documents and
take such action as the requesting Party reasonably requests to consummate
more effectively the intent and purpose of the Parties under this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

## 

  

## 8.3 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification Among Parent and Buyer_.
 Following the discovery of any facts or conditions that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Loss or Losses for which indemnification
under this _Article 8_ can be obtained, the Person seeking
indemnification under this _Article 8_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall,
within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written notice to the Party from
whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), setting forth
the specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail, relating to such
Loss or Losses, the amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-binding, reasonable
estimate thereof if the actual amount is not known or not capable of
reasonable calculation) and the specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon
which the Indemnified Party is relying in seeking such indemnification (an "
_Indemnification Notice_ "). Except as otherwise set forth in _Section
8.1(b)_, an Indemnified Partys failure to provide an Indemnification Notice
within the time period specified above shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from its indemnification obligations with respect to the subject of the
Indemnification Notice, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

  

## 

  

## 8.4 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Notice_. In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by any third party, including any Governmental Entity
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party must provide an
Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying Party relating to the Third Party
Claim as soon as possible after the Indemnified Partys receipt of notice of
the Third Party Claim, but in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter
and in no event more than five (5) Business Days after being served with any
summons, complaint or similar legal process. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5)
Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents, including all court papers, received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.  Except as otherwise
set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_, an Indemnified Partys failure to provide an
Indemnification Notice within the time period specified above shall not

act or omission of any Governmental Entity that renders this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby insufficient to satisfy the
Divestiture Orders, and such Order or other action shall have become final

### 

  

provided, however, that if a Party seeking termination pursuant to _subclause
(b)_ of this _Section 10.1_ is in breach in any material respect of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement or
if such Partys failure to fulfill any of such Partys material obligations

Confidentiality Agreement) shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that termination shall not relieve any Party from liabilities for

covenants set forth in this Agreement.
