 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Company certificate of incorporation shall be amended and restated so as to be materially similar to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Agilysys NJ, Inc., and as so amended and restated such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended. 

  

 (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended. 

  

 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until the earlier of their respective deaths, resignations or removals or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 1.6 _Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock, each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and shares, if any, of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has complied with the requirements of the 

   ##### 

  

    

NJBCA (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")) shall be canceled and extinguished and
converted into the right to receive such portion of the Merger Consideration
as set forth on Annex I attached hereto pursuant to the procedures set forth
in _Section 1.7_ hereof. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, but
prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to Parent a schedule (the "
_Allocation Spreadsheet_ ") showing, among other matters, (i) the amount of
cash to be received by each holder of Company Capital Stock at the Effective
Time as provided for in this  _Section 1.6(a)_ based on the formulas set

Capital Stock held by each stockholder. 

  

 (b) _Adjustments to Conversion Ratios_. The amount of cash into which each share of Company Capital Stock is to be converted as set forth in Annex I shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Capital Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 (d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the allocable portion of the Merger Consideration as set forth in _Annex I_ but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to applicable Law. The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required under applicable Law, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such purchase demand made by any holder of Dissenting Shares (" _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") under applicable Law.

Each Dissenting Stockholder who, pursuant to the provisions of applicable Law, becomes entitled to payment of the " _fair value_ " for their shares of Company Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Parent shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such stockholder of certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under this _Section 1.6_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.7 _Payment Procedures_  

  

 (a) Parent shall (i) acting as payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "), make available, no later than five (5) days after the Closing, in exchange for shares of the Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as set forth on Annex I minus the Escrowed Amount, (ii) at the Closing, deliver to the Escrow Agent, Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the " _Escrowed Amount_ "), and (iii) at the Closing, deliver to each holder of record of shares of Company Capital Stock that were converted into the right to receive cash (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (including an accompanying Substitute Form W-9) (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Company Certificate_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of the Letter of Transmittal and the Company Certificates to the Payment Agent), which Letter of Transmittal shall specify, among other things, the appointment of the Stockholder Representative under _Section 7.4_ of this Agreement and shall include, among other things, representations that such holder owns, of record and beneficially, the Company Capital Stock evidenced by the Company Certificate surrendered by such holder to the Payment Agent for payment and that such holder has the power and authority to execute and deliver such Letter of Transmittal and Company Certificate and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration. Parent shall be responsible for the fees and expenses incurred as a result of its actions as Payment Agent. 

  

 (b) The Escrow Amount shall be deposited into escrow with the Escrow Agent and subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, subject to release as described in _Section 1.8_ below. 

  

 (c) Upon surrender of Company Certificates to the Payment Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal (including the accompanying Substitute Form W-9), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and _Annex I_ , and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented one or more shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and _Annex I_. 

  

 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered has been properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange has paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable. 

  

 (e) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this _Section 1.7_ shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations of Parent under this  _Section 1.7_ shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the cash amount which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and _Annex I_. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Payment Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any earnings received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Payment Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) and only as general creditors thereof with respect to the portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Payment Agent will be liable to any holder of a Company Certificate for the portion of the Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Parent or the Payment Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such withholding taxes as Parent or the Payment Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Payment Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Payment Agent. 

  

 1.8 _Indemnification Escrow_. The Escrow Amount shall be deposited into an interest bearing escrow account with the Escrow Agent and shall be subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement and shall remain in escrow until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Indemnity Release Date_ ") or until it is paid to a Parent Indemnitee (by reason of a Working Capital Shortfall (as defined in _Section 1.9_ below) or an indemnification claim under _Section 7.2_ below); _provided_ , that upon the Indemnity Release Date, an amount equal to the difference between (a) the remainder of the Escrow Amount and (b) the then-applicable Reserve Amount shall be promptly released by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to the holders of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes hereof, the term " _Reserve Amount_ " shall mean the sum of any amounts set forth in any Indemnification Notices or Claim Notices provided pursuant to  _Section 7.3_ hereof which describe in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any such claim or claims (provided, however, that if any such notice includes a good faith statement that the relevant Parent Indemnitee is not reasonably capable of determining a material portion of the potential Losses from such claim or claims, the Reserve Amount shall be: (i) if the maximum potential Losses can be reasonably estimated in good faith by the relevant Parent Indemnitee, the maximum amount of such potential Losses or (ii) if such maximum amount cannot be reasonably estimated in good faith (such assertion to be supported by a letter from the relevant Parent Indemnitees outside counsel), the full balance remaining in the Escrow Account), with each 

   ##### 

  

    

such Claim being deemed a part of the Reserve Amount until the final
disposition of the Claim or Claims underlying such amounts. 

  

 1.9 _Working Capital Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) As used herein, " _Working Capital_ " shall mean the Companys working capital as defined in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with that used by the parties hereto in determining the Working Capital Target as set forth on _Section 1.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. The specific components of and guidelines for determining the Working Capital shall be as described and set forth on said _Section 1.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of this _Section 1.9_, the " _Working Capital Target_ " shall be $8,800,000. 

  

 (b) Contemporaneously with Parents post-Closing delivery of the financial statements of the Company and Surviving Corporation as part of its required Form 8-K filing as specified in Rule 3-05(b) of Regulation S-X, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Preliminary Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Closing Working Capital. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be prepared as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date on a basis consistent with the methodology set forth in this _Section 1.9_. All expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be the responsibility of Parent. In preparing the Preliminary Adjustment Statement it shall be assumed that the Business shall be continued as a going concern and there shall not be taken into account any of the plans, transactions or changes that Parent intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made at or after the Closing Date with respect to the Business. 

  

 (c) The Stockholder Representative or his designees and agents shall be entitled to review the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and any working papers and similar materials relating to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement prepared by Parent or its accountants. Parent also shall provide the Stockholder Representative with timely access, during normal business hours, to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Surviving Corporation and all other information reasonably requested, to the extent related to the determination of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The Stockholder Representative agrees to keep any and all such information received by him confidential and not to disclose such information or otherwise use it for any purposes other than reviewing the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and to resolve any disputes with respect to the foregoing. 

  

 (d) The Stockholder Representative shall review the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent, in writing, any objection or dispute thereto which the Stockholder Representative may have with respect to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. If the Stockholder Representative fails to make a timely objection to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the Stockholder Representative will be deemed, on behalf of the Company Stockholders to have accepted the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. If the Stockholder Representative makes a timely objection to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, and Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve their disputes within fifteen (15) days after the objection of the Stockholder Representative, the dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants. The determinations of the Independent Accountants shall be final, binding and conclusive to Parent, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company Stockholders and their respective Affiliates, 

   ##### 

  

    

successors, assigns or heirs. The fees, expenses and disbursements of the
Independent Accountants (i) shall be borne by the Company Stockholders and
payable from the Escrow Amount in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of such disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed
by the Stockholder Representative bears to the aggregate dollar amount
of such items so submitted and (ii) shall be borne by Parent in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted that are successfully disputed by the Stockholder Representative
bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted. 

  

 (e) The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall become the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ " unless timely and properly disputed or objected to by the Stockholder Representative in accordance with _Section 1.9(d)_ above or otherwise as determined by the Independent Accountants, and, as such, shall become final, binding and conclusive upon Parent, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company Stockholders and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns or heirs for all purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 1.9_, " _Closing Working Capital_ " means the Working Capital reflected on the Final Adjustment Statement. 

  

 (f) If the Closing Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target (a " _Working Capital Shortfall_ "), the Company Stockholders shall pay to Parent the amount of such Working Capital Shortfall, which payment shall be made, without interest, by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Escrow Amount. If the Closing Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital Target (a " _Working Capital Excess_ "), Parent shall pay such Working Capital Excess, without interest, to the Payment Agent. The Payment Agent shall then promptly distribute the amount of any Working Capital Excess received from Parent such that each Company Stockholder shall receive an amount equal to: (x) the Working Capital Excess _multiplied by_  (y) a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder as of the Effective Time, and (ii) the denominator of which is the aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of held by all of the Company Stockholders as of the Effective Time. For Tax purposes, any payment by under this _Section 1.9_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 1.10 _Performance Based Consideration Provisions_. In addition to the Merger Consideration, Parent will pay to the Payment Agent for distribution to each Company Stockholder in the same allocation and same manner as the Merger Consideration, an amount equal to the " _Additional Consideration_ " as determined pursuant to the terms of the Earnout Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Earnout Agreement_ "), which Additional Consideration in no event will exceed Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000). 

  

 1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an 

   ##### 

  

    

affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the portion of the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and _Annex I_ with respect
to shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such certificates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance and payment thereof, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to deliver to Parent
an affidavit of loss, theft or destruction in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the posting by such owner of a bond, in such amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, affiliates or agents with respect to Company
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 1.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. At any time after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take such further action as may be reasonably requested by Parent which is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Parent with control over, and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to, all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company.

employees shall participate in any such plan to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Surviving Corporation (except as my be prohibited

   #####

has been given to the party from whom recovery is sought; provided that if
any such notice is timely given, the claim to which such notice relates may
continue to be asserted beyond the Expiration Date.

   

 7.2 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations of this _Article VII_, Parent, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, control persons and affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") shall be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless, jointly and severally, solely from amounts contained in the Escrow Fund (except in the case of a claim based upon the breach of a representation, warranty or covenant which was made fraudulently, for which there shall be no limitation), for any and all Losses (whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, as defined in _Section 7.3_), incurred, sustained or accrued by such Parent Indemnitee as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of (A) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement; (B) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement; (C) any claims for indemnification or similar reimbursement pursuant to the Company certificate of incorporation, by-laws or any contractual obligation, by any current or former director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) any Audit by Sun relating to the operation of the Company or the Business prior to the Closing Date, (E) any claim relating to the ownership of Clique or Verifichi or the Dispositions thereof, and (F) any claim of any former or current holder of Company Capital Stock or any other security of the Company arising out of this Agreement and any agreements executed in connection hereunder and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, (i) as a result of the exercise of any appraisal rights (net of any amount that would have been otherwise payable to any holder of Dissenting Shares exercising appraisal rights pursuant to this Agreement, solely to the extent that such amounts have been returned to Parent), but not including claims relating to rights expressly provided to current stockholders under the express terms of this Agreement, (ii) any claims for indemnification or similar reimbursement pursuant to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or any contractual obligation, by any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) any Liability to the Paying Agent (including any indemnification obligations) resulting, directly or indirectly, from any action or inaction taken by the Company (prior to the Closing) or any Company shareholder or resulting or arising out of information provided by the Company (prior to the Closing) or any Company shareholder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement). 

  

 (b) _Limitations on Liability_. 

  

 (i) Except for any claims based upon fraud or related to the representations or warranties contained in Section 2.1, 2.3, 2.8(c), 2.10 or 2.20, as to which this subsection (b) shall not apply, the Company shall not have any liability under _Section 7.2(a)(A)_ unless and until the aggregate Losses incurred or sustained by all Parent Indemnitees taken together exceeds $250,000 (the " _Basket_ "), at which time payment shall be made for all Losses incurred or sustained by Parent Indemnitees exceeding such Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , no payment shall be made with respect to any individual Loss of less than $50,000 (the " _De_  

   ##### 

  

  

 _Minimis Amount_ "), it being understood that any related Losses or Losses
arising out of similar facts or circumstances shall be considered as one
individual Loss for purposes of determining whether the De Minimis Amount has
been satisfied and it being further understood that for any such Loss
exceeding such De Minimis Amount, a payment shall be made for the full amount
of such Loss, subject to the Basket. Except as otherwise set forth herein or
for claims based upon the breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
which was made fraudulently (which may be made by set-off against any
Additional Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of the
Earnout Agreement), Parent Indemnities shall not be entitled to be
indemnified under _Section 7.2(a)_ in excess of the unreleased portion of
the funds in the Escrow Account.

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is limited or qualified by "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or by any similar term or limitation, the occurrence of a breach or inaccuracy of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as the case may be, and the amount of Losses subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined as if "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or limitation were not included therein. 

  

 7.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted in good faith by notice by the person seeking indemnification hereunder to the Stockholder Representative, in the case of a Parent Indemnitee, or the Parent, in the case of a Company Stockholder Indemnitee (an " _Indemnification Notice_ "). 

  

 (b) With regard to third-party claim that may give rise to any indemnification obligation under this Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), all claims for indemnification by any indemnified party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") hereunder shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this _Section 7.3_. In the event that any claim or demand by a third party for which indemnification (the recipient of the Indemnification Notice being an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be obtained hereunder (a " _Claim_ ") is threatened, asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall timely notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Claim, described in reasonable detail (to the extent practicable), and the amount or a good faith estimate (to the extent practicable) of the amount thereof (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Claim) (the " _Claim Notice_ "). The failure of the Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnification obligations under this _Section 7.3_ unless and only to the extent of any actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party may at any time elect to defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnified Party against any such Third Party Claim, except that this sentence shall not apply unless (i) the applicable Third Party Claim involves solely a claim for monetary damages and (ii) such claim does not involve the business reputation of the Parent or its Affiliates, or the possible criminal culpability of the Parent or its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors or employees. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected without Indemnified Partys consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, unreasonably delayed or unreasonably conditioned), unless (x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any Law or any violation of the 

   ##### 

  

    

rights of any Person, (y) the sole relief provided is monetary damages which
damages are fully subject to indemnification hereunder and (z) the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim provides an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Parties. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying
Party in defending such Claim shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by,
the Indemnifying Party and shall not be deemed Losses for purposes of
_Section 7.2(a)_. If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in any
such defense it may do so at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the reasonable costs and expenses of one counsel (in addition
to any local counsel) to the Indemnified Party will be indemnifiable
hereunder if, in the reasonable view of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and any
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not exercise such right to
assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense thereof by
counsel of the Indemnified Partys choice and the Indemnified Party will be
permitted, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_, to
recover all Losses incurred or sustained as a result of such Third Party
Claim; provided that it shall defend the Claim in good faith, keep the
Indemnifying Party fully apprised of all developments relating to the matter,
and shall provide at least ten (10) calendar days prior written notice to
the Indemnifying Party of any proposed compromise or settlement. 

  

 (c) Any indemnification payable under this _Article VII_ shall be, to the extent permitted by Law, an adjustment to the Merger Consideration. Except as otherwise set forth herein, including _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, the indemnification obligation rights set forth in this  _Article VII_ shall be satisfied solely by the Escrow Fund. 

  

 7.4 _Stockholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) The Named Stockholder is hereby appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Company Stockholders (the " _Stockholder Representative_ "), to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to, negotiate and enter into settlements and compromises of claims, to demand, prosecute and defend claims arising out of this Agreement and to comply with orders of courts and determinations and awards with respect to claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the Company Stockholders from time to time upon not less than ten (10) calendar days prior written notice to Parent. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative shall be filled by a majority-in-interest of the Company Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative may resign upon ten (10) calendar days prior written notice to Parent and the Company provided that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor Stockholder Representative. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each Company Stockholder. Each Letter of Transmittal executed by the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 1.7_ hereof shall include an express agreement on behalf of such Company Stockholder to the appointment of the Named Stockholder to act as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of such Company Stockholder in accordance with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to matters relating to (i) the indemnification provisions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof and (i) the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.8_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not have any Liability to the Company Stockholders for any action taken or suffered by it or omitted by it hereunder as Stockholder Representative, except as caused by the Stockholder Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel and the Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Company Stockholders for anything done, omitted or suffered by the Stockholder Representative based on such advice. The Stockholder Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 (c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative in a matter entrusted to the Stockholder Representative by this Agreement shall be deemed to have been taken or given on behalf of all Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all Company Stockholders, and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of, and binding on, each of the Stockholder Representatives. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Representatives are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, including _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ , following the Effective Time, the Escrow Fund shall be the sole source of remedy for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company under this Agreement, except only for the remedies of injunctive relief or specific performance.

 8.6 _Remedies Cumulative_.

   ##### 

  

  

 8.7 _Governing Law_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement and all matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New Jersey or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New Jersey. 

  

 (b) All Legal Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any state or federal court sitting in the State of New Jersey, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Legal Proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the state described in the preceding sentence and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. 

  

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.7(c)_.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege 

   ##### 

  

    

hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

  

 8.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and, except for the rights of the Parent Indemnitees as set forth in Article VII as to which they are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries, it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any such rights, upon any other Person. 

  

 8.10 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for the sole purpose of convenience of reference, and shall not in any way limit or affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder without proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a partys breach of its obligations but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
