shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of

          (e)  Transfers of Ownership.  If certificates representing shares of
               ----------------------
Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificates

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

          (f)  Required Withholding.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
               --------------------

consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

          (g)  No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
               ------------
Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor

any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.8  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares of
          ---------------------------------------------------
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) or Section 1.7(d)
                                         --------------    --------------

pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, at any time following the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.
                                  ---------

          --------------------------------------
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall

making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
                                                                         -------
1.6 hereof, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
---
Section 1.6(f) hereof and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to

--------------
may, in their discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and other
distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates
to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

     3.6  SEC Filings.
          -----------

          (a)  Parent has made available to the Company a correct and complete
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy
statement filed by Parent with the SEC on or after July 1, 1999 and prior to the
date of this Agreement (the "Parent SEC Reports"), which are all the forms,
                             ------------------
reports and documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC since such
date. The Parent SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
(ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of Parent's subsidiaries is required to file any reports or
other documents with the SEC.

          (b)  Each set of consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports was
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements, do not contain footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q
of the Exchange Act) and each fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its subsidiaries at the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for
the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements
were or are subject to normal adjustments which were not or are not expected to
be material in amount.

     3.7  Absence of Changes.  Since June 30, 2000, there has not been any
          ------------------
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

     3.8  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  None of the
          --------------------------------------------------
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; and (ii)
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the dates mailed to the stockholders of
Company, at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting and as of the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent makes no representation or warranty with

                                     -32-

respect to any information supplied by the Company which is contained in any of
the foregoing documents.

Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its

the approval of the Merger, and shall take all other commercially reasonable
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or Delaware Law to obtain
such approvals. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders'
Meeting (i) if and to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the
Company's stockholders in advance of a vote on this Agreement and the Merger, or
(ii) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders' Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting. The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders'
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies
solicited by the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting
are solicited, in compliance with Delaware Law, and the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market,
Inc. and all other applicable legal requirements. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company's obligation to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with
this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the
     --------------
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or by any withholding, withdrawal,
amendment, modification or change of the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company with respect to this Agreement and/or the Merger.

          (b)  Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withheld,
withdrawn, amended, modified or changed its recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger in compliance with Section 5.2(c) hereof: (i) the Board of Directors
of the Company shall unanimously recommend that the Company's stockholders vote
in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include
a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has
unanimously recommended that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of and
adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, change or
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change, in each case
in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of and
adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger. For all purposes of and
under this Agreement, the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the Company shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent
if such recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof shall no longer be unanimous.

          (c)  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending, modifying or changing its
unanimous recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and approval of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to
the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
representatives shall have violated the terms of

                                     -38-
<PAGE>

Section 5.5 hereof and the Company is not then in material breach of this
-----------
Agreement, and (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably concludes
in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of
such Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment, modification or
changing of such recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors
of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under Delaware Law with respect to such Superior Offer; provided,
however, that prior to publicly withholding, withdrawing, amending, modifying or
changing its recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger, the Company shall have given Parent at
least three (3) business days prior written notice (or such lesser prior notice
as provided to the members of Company's Board of Directors) thereof and the
opportunity to meet with the Company and its counsel. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.2 shall limit the Company's obligation to hold and convene the Company
-----------
Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of whether the unanimous recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have been withheld, withdrawn, amended,
modified or changed pursuant hereto). As used in this Agreement, the term
"Superior Offer" shall mean any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
 --------------
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.5(b) hereof) for all of the outstanding shares
                        --------------
of Company Common Stock on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to the Company's
stockholders than the terms of the Merger; provided, however, that any such
offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" pursuant hereto if any
financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is
both not committed and not likely, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company, to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

     5.3  Confidentiality.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the Company and
          ---------------
Parent have previously executed a Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated as of
September 8, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality
                        -------------------------
Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

     5.4  Access to Information.  During the period commencing with the
          ---------------------
execution and delivery of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Effective Time, the
Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
properties, books, records and personnel of the Company to obtain all
information concerning the business of the Company, including, without
limitation, the status of the Company's product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel, as Parent may reasonably request. No
information or knowledge obtained by Parent during the course of any
investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect, or be deemed
                                         -----------
to modify in any respect any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger contained
herein.

first sentence of this Section 5.5(a)) shall prohibit the Company from
furnishing information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, or
entering into a confidentiality agreement with, or entering into or conducting

          (b)  For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term

          (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set
forth in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Company's rights
under Section 5.2 and Section 5.5 hereof), each of the parties hereto shall use
      -----------     -----------
its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, using reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i)
the taking of all reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent
set forth in Article VI hereof to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all
             ----------
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and

reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties which may be
required or desirable as a result of, or in connection with, the transactions

similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any
divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of
any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material

                                     -42-

aware that any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate, or that the Company has failed to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that
the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) hereof would not be
                            --------------    --------------

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company, or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          (c)  Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or that Parent or Merger Sub has
failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in
each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section
                                                 --------------    -------

organizational documents of each subsidiary of the Company as in effect on the

          -------------------------------------------
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter
(i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of
this Agreement; and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other person any
rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in Section 5.11
                                                                 ------------
hereof.

     8.6  Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
          ------------
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent

Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the

                                     -55-

application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

     8.7  Other Remedies; Specific Performance.  Except as otherwise provided
          ------------------------------------
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

     8.8  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
          -------------
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

     8.9  Rules of Construction.  The parties hereto agree that they have been
          ---------------------
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

     8.10 Assignment.  No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
          ----------
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

     8.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB
          --------------------
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, THE COMPANY OR MERGER SUB
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
