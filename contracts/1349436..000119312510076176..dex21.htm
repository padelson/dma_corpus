-v- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 3,
2010, among SANDRIDGE ENERGY, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), STEEL SUBSIDIARY CORPORATION, a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and ARENA RESOURCES, INC., a Nevada 
_corporation (the " _Company_ ")._

_I NTRODUCTION_

The respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have (i) approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) approved this Agreement.

As a result of the Merger, and in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes
(the " _NRS_ "), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") (other than
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

The parties to this Agreement intend that the Merger qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), for Federal income tax purposes,
and that this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization.

In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants contained in
this Agreement and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, in accordance with this
Agreement and the NRS, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving entity; provided that if the opinions described in
Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c) hereof cannot be delivered unless at the Effective
Time the Company is instead merged with and into Merger Sub with the separate
existence of the Company ceasing and Merger Sub continuing as the
surviving entity, then at the Effective Time, in accordance with this
Agreement and the NRS, the Company shall be merged with and into the Merger
Sub, the separate existence of the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving entity. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the
entity surviving the Merger after the Effective Time is referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ " and (ii) the Company and Merger Sub are collectively
referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_."

SECTION 1.2. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 92A.250 of the NRS.



 

-1- SECTION 1.3. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. (EDT) on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the next business day after satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 7 (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied
or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived on the Closing Date), at
the offices of Covington and Burling LLP, The New York Times Building, 620
Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10018, unless another time, date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date upon which the Closing
occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "). 

SECTION 1.4. _Consummation of the Merger_. As soon as practicable after the
Closing, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada articles of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the NRS and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
NRS. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger
are duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such later time as Parent
and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the time
and date the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ " and
_"Effective Date_ ," respectively).

 

SECTION 1.5. _Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers_. The articles
of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the NRS.
The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein and under the NRS. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
articles of incorporation and bylaws and the NRS. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation and shall serve until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations articles of
incorporation and bylaws and the NRS.

ARTICLE 2

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE EQUITY OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.1. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, each
share of capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter represent one
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



 

-2- SECTION 2.2. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.2(b)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive (i) 4.7771 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("
_Parent Common Stock_ ") plus (ii) $2.50 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Merger
Consideration_ " means the right to receive the consideration described in the
immediately preceding sentence pursuant to the Merger with respect to each
share of Company Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend
thereon shall have been declared with a record date within such period, the
Exchange Ratio, the Conversion Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration
shall be correspondingly adjusted.

SECTION 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall
provide that Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective
Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, through the Exchange Agent, (i)
cash sufficient to make the payments pursuant to Section 2.2 and (ii)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 2.2 (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Sock with a
record date after the Effective Time and any cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ ") in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock. With respect to any cash deposited by Parent with the Exchange Agent
as described in 



 

-3-  the immediately preceding sentence, the Exchange Agent shall invest such
cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that during the
first six months after the Effective Time such investments shall consist
solely of (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of inbound deposits with commercial banks having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $500 million, (iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1
or A-1 or better by Standard and Poors or Moodys or (iv) institutional cash
management funds. From time to time as necessary, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares as
contemplated by Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions to
which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor (i) the cash which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2, (ii) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.2, (iii) certain dividends or other distributions in accordance
with Section 2.3(c) and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued and paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance or payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in
accordance with this Section 2.3 the Merger Consideration which the applicable
holder of shares of Company Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this Article 2.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time 



 

-4-  shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(e), in each case until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration issued or paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 (including any cash paid
pursuant to this Article 2) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as
otherwise provided by law.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall
relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent.

(ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall either (A) pay
to each former holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest to which
such former holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled
by (y) the average of the last reported sale prices for a share of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the five trading days
prior to the Closing Date or (B) instruct the Exchange Agent to follow the
procedures set forth in Section 2.3(e)(iii). 

(iii) If Parent shall have instructed the Exchange Agent to follow the
procedures in this Section 2.3(e)(iii): 

(A) The Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the aggregate number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that would be distributed to holders of the
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1 if no effect were given to Section
2.3(e)(i) over (y) the aggregate number 



 

-5-  of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of the
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1, taking into account the effect of
Section 2.3(e)(i) (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ ").

(B) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE, in the manner
set forth below.

(C) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-
of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the
Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares.
Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of the Certificates (or paid to Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(f)), the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of the
Certificates (the " _Common Stock Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Stock Trust to which each holder of a
Certificate shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Stock Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest in the
Parent Common Stock to which such holder of a Certificate is entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests in
the Parent Common Stock to which all holders of the Certificates are entitled.
Parent shall comply with the provisions of Rule 236(c) under the Securities
Act.

(D) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Certificates in lieu of any fractional share
interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without
interest, to such holders of Certificates that have surrendered their
Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.3.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration, any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any cash from the Exchange
Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental authority), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, 



 

-6-  stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto
and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof and any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case pursuant to this
Agreement.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. The Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Parent and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent.

SECTION 2.4.  _Company Options; Restricted Stock_. (a) Parent shall not
assume any Options in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Not later than 30 days prior to the scheduled or anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall send a notice to all holders of Options, which notice shall
notify such holders that (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not be
assuming any Options following the Effective Time or substituting new options
therefore, and (ii) all unvested Options shall become vested and fully
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (and such Options shall
be so vested and exercisable). Any Options that are In-the-Money as of the
Effective Time and that are not exercised prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed automatically exercised by the holder thereof and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (i) the
Conversion Ratio multiplied by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Stock issuable upon
the exercise of the applicable Options multiplied by (2) the excess of (A)
the Company Closing Price over (B) the exercise price per share of the
applicable Options, by (y) the Company Closing Price. Any Options that are
not In-The-Money as of the Effective Time will be canceled. Holders of
Options that become fully vested only as of and effectively immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be permitted to exercise such fully vested Options
effective as of and contingent upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _In-the-Money_ "
means, with respect to an Option, the excess of (1) the Company Closing Price
over (2) the exercise price per share of the applicable Options, being a
positive number; (ii) " _Company Closing Price_ " means the last reported sale
price of the Company Common Stock on the NYSE on the Closing Date; (iii) "
_Parent Closing Price_ " means the last reported sale price of the Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE on the Closing Date; and (iv) " _Conversion Ratio_ "
means the sum of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the quotient obtained by
dividing (1) the Per Share Cash Consideration by (2) the Parent Closing Price.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions necessary
to effect the transactions anticipated by Section 2.4(a) under the Stock Plans
and any Option 



 

-7-  agreement thereunder and any other plan or arrangement of the Company
(whether written or oral, formal or informal). As soon as practicable
following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to each holder of an Option any certifications, notices or other
communications required by the terms of such Option or any agreement entered
into with respect thereto to be delivered to such holder prior to the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) At the Effective Time, each of the then outstanding awards of Restricted
Stock shall be (i) assumed by Parent, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Stock Plan and award agreement by which it is evidenced, except as
provided in the immediately succeeding sentence or in the Company Disclosure
Letter and except that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Board
of Directors or Compensation Committee, as the case may be, shall be
substituted for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Boards of Directors and committees thereof administering any such Stock Plan,
and (ii) converted into an award of a number of shares of restricted Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Conversion Ratio multiplied by
(B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such award. With
respect to any employee of the Company whose primary work location is at the
Tulsa office, each such award of restricted Parent Common Stock will vest upon
the earliest to occur of the following: (x) the vesting of such award
pursuant to the terms of the applicable original award agreement, (y) the end
of the Transition Period (as such term is defined in the Severance Plan which
is described in Section 3.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter) with
respect to the applicable employee and (z) the Termination Date (as such term
is defined in the Severance Plan) with respect to the applicable employee.
With respect to any other employee of the Company, each such award of
restricted Parent Common Stock will vest pursuant to the terms of the
applicable original award agreement. If the calculation of the number of
Parent Common Stock as described above results in the assumption of an award
of Restricted Stock that would include a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock, then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such award
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to effect the provisions of this Section 2.4(c).

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the shares of Restricted Stock to be assumed under paragraph (c)
above to be registered on Form S-8, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such assumed Restricted Stock remain outstanding. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each holder of an assumed Restricted Stock an appropriate notice setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to such Restricted Stock.

(e) The Company and Parent shall take all commercially reasonable actions
which are necessary in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.4 as of the Effective Time.



 

-8- SECTION 2.5. _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the
Merger under the NRS as promptly as commercially practicable. If at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name of each Constituent Corporations or otherwise to take, and shall
take, all such lawful and necessary action.

Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all Company Employee Benefit Plans.
There are no Company Employee Benefit Plans established, maintained, adopted,

federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code. All assets of any
Company Employee Benefit Plan consist of cash, actively traded securities or

Company Employee Benefit Plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (x) no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to
any Company Employee 



 

-15-  Benefit Plan and (y) no fiduciary has any liability for breach of fiduciary
duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of assets of any Company Employee Benefit Plan.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliates has ever established,

termination of the individuals employment, except to the extent required by
the COBRA provisions in ERISA and the Code or any similar provisions of state
law.

(j) Except as described in Section 3.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in connection with termination of employment, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, independent contractor, director, or officer of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to severance pay, any change in
control payment or any other material payment, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, change the

such employee, independent contractor, director, or officer or (iii) entitle
any such employee, independent contractor, director or officer to any gross-up

action that would result in its incurring any obligation for any payments or
benefits described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 3.10(j)
(without regard to whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are

commitment, or proposal, whether legally binding or not, nor has any of them
made a commitment to employees, officers, directors, consultants or
independent contractors to create any additional Company Employee Benefit Plan
or modify, change or terminate any existing Company Employee Benefit Plan,
and no such plan, commitment or proposal is under serious consideration. No
events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in the cost of
providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a material change in the
cost of providing for other liabilities of such plan.

SECTION 3.11. _Board Recommendation; Company Action; Requisite Vote of the
Company s Stockholders_.

(a) The Board of Directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly adopted by
the requisite vote of the directors present at a meeting of such board duly
called and held on April 2, 2010 and not subsequently rescinded or modified
in any way, (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated hereby
are advisable and in the best interests of the Company, (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted for
consideration by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve this
Agreement (provided that any change in or modification or rescission of such
recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance
with Section 6.10(a) shall not be a breach of the representation in this
clause (iv)). The Company hereby confirms that (A) the Company has taken all
necessary action to exempt Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby from any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other antitakeover statute or
similar statute or regulation under the NRS, including Sections 78.3781
through 78.3793 of the NRS, and (B) to the knowledge of the Company, no other
"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other antitakeover
statute or similar statute or regulation, applies or purports to apply
to this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company has received from the
Companys Fairness Opinion Provider an opinion, a written copy of which will
be provided to Parent, solely for informational purposes promptly after
receipt thereof by the Company, to the effect that, as of the date of the
opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of the Company Common Stock (subject to assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein). The Company has been authorized by the
Companys Fairness Opinion Provider to include such opinion in its entirety in
the Joint Proxy Statement included in the Form S-4, so long as such inclusion
is in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Companys Fairness
Opinion Provider and its counsel.

(b) The affirmative vote of stockholders of the Company required for adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger is and will be no greater than a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Required Company Stockholder Vote_ ").



 

-17- SECTION 3.12. _Taxes_.

(a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed all
material federal, state, local, and other Tax Returns required to be filed by
it in the manner prescribed by applicable law and all such Tax Returns are
true, complete and correct in all material respects. All Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Returns have been paid in full and the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has made adequate provision (or adequate provision has been made
on its behalf) for all accrued Taxes not yet due. The accruals and reserves
for Taxes reflected in the Companys Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009 are adequate to cover all Taxes accruing through such date.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have withheld and paid over all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid over, and complied in
all material respects with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including the maintenance of required records with respect
thereto, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
independent contractor or other third party. There are no material Liens on
any of the assets, rights or properties of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to Taxes, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable or for Taxes that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is contesting in
good faith through appropriate proceedings. Except as has not, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all hedging
transactions entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
have been properly identified for federal income tax purposes.

(b) Except as identified in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
as of the date of this Agreement, no federal, state, local or foreign audits
or other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently pending
with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received a
written notice of any material pending or proposed claims, audits or
proceedings with respect to Taxes. No material deficiencies have been asserted
in writing against the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of
examinations by any state, local, federal or foreign taxing authority and no
material issue has been raised by any examination conducted by any state,
local, federal or foreign taxing authority that, by application of the same
principles, might result in a proposed deficiency for any other period not so
examined which deficiency (or deficiencies), in either case, is not (or are
not) adequately reserved for in the most recent Company Financial Statements.
Each material deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating to
Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any taxing authority has
been paid or is being contested in good faith and in accordance with law and
is adequately reserved for on the balance sheets contained in the Company
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. No claim is pending and no claim
has ever been made that has not been resolved by an authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries does not
file Tax Returns that the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, is or may be subject to Tax in that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any private letter ruling of
the Internal Revenue Service or comparable rulings of other tax authorities
that will be binding on the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
any period following the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has granted any power of attorney which is currently in force with
respect to any income, franchise or similar Taxes or any income, franchise or
similar Tax Returns.



 

-18- (c) Except as identified in Section 3.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has requested any extension of
time within which to file any material Tax Return which Tax Return has not yet
been filed. There are no agreements, waivers of statutes of limitations, or
other arrangements providing for extensions of time in respect of the
assessment or collection of any unpaid Taxes against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have disclosed on
their federal income tax returns all positions taken therein that could, if
not so disclosed, give rise to a substantial understatement penalty within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has been a party to a "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.6011-4(b).

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any
taxing authority).

 

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement,
contract or arrangement that, individually or collectively, would give rise to
the payment of any amount (whether in cash or property, including shares of
capital stock) that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section
280G of the Code or would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of
the Code, or, to the knowledge of the Company, that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1), 162(m) or 162(n) of the Code. 

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning

Companys estimate of Companys and Company Subsidiaries oil and gas
reserves as of December 31, 2009 (the " _Company Reserve Report_ "). Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data on
which the Company Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil
and gas reserves set forth in the Company Reserve Report was accurate. The
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves used by the Company in connection
with the preparation of the Company Reserve Report are in accordance with
definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC.

SECTION 3.19. _Hedging_. The Company SEC Reports accurately summarize the

SECTION 3.20. _Properties_.

(a) All major items of operating equipment owned or leased by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) are, in the aggregate, in a state of

applicable contracts, including sales contracts.

(b) Except for goods and other property sold, used or otherwise disposed of
since December 31, 2009 in the ordinary course of business, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all oil and gas
leases and other properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in
the Company Reserve Reports as attributable to interests owned by the Company

properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement as owned by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, except: (i) Liens
associated with obligations reflected in the Company Reserve Report or the
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) Liens for
current taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) such imperfections of title,
easements, Liens, government or tribal approvals or other matters and failures
of title as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) Liens identified
in Section 3.20(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _good and defensible title_ " means title that is free from
reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the business of
purchasing and owning, developing, and operating producing oil and gas
properties in the geographical areas in which they are located,
with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing
to accept the same acting reasonably.

(c) (i) The leases and other agreements pursuant to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating
rights affecting any real or personal property given material value in the
Company Reserve Report are in good standing, valid and effective, (ii)

agreement in breach or default thereunder, and (iii) the rentals due by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases
have been properly paid, except in each case as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 3.21. _Natural Gas Act_. Any gas gathering system constituting a part
of the properties of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has as its
primary function the provision of natural gas gathering services, as the term
"gathering" is interpreted under Section 1(b) of the NGA; none of the
properties have been or are certificated by the FERC under Section 7(c) of
the NGA or to the knowledge of the Company are now subject to FERC
jurisdiction under the NGA; and none of the properties have been or are
providing service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGA. 

SECTION 3.22. _Insurance_. Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a true and complete list of all insurance policies held by either
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage adequate and customary in the
industry for the operation of their respective businesses (taking into
account the cost and availability of such insurance). All such insurance
policies are in full force and effect and all related premiums have been paid
to date.

SECTION 3.23. _Certain Contracts and Arrangements_. Neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any agreement or
other arrangement that limits or otherwise restricts the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any successor thereto, or that would, after the Effective
Time, to the knowledge of the Company, materially limit or restrict Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries or any successor
thereto, from engaging or competing in the oil and gas exploration and
production business in any significant geographic area, except for joint
ventures, area of mutual interest agreements entered into in connection with
prospect reviews and similar arrangements entered into in the ordinary course
of business. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, each contract filed or incorporated by reference as
an exhibit to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2009 is valid, binding, in full force and effect and enforceable

default under any such contract nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is any
other party to any such contract in breach or default thereunder.

SECTION 4.5. _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_. (a) Since January 1,
2007, Parent has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules,
registration statements, definitive proxy statements and other documents
(collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the " _Parent SEC Reports_
") required to be filed by Parent with the SEC. As of their respective dates,
and giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, the Parent SEC Reports complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and none of the Parent SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the Parent Subsidiaries is required to file any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15 of
the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding comments from the Staff of the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

Parent Financial Statements, neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), other than any liabilities incurred since December
31, 2009 which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



 

-27- (c) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on
Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Parent SEC

financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the

complete and correct. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to Parent required to be disclosed
in Parents Exchange Act Reports, including its consolidated Parent
Subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared; and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Parents periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act.

covered by insurance) affecting the business or assets owned or operated by
the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; or

(c) any event, condition, action or occurrence that, if taken during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would
constitute a breach of Section 5.2.

SECTION 4.7. _Litigation_. There are no suits, actions or legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings or
governmental investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, to which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no judgments,
decrees, injunctions, rules, awards or orders of any governmental or
regulatory entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate, have had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.8. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at
any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order 



 

-28-  to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or Parents

Securities Inc. (the " _Parent Financial Advisor_ "), no agent, broker, Person
or firm acting on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or under
Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys authority is or will be entitled to any

will not, either alone or in connection with termination of employment, (i)
entitle any current or former employee, independent contractor, director, or
officer of the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries to severance pay, any change
in control payment or any other material payment, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
change the form or method of payment, or increase the amount of compensation
due, any such employee, independent contractor, director, or officer or (iii)
entitle any such employee, independent contractor, director or officer to any

any action that would result in its incurring any obligation for any payments
or benefits described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section

commitment, or proposal, whether legally binding or not, nor has any of them
made a commitment to employees, officers, directors, consultants or
independent contractors to create any additional Parent Employee Benefit Plan
or modify, change or terminate any existing Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and
no such plan, commitment or proposal is under serious consideration. No
events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect to any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in the cost of
providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a material change in the
cost of providing for other liabilities of such plan.

SECTION 4.11. _Board Recommendation; Parent Action_. The Board of Directors of
Parent has, by resolutions duly adopted by the requisite vote of the
directors present at a meeting of such board duly called and held on April 3,

Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment, (ii) directed the Share Issuance
and the Parent Charter Amendment be submitted for consideration by the
stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and (iii)

the Parent Financial Advisor an opinion, a written copy of which will be
provided to the Company, solely for informational purposes promptly after
receipt thereof by Parent, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion,
the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent.
Parent has been authorized by the Parent Financial Advisor to include such
opinion in its entirety in the Joint Proxy Statement included in the Form S-4
so long as such inclusion is in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Parent Financial Advisor and its counsel.

(b) The Required Parent Stockholder Vote is the only vote of the holders of
the Parents capital stock required in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger, the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment.

SECTION 4.12. _Taxes_ Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has timely
filed all material federal, state, local, and other Tax Returns required to
be filed by it in the manner prescribed by applicable law and all such Tax
Returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects. All Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns have been paid in full and Parent and
each Parent Subsidiary has made adequate provision (or adequate provision has
been made on its behalf) for all accrued Taxes not yet due. The accruals and
reserves for Taxes reflected in the Parents Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2009 are adequate to cover all Taxes accruing through such
date. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have withheld and paid over all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid over, and complied in
all material respects with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including the maintenance of required records with respect
thereto, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
independent contractor or other third party. There are no material Liens on
any of the assets, rights or properties of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
with respect to Taxes, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or
for Taxes that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is contesting in good faith
through appropriate proceedings. Except as has not, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all hedging
transactions entered into by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries have
been properly identified for federal income tax purposes.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, no federal, state, local or foreign
audits or other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently
pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, and neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received a
written notice of any material pending or proposed claims, audits or
proceedings with respect to Taxes. No material deficiencies have been asserted
in writing against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as a result of examinations
by any state, local, federal or foreign taxing authority and no material
issue has been raised by any examination conducted by any state, local,
federal or foreign taxing authority that, by application of the same
principles, might result in a proposed deficiency for any other period not so
examined which deficiency ( or deficiencies), in either case, is not (or are
not) adequately reserved for in the most recent Parent Financial Statements.
Each material deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating to
Taxes of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by any taxing authority has 



 

-32-  been paid or is being contested in good faith and in accordance with law and
is adequately reserved for on the balance sheets contained in the Parent
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. No claim is pending and no
claim has ever been made that has not been resolved by an authority in a
jurisdiction where the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries does not file
Tax Returns that the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as the case may be, is
or may be subject to Tax in that jurisdiction. Neither the Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary is subject to any private letter ruling of the Internal
Revenue Service or comparable rulings of other tax authorities that will be
binding on the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with respect to any period
following the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
granted any power of attorney which is currently in force with respect to any
income, franchise or similar Taxes or any income, franchise or similar Tax
Returns.

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has requested any extension
of time within which to file any material Tax Return which Tax Return has not
yet been filed. There are no agreements, waivers of statutes of limitations,
or other arrangements providing for extensions of time in respect of the
assessment or collection of any unpaid Taxes against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have disclosed on their federal
income tax returns all positions taken therein that could, if not so
disclosed, give rise to a substantial understatement penalty within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has been a party to a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
Sec. 1.6011-4(b).

(c) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any Tax sharing
agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement, arrangement or
practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing agreement,
closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any taxing
authority).

(d) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any agreement,
contract or arrangement that, individually or collectively, would give rise to
the payment of any amount (whether in cash or property, including shares of
capital stock) that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section
280G of the Code or would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of
the Code, or, to the knowledge of Parent, that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1), 162(m) or 162(n) of the Code.

(e) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355 (a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying
for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement.

filing. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4; without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will furnish to each other the

Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of

documents 



 

-43-  would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

Stockholders Meeting unless the recommendation of the Board described in this
Section 6.1(b) has been made and remains in effect). Once the Company
Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (other than (i)

amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (iii) in the event
the Board of Directors of the Company withdraws, modifies or changes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement its recommendation that
this Agreement and the Merger are in the best interests of the Company;

Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and recommend that this Agreement be approved by the stockholders of
the Company and include in the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement a copy
of such recommendations; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company

of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to whom
the Company has provided Parent with the following information: name, title,
date of hire (and rehire, if applicable), salary or rate of pay, bonus
opportunities and a schedule of outstanding equity grants (" _Acquired
Employees_ ").

(a) _Employment_. All Acquired Employees shall be employed solely on an "at
will" basis, except to the extent required by the provisions of written
employment contracts or as required by applicable law. An Acquired Employee
whose employment is terminated ceases immediately to be an "Acquired
Employee" for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) _Benefit Plans_. The Surviving Corporation shall assume the Company
Employee Benefit Plans (including the Severance Plan and remaining obligations
related to the other Employee Retention and Severance Payments as set forth on
Section 3.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter) as of the Effective Time
and operate such plans in accordance 



 

-45-  with their respective terms, and the Company shall take any steps necessary
to permit such assumption, except that, before the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as are necessary to terminate the Companys tax-
qualified retirement plans. Acquired Employees shall continue after the
Effective Time to participate in such assumed Plans. At such time as
determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (but in no event later than
December 31, 2010), Acquired Employees shall participate in Parents
compensation, severance, bonus, stock option and other incentive plans for
which they are eligible pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans, or
in similar plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation, in each case
consistent with the participation offered to Parents employees holding
similar positions. Each such plan shall grant credit to each Acquired Employee
for all service prior to the Effective Time with the Company (including any
predecessors) for vesting and eligibility purposes, but not for benefit
accrual in any plan or for any purpose in the Companys nonqualified deferred
compensation plans. No Acquired Employee shall be simultaneously covered
under similar employee benefit plans of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall restrict in
any manner the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend
or terminate any assumed Company Employee Benefit Plan or to modify any
compensation arrangement of any Acquired Employee for any reason at any time
(in each case subject to the provisions of any written employment contracts).

(c) _Group Health Plans_. During the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs, any group health plan established or maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall, with respect to any eligible Acquired Employee
or, as applicable, a family member of an eligible Acquired Employee, (i) waive
any waiting period, (ii) waive any exclusion or limitation for preexisting
conditions which were covered under any group health plan maintained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, (iii) grant credit (for purposes of
annual deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket limits) for any covered
claims incurred or payments made prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) accept
rollovers of the health flexible spending account and dependent care accounts
of eligible Acquired Employees.

(d) _Employee Communications_. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
in the distribution or other dissemination of communications before the
Effective Time to individuals who are employees of the Company. Any
communication that any party to this Agreement intends to distribute to such
individuals relating to their employment following the date of this
Agreement shall be subject to the approval of the other parties to this
Agreement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
parties to this Agreement shall also cooperate in issuing any notice that
might be required under the WARN Act or any similar state law so as to
provide such notice in full compliance with the WARN Act or any similar state
law.

or required by the terms of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, franchise, permit, concession, contract, lease or
other instrument to which the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, franchise, permit, concession, contract, lease or other
instrument shall be amended or modified to increase in any material respect
the amount payable thereunder or to be otherwise more burdensome, or less
favorable, in each case in any material respect, to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise in order to obtain any
permit, consent, approval or authorization without first obtaining the written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Company shall have the right to review and approve in advance
all characterizations of the information relating to the Company; Parent shall
have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the

provided herein, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and

Parent and the Company shall execute the officers certificates substantially
in the form attached as Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto, as of the date the Form
S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and as of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of Parent or the Company to certify as to any
matter in such officer certificate because of an event, or change in facts or
law, in any such case outside of such partys control, shall not constitute a
breach of this covenant.

SECTION 6.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company agrees to give
prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and to use commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (i) the occurrence or failure to occur,
or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any event
