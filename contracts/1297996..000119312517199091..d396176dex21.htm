Partnership Agreement_ "), until thereafter amended in accordance with

agreement and (ii) the Company Operating Partnership Agreement, as in effect
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, shall be amended
and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ (the " _Surviving Partnership Agreement_ "), until thereafter

Section 1.6 _Manager, General Partner and Officers_ _of the_
_Surviving Entit_ _ies_.

(a) The Board of Directors of DLR as of the Company Merger Effective Time
shall be comprised of (i) the members of the Board of Directors of DLR as of
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and (ii) two (2)

(b) Merger Sub GP shall be and become the general partner of the Surviving

officers of OP Merger Sub immediately prior to the Partnership Merger

as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

Section 1.7 _Tax Consequences_. The Parties intend that, for United States
federal income tax purposes (and, where applicable, state and local income
tax purposes), (i) the Company Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement shall be, and is
hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 354 and
361 of the Code, and (ii) the Partnership Merger shall qualify as and
constitute an "assets-over" form of merger governed by Treasury Regulations
Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) pursuant to which the Company Operating Partnership
contributes all of its assets and liabilities to DLR OP in exchange for the OP
Merger Consideration and the Preferred OP Merger Consideration in
a transaction qualifying under Section 721(a) of the Code and immediately
thereafter, the Company Operating Partnership distributes such OP Merger
Consideration and Preferred OP Merger Consideration to the holders of the
Company Partnership Units and the Company Series C Preferred Partnership
Units, respectively, with DLR OP being a continuation of DLR OP pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
receipt by the holders of Company Partnership Units of shares of DLR Common
Stock or cash pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a sale by such
holders of their Company Partnership Units and a purchase by DLR OP of such
Company Partnership Units for United States federal income tax purposes (the
" _Sale Treatment_ "), and the Company Operating Partnerships transfer of its
assets and liabilities to DLR OP, to the extent attributable to the Sale

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of the
Company or of REIT Merger Sub:

(i) _Treatment of_ _Company Capital Stock_.

 

A. _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
(other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_
) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.545 (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of DLR Common
Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Merger Consideration payable to
each holder of Company Shares will be aggregated and rounded down to the
nearest whole share and each such holder shall be entitled to receive such
number of whole shares of DLR Common Stock with any fractional shares being
treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. From and after the Company
Merger Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a Company Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such Company Share in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, including the
right to receive, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of DLR Common Stock, if any, into which such shares of Company Common
Stock have been converted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ (the "
_Common Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_.

B. _Treatment of Company Series C Preferred Stock_. Each share of
Company Series C Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of DLR
Series C Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred Merger Consideration_ ") and shall
have the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and
conditions of redemption and other rights and restrictions as set forth in the
Amended DLR Charter.

 



6 (ii) _Treatment of REIT Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of REIT
Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time shall survive the Company Merger and continue to
represent a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of REIT Merger
Sub Common Stock.

 

(b) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of
the Company Operating Partnership or DLR OP:

(i) _Treatment of Partnership Units_. (A) Each Company Partnership Unit
(other than a Company Series C Preferred Partnership Unit which shall be
converted pursuant to clause (B) hereof) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive a fraction of a validly issued DLR OP Common Unit (referred
to herein as the " _New DLR OP Units_ " or the " _OP Merger Consideration_ ")
equal to (x) the Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_  (y) one, and (B) each
Company Series C Preferred Partnership Unit shall be converted into one
validly issued DLR OP Series C Preferred Partnership Unit (referred to herein
as the " _New DLR OP Preferred OP Units_ " or the " _Preferred OP Merger
Consideration_ "); provided that in lieu of receiving New DLR OP Units in the
Partnership Merger, each limited partner (excluding the Company) of the
Company Operating Partnership (each a " _Minority Limited Partner_ ") shall
have the right to elect to receive for each Company Partnership Unit held by
such Minority Limited Partner immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time a number of shares of DLR Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio, and any Minority Limited Partner so electing shall be deemed to have
elected to redeem its Company Partnership Units pursuant to Section 8.6 of the
Company Operating Partnership Agreement, effective immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time and shall be treated as having received
in exchange for its Company Partnership Units an equal number of shares of
Company Common Stock as of such time, without any further action being
required by such Minority Limited Partner. For the avoidance of doubt, such
shares of Company Common Stock deemed to be issued upon any such redemption
shall be subject to the same exchange procedures as all other shares of
Company Common Stock and the DLR Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor
shall be "Merger Consideration" for all purposes herein. No fractional New DLR
OP Units or fractional shares of DLR Common Stock will be issued in the
Partnership Merger. The New DLR OP Units or shares of DLR Common Stock (as
applicable) issuable to each holder of Company Partnership Units shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole unit or share (as applicable) and each such
holder shall be entitled receive such number of whole New DLR OP Units or
shares of DLR Common Stock (as applicable) with any fractional units or
shares being treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (the " _OP
Fractional Unit Consideration_ " and, together with the Common Fractional
Share Consideration, the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "). Each holder
of New DLR OP Units and/or New DLR OP Preferred OP Units shall be admitted as
a limited partner of DLR OP in accordance with the terms of the Post-Effective
Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement following the Partnership Merger
Effective Time. Section 5.4 of the Post-Effective Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement, which provides for a pro rata reduction in the
distributions set forth in Section 5.1 of the Post-Effective Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement with respect to the period during which the
Closing Date occurs, shall not apply to the New DLR OP Units issued in
connection with the Partnership Merger.

 



7 (ii) _Treatment of OP Merger Sub Ownership Interests_. (A) The ownership
interests in OP Merger Sub that are held by Merger Sub GP immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into
the general partner interest in the Surviving Partnership and Merger Sub GP
shall be admitted as the general partner of the Surviving Partnership and (B)
the ownership interests in OP Merger Sub that are held by DLR OP immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and
converted into the limited partner interest in the Surviving Partnership and
DLR OP shall be admitted as a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership.

(c)  _Adjustment to_ _Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration, the OP
Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio and other dependent items shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock, Company Partnership Units,
DLR Common Stock or DLR Partnership Units, as applicable), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Partnership Units, DLR Common Stock or DLR Partnership Units
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time and Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, so as to provide
the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units with the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event and
as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, the OP Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio or other dependent
items.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of_ _Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, DLR shall
designate American Stock Transfer and Trust Company to act as the exchange
agent in connection with the Mergers (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, DLR shall deposit, or cause DLR OP to deposit,
with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of DLR Common Stock and DLR Series C
Preferred Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration) and aggregate Preferred Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Fractional
Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions under _Section
2.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of DLR Common Stock and
DLR Series C Preferred Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each
case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Series C Preferred Stock and DLR (solely to the extent any amounts in
the Exchange Fund are in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(i)_ ). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the
aggregate Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions under _Section 2.2(f)_ , DLR shall, or shall cause DLR OP to,
promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which
is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. DLR
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the

 



8  Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including
payment of the Fractional Share Consideration and Preferred Merger
Consideration and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C Preferred Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that
is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed
by DLR; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that any investment of such cash shall
in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
DLR on the earlier of (i) one (1) year after the Company Merger Effective
Time or (ii) the full payment of the Exchange Fund; _provided_ , that any
amounts in the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable under _Section
2.1(a)(i)_ shall be promptly paid to DLR.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Company Merger Effective
Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days after the Company
Merger Effective Time), DLR shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares or shares of Company
Series C Preferred Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) non-certificated
Company Shares or shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and, in each case, whose Company Shares
or shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, were converted
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as DLR may
reasonably specify and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger
Consideration, as applicable, including any amount payable in respect of the
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of DLR Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by DLR, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration (as applicable) for
each share of Company Common Stock or Company Series C Preferred Stock (as
applicable) formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (rounded down to the nearest
whole share, if applicable), any Fractional Share Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the

 



9  provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, and any amounts that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of
DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.2(f)_ for each Company Share or share of Company Series C Preferred
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be
mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to
occur of (i) the Company Merger Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agents
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the
Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (i) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of DLR that such Tax either has
been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __
_ 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Company Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration (as
applicable), including any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and any dividends or
other distributions on shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C Preferred
Stock in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_, without interest thereon.
Shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C Preferred Stock deliverable
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_ in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Series C Preferred Stock, respectively, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Company Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Company Shares or Company Series C Preferred Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the holders of
Company Shares and shares of Company Series C Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares or shares of Company Series C
Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the Company Merger Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to DLR for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the Company Merger Effective Time, DLR shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which

 



10  disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange Agents routine
administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to DLR and DLR OP
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration or
Preferred Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of
the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and
any dividends or other distributions on shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR
Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f),_ payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ , without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of DLR, DLR OP, the Surviving Entity, the
Surviving Partnership, Merger Sub GP or the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration or other amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in a form
reasonably satisfactory to DLR and the Exchange Agent, and if required by DLR
or the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder thereof of a bond in the
amount and the form reasonably required by DLR or the Exchange Agent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against DLR with respect to
such Certificates, the applicable Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
hereof, including any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and any dividends or
other distributions on shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C Preferred
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_.

(f) _Dividends with Respect to DLR Capital Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C
Preferred Stock with a record date after the Company Merger Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share with respect to the shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR Series C
Preferred Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions paid with respect to such shares of DLR Common Stock or DLR
Series C Preferred Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement shall be paid by DLR to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in
the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with
this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Company Merger
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of DLR Common
Stock or DLR Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Company Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of DLR
Common Stock or DLR Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable.

 



11 (g) _Payment of Dividends with Respect to Company Series C Preferred Stock_.
Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for further payment to
holders prior to such time of the Company Series C Preferred Stock an amount
in cash equal to the aggregate of any accrued but unpaid dividend or
distribution in respect of the Company Series C Preferred Stock to, but not
including, the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 5.1(c)_ , including
any Company Permitted Dividend with respect to the Company Series C Preferred
Stock, that shall not then have been paid to the holders of Company Series C
Preferred Stock.

Section 2.3  _Dissenter_ __ _s Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights

Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plans (each, a " _Restricted
Company Share_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Company

and each such Restricted Company Share shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, the Merger

2.2_, including any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share

rounded down to the nearest whole share; and (y) with an exercise price per
share of DLR Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent
(each such Company Option so converted and assumed, an " _Assumed Option_ ").
Each Assumed Option shall be subject to substantially the same vesting,

Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner

Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(j) No Company Benefit Plan, and neither the Company, nor any Company
Subsidiary nor any Company Benefit Plan fiduciary with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan, in any case, is the subject of an audit or investigation by the
IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any
other Governmental Entity, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or,
to the Companys knowledge, threatened.

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will (i) entitle any current
or former Service Provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
payment or benefit; (ii) increase the amount of compensation or benefits due
to any such Service Provider; or (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time
of payment of any compensation, equity award or other benefit to any such

Benefit Plan, (iv) there are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge,
threatened investigations by any Governmental Entity, Legal Proceedings or

hereby, either alone or in combination with another event (whether contingent
or otherwise) will create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to
such Foreign Company Benefit Plan. No Foreign Company Benefit Plan has any
unfunded or underfunded liabilities not accurately accrued in accordance with
GAAP.

Company Subsidiaries.

(b) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company

practices, terms and conditions of employment of employees, former employees
and prospective employees, wages and hours, pay equity, discrimination in

employment-related matters.

 

(c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has paid in full to all of its
employees or adequately accrued in accordance with GAAP all wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation due to or on behalf of
such employees. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has properly

appropriate filings in connection with services provided by, and compensation
paid to, such Service Providers.

(d) During the three years prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in or effectuated any
"plant closing" or employee "mass layoff" (in each case, as defined in the
Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any

Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were complete
and correct in all material respects. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
have duly paid (or there has been paid on their behalf), or made adequate
provisions in accordance with GAAP for, all material amounts of Taxes required
to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax Return. True and
materially complete copies of all United States federal income Tax Returns
that have been filed with the IRS by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to the taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2013 have
been provided or made available to DLR.

 

(b) The Company was formed under the laws of Maryland as a corporation on
March 2, 2007. On April 17, 2007, the Company filed an election to be treated
as an S corporation with an effective date of March 2, 2007. The Company filed
a second S-corporation election on July 27, 2007 and requested relief for
filing late. The Company received a letter, dated December 11, 2007, from the
IRS acknowledging that its S-corporation election was effective as of the date
of the Companys formation. The Company revoked its tax status as an S
corporation by filing a properly executed statement providing that it revokes
the election made under Code Section 1362(a) (the " _Revocation Statement_ ")
effective as of October 23, 2007 (the " _Revocation Date_ "). The Company
obtained the properly executed consent of stockholders holding a majority of
its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the Revocation Date and
attached such consents to the Revocation Statement. The Revocation Statement
and the stockholder consents attached thereto and the filing of such
Revocation Statement complied in all respects with the requirements set forth
under Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1362-6(a)(3) and 1.1362-6(b).

(c) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with the

has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to

manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate (including with regard to the REIT
distribution requirements in the taxable year that includes and/or ends on the
Closing Date) in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year
that will end with the Company Merger; and (iv) has not to its knowledge taken
or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Entity to its status as a
REIT, and to the knowledge of the Company, no such challenge is pending or
threatened.

 

(d) (i) There are no current disputes, audits, examinations, investigations or
other proceedings pending with regard to any material amounts of Taxes or
material Tax Returns of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a part of any Legal
Proceeding relating to Taxes; (ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have not received a written notice or announcement of any audits,
examinations, investigation or other proceedings; (iii) no deficiency for
Taxes of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has been claimed,
proposed or assessed, or threatened, in each

 



27  case, in writing, by any Governmental Entity, which deficiency has not yet
been settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good
faith or with respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has in the past three years received a claim in writing by a
Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction in which it does not file Tax Returns
or pay any Taxes that it is or may be subject to taxation by that

limited liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for United States federal
income tax purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation. No Company Subsidiary is a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation that qualifies as
a REIT, a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. _Section
3.13(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list
of (i) the classification for United States federal income tax purposes of

(including capital account balances) held, directly or indirectly, by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in each entity treated as a partnership for

or similar provisions under any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and
timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to the appropriate taxing

Company Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, " _Company Tax Protection
Agreements_ " means any written agreement to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party pursuant to which: (i) any liability to holders
of limited partnership interests in a Company Subsidiary Partnership relating
to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a result of the consummation of the

particular method for allocating one or more liabilities of such party or any
of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries under Section 752 of the Code. As used
herein, " _Company Subsidiary Partnership_ " means a Company Subsidiary that
is a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.

(j) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary except for Permitted Liens.

(k) There are no Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except for customary indemnification provisions contained in

by any such Tax allocation agreements or similar arrangements or have any
liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the

Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes under Sections

Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than
(x) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, or
(y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with acquisitions or

circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax
described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries.

(m) (i) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has extended
or waived (nor granted any extension or waiver of) the limitation period for
the assessment or collection of any material Tax that has not since expired;
and (ii) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries currently is
the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax
Return that remains unfiled.

(n) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) has been a member of

successor, by contract (excluding customary indemnification provisions
contained in credit or other commercial agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business and the primary purposes of which do not relate to
Taxes), or otherwise.

any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law),

or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Entity or has entered
into any written agreement with a Governmental Entity with respect to any
Taxes.

another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a

currently is in force with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

(t) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent the Company
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or (ii) prevent the Partnership Merger from qualifying as
an "assets-over" merger pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(3)(i).

 

(u) No compensation has been or would reasonably be expected to be includable
in the gross income of any "service provider" (within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of the
operation of Section 409A of the Code.

 

(v) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will result in any "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state, local, or foreign Tax Law) with respect to any Service Provider of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(w) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company

the Company Board of Directors of the Transactions and that are not an
express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed a Company

set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by any Subsidiary of the Company or

connection with the Partnership Merger and the Company and the Company OP
will cooperate in the preparation of such Form S-4 pursuant to this _Section_

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the DLR Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or
DLR, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or DLR which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or DLR,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form

and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board of Directors
shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by

sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, DLR may require the
Company, and the Company shall have the right, to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholder Meeting up to two (2) times (provided, that the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more
than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting

required by applicable Law)); _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Company
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled if the Company shall have received proxies in
respect of an aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock, which have
not been withdrawn, such that the Company Stockholder Approval will be
obtained at such meeting.

of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the DLR
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the DLR
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, if, on a date for which the DLR Stockholder Meeting

not a quorum is present, the Company may require DLR, and DLR shall have the
right, to adjourn or postpone the DLR Stockholder Meeting up to two (2)

which the DLR Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law)); _provided_ ,

at such meeting. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve DLR of its obligation to submit the Mergers and the issuance of the
DLR Common Stock in the Mergers to its stockholders, in each case, for a vote
on the approval thereof.

 

(e) The Company and DLR will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the DLR Stockholder Meeting on the
same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ will
limit the rights of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ of this

neither the Company nor DLR shall be required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ to
provide the other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access
to or to disclose information, (x) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable

 



77  disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty) or (z) that is subject to
any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that
does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege). Each of the Company and DLR will use its
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder.

 

(b) Each of the Company and DLR will hold, and will cause its Representatives
and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, in confidence to the extent

to the Company only, of any written notice received from any Person in
connection with (I) any violation or default under or notice to terminate, not
renew or challenge the validity or enforceability of any Company Material
Contract or any Material Company Lease or (II) any event or circumstance that
would give rise to any option to purchase, right of first refusal or first
offer, or any other right to purchase in favor of any Person under any
Company Material Contract or Material Company Lease, which, in each case of
clause (I) or (II) would, individually, cause losses to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of more than $5,000,000 or, in the aggregate, cause losses
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary of more than $1,000,000, (ii) of any
Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against,
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in
each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the
Mergers or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware of
the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event, change, development or
circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the DLR
Subsidiaries, respectively, which makes or is reasonably likely to make any of
the conditions set forth in Article VII to not be satisfied. The failure to
deliver any such notice, in and of itself, shall not result in the failure of,
or otherwise affect, any of the conditions set forth in Article VII.

 

(d) DLR shall have the right, but not the obligation, at DLRs sole cost, to
attempt to cause a national title company designated by DLR (a " _Title
Company_ ") to deliver as of the Closing, (i) (A) with respect to any Company
Property that is owned in fee, an ALTA Form B (revised 2006) extended coverage

Title Policies_ "). The Company and Company Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Title Companies such
customary statements,

 



78  releases, undertakings, affidavits, instruments and indemnities as the Title
Companies shall reasonably require to issue the Updated Title Policies,
provided no officer, employee or other agent of the Company shall be
obligated to assume any personal obligation in connection therewith. For the
avoidance of doubt, the receipt of any Updated Title Policies shall not be a
condition to Closing.

reasonably possible (" _Antitrust Clearances_ "), and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and
the other Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement (including this _Section
6.2(a)_ ) shall require or obligate DLR or any of its affiliates to, and the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of DLR, in each case in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Mergers, (A) commence or defend any litigation with any

Closing, in connection with obtaining any authorization, consent,
Order, registration or approval of a Governmental Entity or (C) agree or
otherwise be required to sell, divest, dispose of, license, hold separate, or
take or commit to take any action that limits in any respect its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any businesses, products,
rights, services, licenses, or assets of DLR, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or any interest or interests therein, except that, to
the extent necessary in order to avoid or lift a preliminary or permanent
injunction (including, without limitation, if the staff has recommended a suit
to enjoin the Transactions to the front office) sought by any Governmental
Entity that would prevent the Closing, DLR will agree to do the following and
no more than the following: DLR shall offer and continue to offer to agree to
divest, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of one or more of its

 



79  or its Subsidiaries properties (excluding any internet gateway property) or
one or more of the Companys or its Subsidiaries properties, up to but not
exceeding, in the aggregate, 37 megawatts of critical power capacity (an "
_Acceptable Action_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as DLR has
offered an Acceptable Action in order to obtain Antitrust Clearances, DLR
shall not be required to undertake any other (x) sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of the Company or DLR or
their respective Subsidiaries; (y) action with respect to the Company or DLR
or their respective Subsidiaries that may limit DLRs, the Companys or their
respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to the operation of
their respective businesses; or (z) action of any type.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of DLR and the
Company shall give (or shall cause to be given) any notices to any Person,
and each of DLR and the Company shall use, and cause each of their respective
affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from any
Person not covered by _Section 6.2(a)_ that are necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Mergers. Each of the Parties will furnish to

Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other Party of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings or communications between either Party and
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the extent
reasonably practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall have the
right to review in advance and each of the Parties will consult the others on,
all the information relating to the other and each of their affiliates that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other
Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive business
information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably
practicable, neither the Company nor DLR shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or
engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party
prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other Party the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval or
consent from any Person pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)_ shall not be a
condition to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Mergers.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Mergers, none of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, DLR or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay to such
Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation to such Person prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect
to reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain
such consents. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no approval or consent
of any such Person is a condition to the obligations of any Party to effect
the Mergers.

 



80 (d) DLR shall take the lead in coordinating communications with any
Governmental Entity, developing strategy for responding to any investigation
or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity and formulating proposals to any
Governmental Entity related to the consents, approvals or any other matter
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_. DLR shall consult in advance with
Company and take Companys views into account in making any such
determination.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor DLR, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the
Mergers or this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect
to the Mergers or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on
a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company shall not be
required to provide any such review or comment to DLR in connection with the
receipt and existence of a Competing Proposal and matters related thereto or a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _further_ , each Party and
their respective controlled affiliates may make oral statements that are not
inconsistent with previous written press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by DLR and the Company in compliance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_; _provided_ , _further_ , that DLR shall not be required
to provide any such review or opportunity to comment to the Company, in
connection with any prospectus, "road show" materials, press release, or
other written materials in connection with any issuance of DLR Equity
Interests or other capital raising initiatives as permitted by _Section_ __ _
5.2_ so long as such statements are consistent in substance with previous
written press releases, written public disclosures or other written statements
made by DLR and the Company in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and
not adverse to the consummation of the Mergers.

 

Section 6.4 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance and
Indemnification_.

 

(a) DLR shall honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company
to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, under the Company

_Indemnification Agreements_ ") to the individuals covered by such
Company Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements (the " _Covered
Persons_ ") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section_ _6.4(a)_ , for a period of
six (6) years after the Company Merger Effective Time, DLR (but only to the

indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against and from any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,

 



81  losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,

Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, DLR shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for which

sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from
or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Company Merger
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that DLR shall not be obligated to
make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company
for such insurance (such 300% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only
be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, DLR shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Base Premium.

occurs, DLR will provide (or cause an affiliate of DLR to provide) to each
employee of DF Property Management LLC and each employee of Moose Ventures LP,
in each case, who continues in employment with DLR or one of its
affiliates following the Closing (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with:
(i) a base salary or an hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no lower than
the base salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) (A) with respect to the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31 of the year in which
the Closing Date occurs, annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less
favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunities provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (B) with respect to
the period from January 1 through December 31 of the calendar year following
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, annual cash bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable than the annual cash bonus
opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of DLR, and (iii)
health and welfare benefits (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity
compensation, severance and retirement benefits) that are no less favorable,
in the aggregate, than those provided to either similarly situated employees
of DLR or to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and participation under
DLR Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees participate after the
Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before
the Closing Date, to credit for such service under Company Benefit Plans,
except to the extent providing such credit would result in any duplication of
benefits. In addition, DLR shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
(i) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
any DLR Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or
vision benefits to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements
applied to the Continuing Employee under comparable Company Benefit Plans);
and (ii) any co-payments, deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and/or his or her covered dependents during the plan
year ending on the Closing Date to be credited for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year of each comparable DLR Benefit Plan (to the extent such credit would
have been given under comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing).

 

(c) DLR shall maintain (or cause an affiliate of DLR to maintain) the
Companys 2017 Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _2017 STIP_ "),
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, until at least the end of
calendar year 2017, and shall pay (or cause an affiliate of DLR to pay) to
each Continuing Employee who was a participant in the 2017 STIP immediately
prior to the Closing Date an award thereunder for calendar year 2017, in
accordance with the terms thereof, with such modifications, if any, to the
performance objectives as DLR deems appropriate to reflect the Transactions,
subject to each such Continuing Employees continued employment with DLR or
an affiliate thereof through December 31, 2017, payable at such time(s) as DLR
may determine, but in no event later than March 15, 2018; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each such Continuing
Employees payout under the 2017 STIP in respect of calendar year 2017 shall
be no less than his or her target award opportunity thereunder as in effect on
the date hereof.

 



83 (d) Unless the Company is otherwise notified in writing by DLR no later than
fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing, the Company shall take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary to terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements
under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) each severance and employment agreement set forth on Section 3.11(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, and to fully perform under such plan and
agreements in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of clarity, this
_Section 6.5(e)_ is intended to satisfy the Companys (or the appropriate
Company Subsidiarys) obligations under the Companys Severance Benefit Plan
and the applicable severance or employment agreements that the Company (or the
appropriate Company Subsidiary) obtain a written agreement from any successor
to fully assume the Companys (or the appropriate Company Subsidiarys)
obligations and to perform under such plan and agreements.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed so as to,
(i) prevent or restrict in any way the right of DLR to terminate, reassign,
promote or demote any Service Provider of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or to cause any of the foregoing actions) at any time following
the Closing, or to change (or to cause the change of) the title, powers,
duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other compensation
or terms or conditions of employment or service of any such Service Providers
at any time following the Closing, subject to _Section 6.5(a)_  _(c)_ and the
terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plans; (ii) constitute an amendment
or modification of any Company Benefit Plan or DLR Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan; or (iii) create any third party rights in any such current or
former Service Provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof); or (iv) obligate DLR or any of its
affiliates to adopt or maintain any particular plan or program or other

Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take
all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other Transactions. The Company shall
not take any action to exempt any Person (other than DLR and, at the request
of DLR, its affiliates) from any Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction that may
purport to be applicable to the Mergers or any of the other Transactions or
otherwise cause any restrictions in any Takeover Statute not to apply to any
such Person, except in connection with the concurrent termination of this
Agreement and entry into a Company Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_.

 



84 Section 6.7 _Obligations of DLR and DLR OP_. DLR shall take all action

Exchange Act as a result of the Transactions) to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Upon request, the Company will promptly
furnish DLR with all requisite information for DLR to take the

Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

Representatives by security holders of the Company, or is brought against DLR

and settlement of any such litigation against the Company and/or its directors
by security holders of the Company, and no settlement thereof shall be agreed
to without DLRs written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.11 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause to be delivered to DLR resignations executed by each

respect; (iii) to provide such cooperation to the extent it would cause any
condition to Closing set forth in Article VII to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement; (iv) to take any action that
will conflict with or violate its respective organizational documents or any
applicable laws or result in the contravention of, or would reasonably

respective indentures governing the applicable series of Notes (as defined

payable in connection with any Consent Solicitation. At DLRs expense,

legal opinions in customary form and scope relating to the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and/or the indentures governing the Notes required in

(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that consummation of any financing
transaction, public or private offering, Exchange Offer, consent solicitation
and/or tender of Notes contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ is not a
condition to any Partys obligation to consummate the Mergers.

Section 6.14 _Dividends_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Company
Merger Effective Time and termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_

other Party shall not be required for the authorization and payment of the
Company Permitted Dividend or the DLR Permitted Dividends, as applicable,

any DLR Subsidiary shall be permitted (without the consent of the other Party)
to declare and make dividends and distributions, including under Sections 858

distributions prior to the Closing is necessary for the Company or DLR, as
applicable, to maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or applicable
state Law and avoid the imposition of any entity level income or excise Tax
under the Code or applicable state Law. If either Party determines that it is
necessary to declare a dividend or distribution (whether a Company Permitted
Dividend, a DLR Permitted Dividend or otherwise), it shall notify the other
Party as soon as reasonably practicable prior to such declaration.

the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units receive the
Company Permitted Dividend for a particular period prior to the Closing Date,
or the holders of DLR Common Stock receive the DLR Permitted Common Dividend
for a particular period prior to the Closing Date, then the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Partnership Units or the holders of DLR Common Stock,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive the applicable
Permitted Dividend for such period as necessary to result in the holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units and the holders of DLR
Common Stock receiving the applicable Permitted Dividend covering the same
periods prior to the Closing Date. 

 



91 Section 6.15 _Registration Rights_. DLR and DLR OP will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the New DLR OP Units to be included on its existing

(a) Certain of the holders of Company Partnership Units, each as set forth on
Schedule A hereto, have agreed to enter into a New Tax Protection Agreement
with terms substantially as set forth in the Terms of New Tax Protection
Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , which a New Tax Protection
Agreement shall become effective as of and conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Closing. The Company and DLR shall jointly cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to offer to the holders of Company Partnership
Units who are Protected Partners (other than the holders of Company
Partnership Units set forth on Schedule A hereto) the opportunity to enter
into the same New Tax Protection Agreement and to enter into guarantees of
indebtedness of DLR OP as contemplated by the Terms of New Tax Protection
Agreement, to be effective as of and conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Closing, and the Company Operating Partnership will facilitate the mailing and
communications with such holders of Company Partnership Units to give them
such opportunity. The process for such communications and the content
thereof shall be as mutually agreed between the Company and DLR, each acting
in good faith.

(b) To the extent the Terms of the New Tax Protection Agreement set forth
actions to be taken by DLR or the Company or their affiliates, each such party
agrees to perform such actions in accordance therewith.

 

Section 6.17 _Loan Agreement_. In accordance with the process described in the

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to multiple provisions of this
Agreement, the Company may elect under which provision it is providing notice

Company Related Parties shall have any rights or claims against any third
party financing source in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or

amount that can be paid to the Termination Payee without causing the
Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code for the relevant taxable year, determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or
856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has
$4,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the Termination Payees
independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the Termination Payee receives
either (x) a letter from the Termination Payees counsel indicating that the
Termination Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in
this _Section 8.2(e)_ or (y) an opinion from the Termination Payees outside
counsel as described below in this _Section 8.2(e)_ , an amount equal to the
excess of such Termination Payment, less the amount payable under subclause
(A) above.

 

(ii) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to such
Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on
such terms (subject to this _Section 8.2(e)_ ) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow agent.
The payment or deposit into escrow of such Termination Payment pursuant to
this _Section 8.2(e)_ shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is
obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by wire transfer of same day funds. The escrow agreement
shall provide that such Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof
shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A) a letter from the
Termination Payees independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee without causing the
Termination Payee to fail to meet the

 



100  requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the
Termination Payee has $4,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (B) a letter from the
Termination Payees counsel indicating that (x) the Termination Payee received
a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of
such Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, or (y) the Termination Payees outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of such
Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of
such Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The Termination Payor
agrees to amend this _Section 8.2(e)_ at the reasonable request of the
Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of such Termination
Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without
causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist the Termination Payee in
obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in
each case, as described in this _Section 8.2(e)_. Any amount of such
Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.2(e)_.

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that neither
the Company Termination Payment nor the DLR Termination Payment is a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
DLR and DLR OP or the Company and Company Operating Partnership, as
applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Payment or
the DLR Termination Payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include
all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated

represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually,
electronically by email or by facsimile by the Parties, in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-_ _Party _ _Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the DLR

Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or

modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Mergers are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

determined in any Maryland state or federal court, (d) waives, to the fullest

hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding, and
(e) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each of
the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section_

IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 9.12_.

Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that DLR and DLR OP may assign, in their
sole discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of

Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of

Terms of New Tax Protection Agreement

The following is a summary of (i) the process for addressing the parties
obligations under the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement and (ii) the terms to be
included in the New Tax Protection Agreement, which will replace the 2007
Tax Protection Agreement with respect to the parties entering into the New
Tax Protection Agreement. The Limited Partners of the Company Operating
Partnership agreeing to such amendment at signing are referred to as
"Protected Partners" below. 

1\. Quill Loan and/or New Loan:



     |  |  | [Penguins] and [Capitals] will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate to obtain Keybanks consent for [Penguins] to
assume and otherwise waive acceleration of the existing loan (the
"Quill Loan") from Keybank to [Quill Equity LLC] in connection with the
transaction or, at [Penguins] option, obtain a new nonrecourse mortgage loan
in an amount equal to at least $104,000,000 (subject to reduction in the event
any current guarantors decide not to enter into a new guarantee), with a term
of five (5) years on a [Capitals] and/or [Penguins] asset with a value, as
determined in good faith by Penguins, at least equal to 150% of amount of the
loan (the "New Loan"). 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | In the event [Penguins] elects to assume the Quill Loan,
[Penguins] will obtain a New Loan with a term that does not end before the End
Date (as defined below) on or before the maturity date of the Quill Loan and
will provide the Protected Partners the opportunity to enter into a guarantee
of the New Loan on the "vertical slice" basis described below. 
---|---|---|--- 
 

2\. Allocation of Liabilities and Guarantee Opportunity:



     |  |  | The Protected Partners will agree to enter into a
"vertical slice" guarantee with respect to the Quill Loan and/or New Loan, as
applicable, or at their option waive their rights to guarantee
and indemnification under the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement. As used herein,
the term "vertical slice" guarantee means a guarantee structured so that it is
limited to a maximum amount (or percentage) of the applicable loan but that
qualifies for the exception from treatment as a "bottom dollar payment
obligation" set forth in Treas. Reg. 1.752-2T(a)(3)(ii)(C)(2). Except as
necessary to meet the requirement of the preceding sentence, the vertical
slice guarantee shall be in the form of the guarantees currently in place with
respect to the Quill Loan, __provided that__ the form of the guarantee shall
be subject to comment by, and must be satisfactory to, the
applicable lenders. The Protected Partners who agree to enter into a vertical
slice guarantee will agree that the arrangement has not resulted in a breach
of the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement, that the vertical slice guarantee
satisfies the obligations of [Penguins] under the New Tax Protection
Agreement and that [Penguins] is entitled to the benefit of a presumption
similar to the presumption set forth in Section 3.7 of the 2007 Tax Protection
Agreement. 
---|---|---|--- revised to equal $104,000,000 (subject to reduction in the event any current
guarantors decide not to enter into a new guarantee), allocated among the
Protected Partners in the same amount as they currently guarantee the Quill
Loan. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | The term Qualifying Indebtedness will be revised to
include debt that is recourse to or guaranteed by the Partnership, [Penguins]
or [Capitals OP] where the Protected Partner agrees to indemnify or hold
harmless [Penguins] for any payment it needs to make under such guarantee.
The definition will otherwise remain generally consistent with the existing
definition. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | [Penguins] will agree not to repay the New Loan prior to
March 1, 2023 (the "End Date") unless it provides the Protected Partners with
the opportunity to guarantee replacement Qualifying Indebtedness that matures
no earlier than the End Date. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Any obligations under the New Tax Protection Agreement
will terminate upon, and [Penguins] will have no obligation to provide any
guarantee or similar opportunity (including a DRO) to the Protected Partners
following the End Date. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Section 3.5 (addressing limitations on additional
guarantees) will be revised to provide that the Partnership, [Penguins] or the
[Capitals OP] may guarantee the New Loan, and in such case, the Protected
Partners will agree to indemnify and hold harmless [Penguins] for any payment
it needs to make under the guarantee (with the language implementing such
undertaking to be similar to Section 15 of the current guarantees with respect
to the Quill Loan, with such modifications thereto as [Penguins] determines
in good faith, after consultation with its tax advisers, are necessary or
appropriate to help insure that the guarantee arrangement will be respected
for tax purposes). 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | Section 3.9 (addressing additional guarantee and DRO
opportunities) will be deleted. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | The other provisions of Article 3 (e.g., process, deficit
restoration obligation and presumptions) will generally remain consistent with
the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement. 
---|---|---|--- 
 

3\. Remedies for Breach: In the event of a breach of the New Tax Protection
Agreement, the damages will generally be calculated in the manner set forth
in the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement.

4\. 704(c) method: [Penguins] agrees to use the "traditional method"
under Section 704(c), consistent with Section 5.1 of the 2007 Tax Protection
Agreement.

 



2 5\. Allocations of Liabilities (Article 6).

 



     |  |  | Section 6.1 (regarding allocation methods to be followed)
will be revised to take into account the changes being made to the agreement. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | Section 6.2 (regarding exceptions to using the required
allocation method) will be revised to clarify that, in the event [Penguins]
determines that it is not more likely than not that a relevant allocation will
be respected, subject to receiving an opinion of a tax advisor as described
in such section, [Penguins] will have no obligation to make the applicable
allocations and shall have no obligation to pay any damages to the Protected
Partners.  
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Section 6.3 (which generally provides that the parties
will cooperate to develop an alternative allocation method in the event the
intended allocation method is no longer supportable, as described in Section
6.2) will be revised to clarify that any revised arrangements will be
determined by [Penguins] in its sole discretion, and that, in the event
[Penguins] concludes in good faith it is not reasonably able to protect the
federal income tax positions of the Protected Partners in the manner
contemplated by the New Tax Protection Agreement, [Penguins] will have no
obligation to indemnify the Protected Partners. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event the intended allocation method is no longer supportable, in
determining whether [Penguins] is reasonably able to protect the federal
income tax positions of the Protected Partners in a manner contemplated by the
New Tax Protection Agreement, [Penguins] shall not be required to structure
or restructure its activities or assets or incur any new debt or other
obligation if such action would be adverse to [Penguins] or its affiliates
and/or require [Penguins] or any of its affiliates to incur any non-de minimis
cost, in each case, as determined by [Penguins] in its sole discretion. 
---|---|---|--- 

6. Tax Proceedings: [Penguins] and each of the Protected Partners, as
applicable, will provide notice to the Protected Partners or [Penguins], as
applicable, regarding tax proceedings related to the guarantees, allocations
or other matters addressed in the New Tax Protection Agreement. [Penguins]
will agree to provide ongoing tax reporting information. [Penguins] will
control tax proceedings.

 

7\. Successors: The New Tax Protection Agreement will include provisions
substantially similar to those in the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement. 

8\. No Further Obligations: The New Tax Protection Agreement will include a
provision to the effect that the Protected Partners agree that, with respect
to the Protected Partners, the New Tax Protection Agreement supersedes the
existing agreement in its entirety and terminates the 2007 Tax Protection
Agreement, and all prior breaches of the 2007 Tax Protection Agreement
with respect to the Protected Partners, if any, are released effective as of
the effective date of the New Tax Protection Agreement. It will further
provide that, provided [Penguins] has complied with the terms of the New Tax
Protection Agreement, [Penguins] will have no obligation to pay any damages
in the event the Internal Revenue Service or any other tax authority
challenges the allocation of liabilities to the Protected Partners. All
obligations of [Penguins] under the New Tax Protection Agreement will
terminate on the End Date.

 



3 9\. Misc.: Deletion of several provisions of the 2007 Tax Protection
Agreement, including Article 2 (sale protection), Section 3.9 (regarding
additional guarantee and DRO opportunities), Section 7.2 (control of tax
proceedings), among others and related definitions.

 

10\. Process for Offering Other Limited Partners the Opportunity to Enter into
the New Tax Protection Agreement and/or Enter Into Vertical Slice Guarantees.



     |  |  | [Penguins] and [Capitals] shall cooperate in good faith
to obtain the agreement of all current parties to the 2007 Tax Protection
Agreement to enter into the New Tax Protection Agreement. Consistent with the
foregoing, [Penguins] and [Capitals] shall prepare a written communication to
all such partners, to be mutually approved by [Penguins] and [Capitals], each
in their reasonable discretion, to be mailed not later than [30 days]
following the execution of the Merger Agreement, explaining the opportunity
and encouraging the recipients to enter into the New Tax Protection Agreement. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | [Penguins] and [Capitals] also shall cooperate in good
faith to offer to all holders of Company Partnership Units who have executed
guarantees with respect to the Quill Loan to enter into a vertical slice
guarantee with respect to the Quill Loan or the New Loan, as applicable.
Consistent with the foregoing, [Penguins] and [Capitals] shall prepare a
written communication to all such partners, to be mutually approved by
[Penguins] and [Capitals], each in their reasonable discretion, to be mailed
not later than [60 days] prior to the expected date for the closing of the
Mergers, explaining the opportunity and encouraging the recipients to enter
into the vertical slice guarantee. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | It also shall not be a condition to any holders
opportunity to enter into a vertical slice guarantee with respect to the Quill
Loan or the New Loan, as applicable, that such holder agree to enter into the
New Tax Protection Agreement, but such holder shall be required, in
connection with entering into such vertical slice guarantee, to agree that
such guarantee satisfies the obligations of [Penguins] under the 2007 Tax
Protection Agreement with respect to such loan.

and conditions of such 6.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual
Preferred Stock, and authorized the issuance of up to 8,050,000 shares of

 _SECOND_ : The designation, number of shares, preferences, conversion and
other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and
other distributions, transfers, qualifications, terms and conditions of
redemption and other terms and conditions of the separate class of Preferred
Stock of the Company designated as the 6.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Perpetual Preferred Stock are as follows, which upon any restatement of the
Charter shall be made a part of or incorporated by reference into the Charter
with any necessary or appropriate changes to the enumeration or lettering of
Sections or subsections thereof:

Section 1\. _Designation and Number_. A series of preferred stock, designated
as the "6.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock" (the " _Series
C Preferred Stock_ "), is hereby established. The par value of the Series C
Preferred Stock is $0.01 per share. The number of shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be 8,050,000. 

Section 2\. _Ranking_. The Series C Preferred Stock will, with respect to
rights to receive dividends and to participate in distributions or payments
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, rank (a) senior to
the Common Stock (as defined in the Charter) and any other capital stock of
the Company, now or hereafter issued and outstanding, the terms of which
provide that such capital stock ranks, as to dividends and upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company, junior to such Series C Preferred
Stock (" _Junior Shares_ "); (b) on a parity with the Series G Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, the Series H Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the Series I
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the

and outstanding, other than the capital stock referred to in clauses (a) and
(c) (" _Parity Shares_ "); and (c) junior to all capital stock of the
Company the terms of which specifically provide that such capital stock ranks
senior to the Series C Preferred Stock.

Section 3.  _Dividends_.

(a) Holders of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board and declared
by the Company, out of funds legally available for payment of dividends,
cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.625% per annum of the $25
liquidation preference of each share of Series C Preferred Stock (equivalent
to $1.65625 per annum per share). (b) Dividends on each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock shall
accrue and be cumulative from and including the first date on which any
shares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued (the " _Original Issue Date_ ")
and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date (as
defined below), commencing [], 2017, provided, however, that if any Dividend
Payment Date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the dividend which
would otherwise have been payable on such Dividend Payment Date may be paid,
at the Companys option, on either the immediately preceding Business Day or
the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the
next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if
paid on such Dividend Payment Date, and no interest or additional dividends or
other sums shall accrue on the amount so payable from such Dividend Payment
Date to such next succeeding Business Day. The amount of any dividend payable
on the Series C Preferred Stock for any partial Dividend Period (as defined
below) shall be prorated and computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of
record as they appear in the stockholder records of the Company at the close
of business on the applicable Dividend Record Date (as defined
below). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, each
outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a
dividend with respect to any Dividend Record Date equal to the dividend paid
with respect to each other share of Series C Preferred Stock that is
outstanding on such date. " _Dividend Record Date_ " shall mean the date
designated by the Board for the payment of dividends that is not more than 35
or fewer than 10 days prior to the applicable Dividend Payment Date. "
_Dividend Payment Date_ " shall mean the last calendar day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing on [], 2017. " _Dividend Period_ "
shall mean the respective periods commencing on and including the first day
of January, April, July and October of each year and ending on and including
the day preceding the first day of the next succeeding Dividend Period (other
than the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on the Original Issue
Date and end on and include [], 2017, and other than the Dividend Period
during which any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemed pursuant
to Section 5 hereof, which shall end on and include the day preceding the
redemption date with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock being
redeemed).

(c) No dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock shall be authorized and
declared by the Board or paid or set apart for payment by the Company at such
time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Company, including
any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such declaration,
payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such declaration,
payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof, or a
default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be restricted or
prohibited by law.

(d) So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, no
dividends, except as described in the immediately following sentence, shall
be authorized and declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series or
class or classes of Parity Shares for any period unless full cumulative
dividends have been declared and paid or are contemporaneously declared and
paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for
such payment on the Series C Preferred Stock for all prior dividend periods.
When dividends are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is
not set apart, as aforesaid, all dividends authorized and declared upon the
Series C Preferred Stock and all dividends authorized and declared upon any
other series or class or classes of Parity Shares shall be authorized and
declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends
accumulated and unpaid on the Series C Preferred Stock and such Parity Shares.

 

(e) So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, no
dividends (other than dividends or distributions paid solely in Junior Shares
of, or in options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase, Junior
Shares) shall be authorized and declared or paid or set apart for payment or
other distribution authorized and declared or made upon Junior Shares, nor
shall any Junior Shares be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other
than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Common Stock made for
purposes of and in compliance with requirements of an employee incentive or
benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary, or a conversion into or
exchange for Junior Shares or redemptions for the purpose of preserving the
Companys qualification as a REIT (as defined in Section 9(a) hereof)), for
any consideration (or any monies to be paid to or made available for a
sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company, directly
or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Shares),
unless in each case full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock and any Parity Shares at the time such dividends
are payable shall have been paid or set apart for payment for all past
dividend periods with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock and all past
dividend periods with respect to such Parity Shares. (f) Any dividend payment made on the Series C Preferred Stock shall first be
credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to
such shares which remains payable.

(g) Except as provided herein, the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to participate in the earnings or assets of the Company.

(h) As used herein, the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day, other
than a Saturday or a Sunday, which is not a day on which banking institutions
in New York, New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or
executive order to close.

 

(i) As used herein, the term " _dividend_ " does not include dividends payable
solely in shares of Junior Shares on Junior Shares, or in options, warrants
or rights to holders of Junior Shares to subscribe for or purchase any Junior
Shares.

Section 4.  _Liquidation Preference_.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the
assets of the Company shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior
Shares, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive $25 per share (the "Liquidation Preference") plus an amount per share
equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accumulated and
unpaid thereon to, but not including, the date of final distribution to such
holders; but such holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to any further payment. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, the assets of the Company, or proceeds thereof,
distributable among the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be
insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating
payments on any other Parity Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds
thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of such Series C Preferred
Stock and any such other Parity Shares ratably in accordance with the
respective amounts that would be payable on such Series C Preferred Stock and
any such other Parity Shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.
For the purposes of this Section 4, none of (i) a consolidation or merger of
the Company with one or more entities, (ii) a statutory stock exchange or
(iii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Companys assets
shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or
involuntary, of the Company.

(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of Parity Shares, upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, after payment shall
have been made in full to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, as
provided in this Section 4, any series or class or classes of Junior
Shares shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying
thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or
distributed, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to share therein.

 

Section 5\. _Optional Redemption_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise permitted by the Charter and paragraph (b) below, or
to preserve the status of the Company as a REIT (as defined in Section 9(a)
hereof) for United States federal income tax purposes, the Series C Preferred
Stock shall not be redeemable by the Company prior to May 15, 2021. On and
after May 15, 2021, the Company, at its option, upon giving notice
as provided below, may redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole, at any
time, or in part, from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00
per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred
Stock (whether or not declared), to, but not including, the redemption date
(the " _Regular Redemption Right_ ").

(b) Upon a Change of Control (as defined below), the Company will have the
option, upon giving notice as provided below, to redeem the Series C Preferred
Stock, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, within 120 days
after the first date on which such Change of Control has occurred (the "
_Special Redemption Right_ "), for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per
share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred
Stock (whether or not declared), to, but not including, the redemption date
(the " _Special Redemption Price_ "). If, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date (as defined below), the Company has provided or provides
notice of redemption with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock (whether
pursuant to the Regular Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption
Right), the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will not have the
conversion right described below in Section 9\. If the Company provides
the notice described in Section 9(c) below of a holders right to exercise
the Change of Control Conversion Right, the Company may no longer exercise its
Special Redemption Right until the time period during which holders of Series
C Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right has
expired. A " _Change of Control_ " shall be deemed to have occurred at such time after
the original issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock when each of the
following has occurred:

(i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to
be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial
ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other
acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition
transactions of shares of the Company entitling that person to exercise more
than 50% of the total voting power of all shares of the Company entitled to
vote generally in elections of directors (except that such person will
be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has
the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is
exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and

 

(ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in clause (i) above,
neither the Company nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of
common securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), the
NYSE MKT LLC (" _NYSE MKT_ "), or the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ "), or
listed on an exchange that is a successor to the NYSE, NYSE MKT or NASDAQ.

(c) The following provisions set forth the procedures for redemption pursuant
to the Regular Redemption Right:

(i) A notice of redemption (which may be contingent upon the occurrence of a
future event) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the holders of record
of the Series C Preferred Stock at their addresses as they appear on the
Companys stock transfer records. A failure to give such notice or any defect
in the notice or in its mailing shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of
any exchange upon which the Series C Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted
to trading, each notice shall state: (A) the redemption date; (B) the
redemption price; (C) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be
redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by
such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder; (D) the place or places
where the certificates, if any, evidencing the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (E) that
dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such
redemption date except as otherwise provided herein.

(ii) At its election, the Company, prior to a redemption date, may
irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid
dividends to the redemption date) of the Series C Preferred Stock so called
for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust
company, in which case the redemption notice to holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B)
specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of
the redemption price and (C) require such holders to surrender the
certificates evidencing such shares at such place on or about the date fixed
in such redemption notice (which may not be later than the redemption date)
against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid
dividends to the redemption date). Subject to applicable escheat laws, any
monies so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the redemption date shall be
returned by such bank or trust company to the Company.

(iii) If fewer than all the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred
Stock are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot
or pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional shares).

 

(iv) Upon any redemption of Series C Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay
any accumulated and unpaid dividends in arrears for any dividend period
ending on or prior to the redemption date. If a redemption date falls after a
record date for a Series C Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date, then each holder of the Series C
Preferred Stock at the close of business on such record date shall be
entitled to the dividend payable on such Series C Preferred Stock on the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such
Series C Preferred Stock before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as
provided in this Section 5(c)(iv), the Company shall make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on any shares of
Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption. (v) If full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and any other
series or class or classes of Parity Shares have not been paid or declared
and set apart for payment, except for redemptions for the purpose of
preserving the Companys qualification as a REIT (as defined in the Section
9(a) hereof) or as otherwise permitted under the Charter, the Company may not
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
or any Parity Shares other than in exchange for Junior Shares.

 

(vi) On and after the date fixed for redemption, provided that the Company has
made available at the office of the registrar and transfer agent a sufficient
amount of cash to effect the redemption, dividends will cease to accumulate on
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption (except that, in
the case of a redemption date after a dividend payment record date and prior
to the related Series C Dividend Payment Date, holders of Series C Preferred
Stock on the applicable record date will be entitled on such Series C Dividend
Payment Date to receive the dividend payable on such shares on the
corresponding Series C Dividend Payment Date), such shares shall no longer be
deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares as
holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall cease except the right to receive
the cash payable upon such redemption, without interest from the date of such
redemption.

(d) The following provisions set forth the procedures for redemption pursuant
to the Special Redemption Right:

(i) A notice of redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, not less than 30
nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the holders
of record of the Series C Preferred Stock at their addresses as they appear on
the Companys stock transfer records. A failure to give such notice or any
defect in the notice or in its mailing shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock
except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. In addition
to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange
upon which the Series C Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading,
each notice shall state: (A) the redemption date; (B) the redemption price;
(C) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (D) the
place or places where the certificates, if any, evidencing the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price; and (E) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to
accrue on such redemption date except as otherwise provided herein.

(ii) At its election, the Company, prior to a redemption date,
may irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and
unpaid dividends to the redemption date) of the Series C Preferred Stock so
called for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust
company, in which case the redemption notice to holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B)
specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of
the redemption price and (C) require such holders to surrender the
certificates evidencing such shares at such place on or about the date fixed
in such redemption notice (which may not be later than the redemption date)
against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid
dividends to the redemption date). Subject to applicable escheat laws, any
monies so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the redemption date shall be
returned by such bank or trust company to the Company.

(iii) Upon the redemption of Series C Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay
any accumulated and unpaid dividends in arrears for any dividend period
ending on or prior to the redemption date. If the redemption date falls after
a record date for a Series C Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the
corresponding Series C Dividend Payment Date, then each holder of the Series
C Preferred Stock at the close of business on such record date shall be
entitled to the dividend payable on such Series C Preferred Stock on the
corresponding Series C Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption
of such Series C Preferred Stock before such Series C Dividend Payment Date.
Except as provided in Section 5(c)(iv), the Company shall make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on any shares of
Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption.

(iv) If full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and
any other series or class or classes of Parity Shares have not been paid or
declared and set apart for payment, except for redemptions for the purpose of
preserving the Companys qualification as a REIT (as defined in the Charter)
or as otherwise permitted under the Charter, the Company may not purchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire shares of the Series C Preferred Stock or any
Parity Shares other than in exchange for Junior Shares.

 

(v) On and after the date fixed for redemption, provided that the Company has
made available at the office of the registrar and transfer agent a sufficient
amount of cash to effect the redemption, dividends will cease to accumulate on
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption (except that, in
the case of a  redemption date after a dividend payment record date and prior to the
related Series C Dividend Payment Date, holders of Series C Preferred Stock on
the applicable record date will be entitled on such Series C Dividend Payment
Date to receive the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding
Series C Dividend Payment Date), such shares shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares as holders of Series
C Preferred Stock shall cease except the right to receive the cash payable
upon such redemption, without interest from the date of such redemption.

 

(e) Any shares of Series C Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been
redeemed shall, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but
unissued Preferred Stock, without designation as to series or class.

Section 6\. _Voting Rights_. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall
not have any voting rights, except as set forth in this Section 6\.

(a) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be in
arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive quarterly periods (a "
_Preferred Dividend Default_ "), the holders of such Series C Preferred Stock
(voting separately as a class together with holders of all other Parity Shares
(the " _Voting Preferred Shares_ "), shall be entitled to vote for the
election of a total of two additional directors of the Company (the "
_Preferred Directors_ ") until all dividends accumulated on such Series C
Preferred Stock and Parity Shares for the past Dividend Periods shall have
been fully paid. In such case, the entire Board will be increased by two
directors. The Preferred Directors will be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast in the election for a one-year term and each Preferred Director
will serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies or until
such Preferred Directors right to hold the office terminates, whichever
occurs earlier, subject to such Preferred Directors earlier death,
disqualification, resignation or removal. The election will take place at (i)
either a special meeting called in accordance with Section 6(b) below if the
request is received more than 90 days before the date fixed for the Companys
next annual or special meeting of stockholders or (B) the next annual or
special meeting of stockholders if the request is received within 90 days of
the date fixed for the Companys next annual or special meeting of
stockholders, and (ii) at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, or
special meeting held in place thereof, until all such dividends in arrears on
the Series C Preferred Stock and each such class or series of outstanding
Parity Preferred have been paid in full. A dividend in respect of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be considered timely made if made within two Business
Days after the applicable Dividend Payment Date if at the time of such late
payment date there shall not be any prior quarterly Dividend Periods in
respect of which full dividends were not timely made at the
applicable Dividend Payment Date.

(b) At any time when such voting rights shall have vested, a proper officer of
the Company shall call or cause to be called, upon written request of holders
of record of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock and Parity Shares, a special meeting of the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock and each class or series of Parity Shares by mailing or
causing to be mailed to such holders a notice of such special meeting to be
held not fewer than ten or more than 45 days after the date such notice is
given. The record date for determining holders of the Series C Preferred Stock
and Parity Shares entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting
will be the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the day on
which such notice is mailed. At any such annual or special meeting, all of the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and Parity Shares, by plurality vote,
voting together as a single class without regard to class or series will be
entitled to elect two directors on the basis of one vote per $25.00 of
liquidation preference to which such Series C Preferred Stock and Parity
Shares are entitled by their terms (excluding amounts in respect of
accumulated and unpaid dividends) and not cumulatively. The holder or holders
of one-third of the Series C Preferred Stock and Parity Shares voting as a
single class then outstanding, present in person or by proxy, will constitute
a quorum for the election of the Preferred Directors except as otherwise
provided by law. Notice of all meetings at which holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Parity Shares shall be entitled to vote will be given
to such holders at their addresses as they appear in the transfer records. At
any such meeting or adjournment thereof in the absence of a quorum, subject
to the provisions of any applicable law, a majority of the holders of the
Series C Preferred Stock and Parity Shares voting as a single class present in
person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting for the
election of the Preferred Directors, without notice other than an
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. If a Preferred
Dividend Default shall terminate after the notice of a special meeting has
been given but before such special meeting has been held, the Company shall,
as soon as practicable after such termination, mail or cause to be mailed
notice of such termination to holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and the
Parity Shares that would have been entitled to vote at such special meeting. (c) If and when all accumulated dividends on such Series C Preferred Stock and
all classes or series of Parity Shares for the past Dividend Periods shall
have been fully paid, the right of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and
the Parity Preferred to elect such additional two directors shall immediately
cease (subject to revesting in the event of each and every Preferred Dividend
Default), and the term of office of each Preferred Director so elected shall
terminate and the entire Board shall be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred
Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and
shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a
majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock and the Parity Shares
entitled to vote thereon when they have the voting rights set forth in
Section 6(a) hereof (voting as a single class). So long as a Preferred
Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred
Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Director remaining
in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record
of a majority of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock when they have the
voting rights described above (voting as a single class with all other classes
or series of Parity Preferred). Each of the Preferred Directors shall be
entitled to one vote on any matter.

(d) So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of
outstanding Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, either at
a meeting of stockholders or by written consent, is required (i) to amend,
alter or repeal any provisions of the Charter (including these Articles
Supplementary), whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, to affect
materially and adversely the voting powers, rights or preferences of the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, unless in connection with any such
amendment, alteration or repeal, the Series C Preferred Stock remains
outstanding without the terms thereof being materially changed in any
respect adverse to the holders thereof or is converted into or exchanged for
preferred stock of the surviving entity having preferences, conversion and
other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption thereof that are
substantially similar to those of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (ii) to
authorize, create, or increase the authorized amount of any class or series of
capital stock having rights senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with
respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up (provided that if such amendment affects materially and
adversely the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of one or
more but not all of the other series of Voting Preferred Shares, the consent
of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each such
series so affected is required). However, the Company may create additional
classes of Parity Shares and Junior Shares, amend the Charter and these
Articles Supplementary to increase the authorized number of shares of Parity
Shares (including the Series C Preferred Stock) and Junior Shares and
issue additional series of Parity Shares and Junior Shares without the
consent of any holder of Series C Preferred Stock.

(3) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the
time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required
shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient
funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.

Section 7.  _Information Rights_. During any period in which the Company is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
" _Exchange Act_ ") and any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the Company will (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible
means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series C Preferred Stock, as
their names and addresses appear in the record books of the Company and
without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports and quarterly
reports that the Company would have been required to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act if the Company were subject thereto (other than any exhibits
that would have been required) and (ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies
of such reports to any prospective holder of Series C Preferred Stock. The
Company will mail (or otherwise provide) the information to the holders of
Series C Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which a
periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of
such information would have been required to be filed with the SEC if the
Company were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 8\. _Conversion Upon a Change of Control_. The Series C Preferred
Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or
securities of the Company, except as provided in this Section 8\. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series C
Preferred Stock shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, the Company has provided or provides notice of its election
to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to the Regular Redemption
Right or Special Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder (the " _Change of Control
Conversion Right_ ") on the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date (as
defined herein) into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of Series C
Preferred Stock to be converted (the " _Common Stock Conversion Consideration_
") equal to the lesser of (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of
(x) $25.00, plus (y) an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends
(whether or not declared) to, but not including, the Change of Control
Conversion Date (as defined herein) except if such Change of Control
Conversion Date is after a record date for a Series C Preferred Stock
dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series C Dividend Payment
Date, in which case the amount pursuant to this clause (A)(y) shall equal
$0.00 in respect of such dividend payment to be made on such Series C Dividend
Payment Date, by (B) the Common Stock Price (such quotient, the "Conversion
Rate"), and (ii) 0.6389035 (the "Share Cap"), subject to the immediately
succeeding paragraph.

 

The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits
(including those effected pursuant to a Common Stock dividend), subdivisions
or combinations (in each case, a " _Share Split_ ") with respect to the Common
Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product of
(i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split multiplied
by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such Share Split.

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative
Conversion Consideration (as defined below)) issuable in connection with the
exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right shall not exceed 5,143,174
shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as
applicable) (the " _Exchange Cap_ "). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata
adjustments for any Share Splits with respect to Common Stock as follows: The
adjusted Exchange Cap as the result of a Share Split shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product of (i) the Exchange
Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split multiplied by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of
which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such Share Split.

In the case of a Change of Control as a result of which holders of Common
Stock are entitled to receive consideration other than solely shares of
Common Stock, including other securities, other property or assets (including
cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for shares of
Common Stock (the " _Alternative Form_ __ _ Consideration_"), a holder of
Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled thereafter to convert (unless,
prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has provided or
provides notice of its election to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock
pursuant to the Regular Redemption Right or Special Redemption Right) such
Series C Preferred Stock not into Common Stock but solely into the kind and
amount of Alternative Form Consideration which the holder of Series C
Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive upon such Change
of Control as if such holder of Series C Preferred Stock then held the Common
Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the
Change of Control (the " _Alternative Conversion Consideration_ "; and the
Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion
Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Control, shall be referred
to herein as the " _Conversion Consideration_ ").

If the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of
consideration to be received in such Change of Control, the Conversion
Consideration will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration
actually received by holders of a majority of the Common Stock that voted for
such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders
of a plurality of the Common Stock that voted for such an election (if
electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be,
and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Stock
are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to
any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control. The " _Change of Control Conversion Date_ " shall be a Business Day set forth
in the notice of Change of Control provided in accordance with Section 8(c)
below that is no less than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on
which the Company provides such notice pursuant to Section 8(c).

 

As used herein, " _Common Stock Price_ " shall mean (i) if the consideration
to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock is solely
cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock, (ii) if the
consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common
Stock is other than solely cash, the average of the closing price per share
of Common Stock on the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but
not including, the effective date of such Change of Control, and (iii) if
there is not a readily determinable closing price for the common stock, the
fair market value of the Alternative Form Consideration received in the Change
of Control per share of Common Stock as determined by the Board or a committee
thereof.

 

(b) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Series C Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, holders shall be
entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the
Common Stock Price.

(c) Unless the Company has exercised its Special Redemption Right in whole
during the 15 day period following the occurrence of a Change of Control,
within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, a notice of
occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of
Control Conversion Right, shall be delivered to the holders of record of the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock at their addresses as they appear on the
Companys share transfer records and notice shall be provided to
the Companys transfer agent. A failure to give such notice or any defect in
the notice or in its mailing shall not affect the validity of the proceedings
for the conversion of any share of Series C Preferred Stock except as to the
holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state:
(i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change
of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series C Preferred
Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right, which shall be
the Change of Control Conversion Date; (iv) the method and period for
calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date,
which shall be a Business Day occurring within 20 to 35 days following the
date of the notice; (vi) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative
Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series C
Preferred Stock; (vii) the name and address of the paying agent and the
conversion agent; and (viii) the procedures that the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion
Right.

 

(d) The Company shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones and
Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if
such organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of such press
release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to
broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or post notice
on the Companys website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the
first Business Day following any date on which the Company provides notice
pursuant to Section 8(c) above to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock.

 

(e) In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be required to deliver, on or before
the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the
certificates (if any) evidencing the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be
converted, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion
notice completed, to the Companys transfer agent. Such notice shall state:
(i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares
of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the applicable
provisions of these Articles Supplementary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held in global form, such notice
shall comply with applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ").

(f) Holders of Series C Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise
of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written
notice of withdrawal delivered to the Companys transfer agent prior to the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of
withdrawn shares of Series C Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated shares of
Series C Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the
withdrawn shares of Series C Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares
of Series C Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the conversion
notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are held in global form, the notice of withdrawal shall comply with
applicable DTC procedures. (g) Shares of Series C Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control
Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion
notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable
Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion
Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date.

(h) The Company shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration no later
than the third Business Day following the Change of Control Conversion Date.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Series C
Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock to the extent
that receipt of such shares of Common Stock would cause the holder of such
shares of Common Stock (or any other person) to have actual ownership,
Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership (each as defined in Section
9(a) hereof) in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)
hereof), the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)
hereof), or such other limit as permitted by the Board or a committee thereof
pursuant to Section 9(i) hereof.

Company being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code,
or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including but not limited to
Beneficial or Constructive Ownership that would result in the Company owning
(actually or Constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in
Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Company
(either directly or indirectly through one or more subsidiaries) from such
tenant would cause the Company to fail to satisfy any of the gross income
requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code).

 

(ii) If, prior to the Restriction Termination Date, any Transfer or other
event occurs that, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially or
Constructively Owning Series C Preferred Stock in violation of Section 9(b)(i)
of these Articles Supplementary, (A) then that number of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock that otherwise would cause such Person to violate
Section 9(b)(i) of these Articles Supplementary (rounded up to the nearest
whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of
a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 9(c), effective as of the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer or
other event, and such Purported Beneficial Transferee shall thereafter have no
rights in such shares or (B) if, for any reason, the transfer to the Trust
described in clause (A) of this sentence is not automatically effective as
provided therein to prevent any Person from Beneficially or Constructively
Owning Series C Preferred Stock in violation of Section 9(b)(i) of these
Articles Supplementary, then the Transfer of that number of shares of Series
C Preferred Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section
9(b)(i) shall be void _ab initio_ , and the Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall have no rights in such shares.

 

(iii) Subject to Section 9(l) and prior to the Restriction Termination Date,
any Transfer of Series C Preferred Stock that, if effective, would result in
the capital stock of the Company being beneficially owned by fewer than 100
Persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution) shall be
void _ab initio_ , and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights
in such Series C Preferred Stock.

(c) _Transfers of Series C Preferred Stock in Trust_.

 

(i) Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 9(b)(ii)
of these Articles Supplementary, such Series C Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to have been transferred to the Trustee in his capacity as trustee of a
Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. Such
transfer to the Trustee shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of
business on the Business Day prior to the purported Transfer or other event
that results in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to Section 9(b)(ii). The
Trustee shall be appointed by the Company and shall be a Person unaffiliated
with the Company, any Purported Beneficial Transferee or any Purported Record
Transferee. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the Company as
provided in Section 9(c)(vi) of these Articles Supplementary. (ii) Series C Preferred Stock held by the Trustee shall be issued and
outstanding Series C Preferred Stock of the Company. The Purported Beneficial
Transferee or Purported Record Transferee shall have no rights in the shares
of the Series C Preferred Stock held by the Trustee. The Purported Beneficial
Transferee or Purported Record Transferee shall not benefit economically from
ownership of any shares held in trust by the Trustee, shall have no rights to
dividends and shall not possess any rights to vote or other rights
attributable to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held in the Trust.

(iii) The Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends with
respect to Series C Preferred Stock held in the Trust, which rights shall be
exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any
dividend or distribution paid to or on behalf of the Purported Record
Transferee or Purported Beneficial Transferee prior to the discovery by
the Company that shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been transferred to
the Trustee shall be paid to the Trustee upon demand, and any dividend or
distribution declared but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Trustee with
respect to such Series C Preferred Stock. Any dividends or distributions so
paid over to the Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable
Beneficiary. The Purported Record Transferee and Purported Beneficial
Transferee shall have no voting rights with respect to the Series C Preferred
Stock held in the Trust and, subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date
the Series C Preferred Stock has been transferred to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall have the authority (at the Trustees sole discretion) (A) to rescind as
void any vote cast by a Purported Record Transferee with respect to such
Series C Preferred Stock prior to the discovery by the Company that the Series
C Preferred Stock has been transferred to the Trustee and (B) to recast
such vote in accordance with the desires of the Trustee acting for the
benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Company has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Trustee
shall not have the authority to rescind and recast such vote. Notwithstanding
any other provision of these Articles Supplementary to the contrary, until the
Company has received notification that the Series C Preferred Stock has been
transferred into a Trust, the Company shall be entitled to rely on its share
transfer and other stockholder records for purposes of preparing lists of
stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and
authority of proxies and otherwise conducting votes of stockholders.

(iv) Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company that shares of Series
C Preferred Stock have been transferred to the Trust, the Trustee of the
Trust shall sell the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held in the Trust to a
Person, designated by the Trustee, whose ownership of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in
Section 9(b)(i). Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock sold shall terminate and the Trustee
shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Purported Record
Transferee and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section
9(c)(iv). The Purported Record Transferee shall receive the lesser of (A) the
price paid by the Purported Record Transferee for the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the
Trust (or, if the event which resulted in the transfer to the Trust did not
involve a purchase of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock at Market Price,
the Market Price of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock on the day of the
event which resulted in the transfer of such shares of Series C Preferred
Stock to the Trust) and (B) the price per share received by the Trustee (net
of any commissions and other expenses of sale) from the sale or
other disposition of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held in the
Trust. The Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Purported Record
Transferee by the amount of dividends and distributions which have been paid
to the Purported Record Transferee and are owed by the Purported Record
Transferee to the Trustee pursuant to Section 9(c)(iii). Any net sales
proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Purported Record Transferee
shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary together with any
dividends or other distributions thereon. If, prior to the discovery by the
Company that shares of such Series C Preferred Stock have been transferred to
the Trustee, such shares of Series C Preferred Stock are sold by a Purported
Record Transferee then (1) such shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Trust and (2) to the extent that the
Purported Record Transferee received an amount for such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock that exceeds the amount that such Purported Record Transferee
was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 9(c)(iv), such excess shall
be paid to the Trustee upon demand.

 

(v) Series C Preferred Stock transferred to the Trustee shall be deemed to
have been offered for sale to the Company, or its designee, at a price per
share equal to the lesser of (A) the price paid by the Purported Record
Transferee for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock in the transaction that
resulted in such transfer to the  Trust (or, if the event which resulted in the transfer to the Trust did not
involve a purchase of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock at Market Price,
the Market Price of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock on the day of the
event which resulted in the transfer of such shares of Series C Preferred
Stock to the Trust) and (B) the Market Price on the date the Company, or its
designee, accepts such offer. The Company may reduce the amount payable to
the Purported Record Transferee by the amount of dividends and distributions
which have been paid to the Purported Record Transferee and are owed by the
Purported Record Transferee to the Trustee pursuant to Section 9(c)(iii). The
Company shall have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held in the Trust pursuant to Section
9(c)(iv). Upon such a sale to the Company, the interest of the
Charitable Beneficiary in the shares of Series C Preferred Stock sold shall
terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the
Purported Record Transferee and any dividends or other distributions held by
the Trustee with respect to such Series C Preferred Stock shall thereupon be
paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.

(vi) By written notice to the Trustee, the Company shall designate one or
more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest
in the Trust such that the Series C Preferred Stock held in the Trust would
not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 9(b)(i) in the hands of
such Charitable Beneficiary.

(d) _Remedies For Breach_. If the Board or a committee thereof or other
designees if permitted by the MGCL shall at any time determine in good faith
that a Transfer or other event has taken place in violation of Section 9(b) of
these Articles Supplementary or that a Person intends to acquire, has
attempted to acquire or may acquire beneficial ownership (determined without
reference to any rules of attribution), Beneficial Ownership or Constructive
Ownership of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company in
violation of Section 9(b) of these Articles Supplementary, the Board or a
committee thereof or other designees if permitted by the MGCL shall take such
action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect or to prevent such
Transfer, including, but not limited to, causing the Company to redeem shares
of Series C Preferred Stock, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the
books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Transfers (or, in the case of events other
than a Transfer, ownership or Constructive Ownership or Beneficial Ownership)
in violation of Section 9(b)(i) of these Articles Supplementary, shall
automatically result in the transfer to a Trust as described in Section
9(b)(ii) and any Transfer in violation of Section 9(b)(iii) shall
automatically be void _ab initio_ irrespective of any action (or non-action)
by the Board.

 

(e) _Notice of Restricted Transfer_. Any Person who acquires or attempts to
acquire shares of Series C Preferred Stock in violation of Section 9(b) of
these Articles Supplementary, or any Person who is a Purported Beneficial
Transferee such that an automatic transfer to a Trust results under Section
9(b)(ii) of these Articles Supplementary, shall immediately give written
notice to the Company of such event and shall provide to the Company such
other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect,
if any, of such Transfer or attempted Transfer on the Companys status as a
REIT.

 

(f) _Owners Required To Provide Information_. Prior to the Restriction
Termination Date each Person who is a beneficial owner or Beneficial Owner or
Constructive Owner of Series C Preferred Stock and each Person (including the
stockholder of record) who is holding Series C Preferred Stock for a
beneficial owner or Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner shall provide to
the Company such information that the Company may request, in good faith, in
order to determine the Companys status as a REIT.

(g)  _Remedies Not Limited_. Nothing contained in these Articles
Supplementary (but subject to Section 9(l) of these Articles Supplementary)
shall limit the authority of the Board to take such other action as it deems
necessary or advisable to protect the Company and the interests of its
stockholders by preservation of the Companys status as a REIT.

(h) _Ambiguity_. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the
provisions of this Section 9 of these Articles Supplementary, including any
definition contained in Section 9(a), the Board shall have the power to
determine the application of the provisions of this Section 9 with respect to
any situation based on the facts known to it (subject, however, to the
provisions of Section 9(l) of these Articles Supplementary). In the event
Section 9 requires an action by the Board and these Articles Supplementary
fail to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board shall
have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is
not contrary to the provisions of Section 9\. Absent a decision to the
contrary by the Board (which the Board may make in its sole and absolute
discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section
9(b)) acquired Beneficial  or Constructive Ownership of Series C Preferred Stock in violation of
Section 9(b)(i), such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the shares
of Series C Preferred Stock which, but for such remedies, would have been
actually owned by such Person, and second to shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or
Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among
the Persons who actually own such shares of Series C Preferred Stock based
upon the relative number of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by
each such Person.

 

(i) _Exceptions_.

(i) Subject to Section 9(b)(i)(C), the Board, in its sole discretion, may
exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a Person from the limitation on a
Person Beneficially Owning shares of Series C Preferred Stock in violation of
Section 9(b)(i)(A) if the Board determines that such exemption will not cause
any Individuals Beneficial Ownership of shares of Capital Stock to violate
the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and that such exemption will not cause the
Company to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code.

(ii) Subject to Section 9(b)(i)(C), the Board in its sole discretion, may
exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a Person from the limitation on a
Person Constructively Owning shares of Series C Preferred Stock in violation
of Section 9(b)(i)(B), if the Board determines that such ownership would not
cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code.

 

(iii) In granting a Person an exemption under Section 9(i)(i) or (ii) above,
the Board may require such Person to make certain representations or
undertakings or to agree that any violation or attempted violation of such
representations or undertakings (or other action which is contrary to the
restrictions contained in Section 9(b) of these Articles Supplementary)
will result in such Series C Preferred Stock being transferred to a Trust in
accordance with Section 9(b)(ii) of these Articles Supplementary. In granting
any exception pursuant to Section 9(i)(i) or (ii) of these Articles
Supplementary, the Board may require a ruling from the IRS, or an opinion of
counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board in its
sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine
or ensure the Companys status as a REIT.

15\. _Liability and Indemnification._

 

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations and conditions set

made a party) to, or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,  criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative proceeding
(hereinafter a " _Proceeding_ "), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any
inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was the Member or a manager or officer of the Company
or, while such person is or was serving at the request of the Company, as a
manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee,
agent, or similar functionary of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ "), shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest
extent permitted by law (including, without limitation, indemnification
against negligence, gross negligence or breach of duty) against judgments,
penalties (including excise and similar taxes and punitive damages), fines,
settlements and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys
fees) actually incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with such
Proceeding, if the Indemnified Person acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of
the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The indemnities hereunder shall
survive termination of the Company. Each Indemnified Person shall have a claim
against the property and assets of the Company for payment of any indemnity
amounts from time to time due hereunder, which amounts shall be paid
or properly reserved for prior to the making of distributions by the Company
to the Member. Indemnification under this section shall continue as to an

prior to any such amendment, modification or repeal.

(b) _Advance Payment_. The right to indemnification conferred in this section
shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Company the reasonable
expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person who was, is or is threatened to be
made a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of the Proceeding and without any determination as to the
Indemnified Persons ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided,
however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such Indemnified
Person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only
upon delivery to the Company of a written affirmation by such Indemnified
Person of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification under this section and a written
undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 14 or otherwise.

(c) _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the
advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this section shall not be
exclusive of any other right which the Member or other Indemnified Person
indemnified pursuant to this section may have or hereafter acquire under any
law (common or statutory), provision of the Certificate, this Agreement, any
other agreement, vote of Members or otherwise.

16\. _Limitation on Liability_. The Member shall not have any personal
liability whatsoever to the Company by reason of the Members acts or
omissions in connection with the conduct of the business of the Company;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall   protect the Member against any liability to the Company to which the Member
would otherwise be subject by reason of (i) any act or omission of the Member
that involves actual fraud or willful misconduct or (ii) any transaction from
which the Member derived improper personal benefit. The foregoing shall not
apply to any responsibility or liability under a criminal statute or liability
for the payment of taxes under Federal, state, or local law.

17\. _Disregarded Entity_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, at all times
that the Member owns 100% of the equity interests in the Company, the Company
and the Member intend that the Company be disregarded as an entity separate
from the Member pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701 and
corresponding provisions of state law. Accordingly, no election will be made
to treat the Company as a corporation for income tax purposes.

18\. _Dissolution and Winding Up_. The Company shall dissolve and its
business and affairs shall be wound up pursuant to a written instrument
executed by the Member.

19.  _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified from time to
time only by written instrument executed by the Member.

20.  _Governing Law_. The validity and enforceability of this Agreement shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Maryland without regard to otherwise governing principles of conflicts of law. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of
the date first noted above.

Partnership Agreement as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1.

DEFINED TERMS 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_.

 

The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly
indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.

" _Act_ " means the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as it
may be amended from time to time, and any successor to such statute. " _Additional Funds_ " shall have the meaning set forth in _Section 4.3.A_. 

" _Additional Limited Partner_ " means a Person admitted to the Partnership as
a Limited Partner pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2_ and who is shown as such
on the books and records of the Partnership.

" _Adjusted Capital Account Deficit_ " means, with respect to any Partner,
the deficit balance, if any, in such Partners Capital Account as of the end
of the relevant fiscal year, after giving effect to the following adjustments:

 



     | (i) | decrease such deficit by any amounts which such Partner is
obligated to restore pursuant to this Agreement or is deemed to be obligated
to restore pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) or the
penultimate sentence of each of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(5) and
1.704-2(g); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | increase such deficit by the items described in Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6). 
---|---|--- 
 

The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account Deficit is intended to
comply with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith. A positive balance in a Partners
Capital Account, after giving effect to the adjustments described above in
clauses (i) and (ii), is referred to in this Agreement as an "Adjusted
Capital Account Balance."

" _Adjusted Net Income_ " means for each fiscal year of the Partnership, an
amount equal to the Partnerships Net Income or Net Loss for such fiscal year,
computed without regard to the items set forth below, provided if the Adjusted
Net Income for such fiscal year is a negative number (i.e., a net loss), then
the Adjusted Net Income for that fiscal year shall be treated as if it was
zero:

(a) Depreciation; and 

(b) Net capital gain or loss realized in connection with the actual or
hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership, including but not limited to net capital gain or loss
treated as realized in connection with an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value
of the Partnerships assets as set forth in the definition of such term.

 

" _Adjustment Date_ " means, with respect to any Capital Contribution, the
close of business on the Business Day last preceding the date of the Capital
Contribution, _provided_ , _that_ if such Capital Contribution is being made
by the General Partner in respect of the proceeds from the issuance of REIT
Shares (or the issuance of the General Partners securities exercisable for,
convertible into or exchangeable for REIT Shares), then the Adjustment Date
shall be as of the close of business on the Business Day last preceding the
date of the issuance of such securities.

 

" _Adjustment Event_ " shall have the meaning set forth in _Section 4.5.A_.

 



7 " _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any Person directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such
Person. "Control" of any Person means the power to direct the management and
policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership
of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms "controlling"
and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

 

" _Agreed Value_ " means (i) in the case of any Contributed Property set forth
in _Exhibit A_ and as of the time of its contribution to the Partnership, the
Agreed Value of such property as set forth in _Exhibit A_ ; (ii) in the case
of any Contributed Property not set forth in _Exhibit A_ and as of the time of

The purpose and nature of the business to be conducted by the Partnership is
(i) to conduct any business that may be lawfully conducted by a limited
partnership organized pursuant to the Act, (ii) to enter into any partnership,
joint venture or other similar arrangement to engage in any business described
in the foregoing clause (i) or to own interests in any entity engaged,
directly or indirectly, in any such business and (iii) to do anything
necessary or incidental to the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
business shall be limited to and conducted in such a manner as to permit the
General Partner at all times to be classified as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, unless the General Partner ceases to qualify as a REIT for reasons
other than the conduct of the business of the Partnership. In connection with
the foregoing, and without limiting the General Partners right in its sole
discretion to cease qualifying as a REIT, the Partners acknowledge that the
General Partners current status as a REIT inures to the benefit of all the
Partners and not solely the General Partner.

Section 3.2 _Powers_

 

The Partnership is empowered to do any and all acts and things necessary,
appropriate, proper, advisable, incidental to or convenient for
the furtherance and accomplishment of the purposes and business described
herein and for the protection and benefit of the Partnership, including,
without limitation, full power and authority, directly or through its
ownership interest in other entities, to enter into, perform and carry out
contracts of any kind, borrow money and issue evidences of indebtedness,
whether or not secured by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or other lien,
acquire, own, manage, improve and develop real property, and lease, sell,
transfer and dispose of real property; _provided_ , _however_ ,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Partnership
shall not, absent the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or
withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, take, or refrain from taking,
any action which, in the judgment of the General Partner, in its sole and
absolute discretion, could (i) adversely affect the ability of the General
Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT,

 



30  (ii) subject the General Partner to any taxes under Section 857 or Section
4981 of the Code, or (iii) violate any law or regulation of any governmental
body or agency having jurisdiction over the General Partner or its
securities, unless any such action (or inaction) under (i), (ii) or (iii)
shall have been specifically consented to by the General Partner in writing.

 

Section 3.3 Partnership _Only for Purposes Specified_

 

The Partnership shall be a partnership only for the purposes specified in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to create a
partnership among the Partners with respect to any activities whatsoever other
than the activities within the purposes of the Partnership as specified in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no
Partner shall have any authority to act for, bind, commit or assume any
obligation or responsibility on behalf of the Partnership, its Properties or
any other Partner. No Partner, in its capacity as a Partner under this
Agreement, shall be responsible or liable for any indebtedness or obligation
of another Partner, nor shall the Partnership be responsible or liable for any
indebtedness or obligation of any Partner, incurred either before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Partner, except as to those
responsibilities, liabilities, indebtedness or obligations incurred pursuant
to and as limited by the terms of this Agreement and the Act.

 

Section 3.4 _Representations and Warranties by the Parties_

 

A. Each Partner that is an individual represents and warrants to each other
Partner that (i) such Partner has the legal capacity to enter into this
Agreement and perform such Partners obligations hereunder, (ii) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
performed by such Partner will not result in a breach or violation of, or a
default under, any agreement by which such Partner or any of such Partners
property is or are bound, or any statute, regulation, order or other law to
which such Partner is subject, (iii) such Partner is a "United States person"
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, and (iv) this
Agreement is binding upon, and enforceable against, such Partner in accordance
with its terms.

 

B. Each Partner that is not an individual represents and warrants to each
other Partner that (i) its execution and delivery of this Agreement and all
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be performed by it have been
duly authorized by all necessary action, including without limitation, that of
its general partner(s), member(s), committee(s), trustee(s),
beneficiaries, directors and/or stockholder(s), as the case may be, as
required, (ii) the consummation of such transactions shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or a default under, its certificate of limited
partnership, partnership agreement, trust agreement, limited liability
company operating agreement, charter or bylaws, as the case may be, any
agreement by which such Partner or any of such Partners properties or any of
its partners, members, beneficiaries, trustees or stockholders, as the case
may be, is or are bound, or any statute, regulation, order or other law to
which such Partner or any of its partners, members, trustees, beneficiaries or
stockholders, as the case may be, is or are subject, (iii) such Partner is
a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code and (iv) this Agreement is binding upon, and enforceable against, such
Partner in accordance with its terms.

 



31 C. Each Partner represents, warrants, and agrees that it has acquired and
continues to hold its interest in the Partnership for its own account for
investment only and not for the purpose of, or with a view toward, the resale
or distribution of all or any part thereof, nor with a view toward selling or
otherwise distributing such interest or any part thereof at any particular
time or under any predetermined circumstances. Each Partner further represents
and warrants that it is a sophisticated investor, able and accustomed to
handling sophisticated financial matters for itself, particularly real estate
investments, and that it has a sufficiently high net worth that it does not
anticipate a need for the funds it has invested in the Partnership in what it
understands to be a highly speculative and illiquid investment. Each Partner
represents, warrants and agrees that such Partner is an "accredited investor"
(as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities
Act), unless receipt of such representation is waived by the General Partner.

D. Each Partner acknowledges that (i) the Partnership Units (and any REIT
Shares that might be exchanged therefor) have not been registered under the
Securities Act and may not be transferred unless they are subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available (it being understood that the Partnership has no intention of
so registering the Partnership Units), (ii) a restrictive legend in the form
set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ D_ shall be placed on the certificates
representing the Partnership Units, and (iii) a notation shall be made in
the appropriate records of the Partnership indicating that the Partnership
Units are subject to restrictions on transfer.

E. Each Limited Partner further represents, warrants, covenants and agrees as
follows:

(1) Except as provided in _Exhibit E_ , at any time such Partner actually or
Constructively Owns a 5% or greater capital interest or profits interest in
the Partnership, it does not and will not, without the prior written consent
of the General Partner, actually own or Constructively Own (a) with respect
to any Tenant that is a corporation, any stock of such Tenant, and (b) with
respect to any Tenant that is not a corporation, any interests in either the
assets or net profits of such Tenant.

 

(2) Except as provided in _Exhibit F_ , at any time such Partner actually or
Constructively Owns a 25% or greater capital interest or profits interest in
the Partnership, it does not, and agrees that it will not without the prior
written consent of the General Partner, actually own or Constructively Own,
any stock in the General Partner, other than any REIT Shares or other
shares of capital stock of the General Partner such Partner may acquire (a)
as a result of an exchange of Tendered Units pursuant to Section 8.6 or (b)
upon the exercise of options granted or delivery of REIT Shares pursuant to
any Stock Plan, in each case subject to the ownership limitations set forth
in the General Partners Charter.

(3) Upon request of the General Partner, it will disclose to the General
Partner the amount of REIT Shares or other shares of capital stock of the
General Partner, or shares of capital stock or other interests in Tenants,
that it actually owns or Constructively Owns.

 



32 (4) It understands that if, for any reason, (a) the representations,
warranties or agreements set forth in _E(1)_ or _(2)_ above are violated, or
(b) the Partnerships actual or Constructive Ownership of REIT Shares or other
shares of capital stock of the General Partner violates the limitations set
forth in the Charter, then (x) some or all of the Redemption rights of the
Partners may become non-exercisable, and (y) some or all of the REIT Shares
owned by the Partners may be automatically transferred to a trust for the
benefit of a charitable beneficiary, as provided in the Charter.

(5) Without the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or
withheld in its sole discretion, no Partner shall take any action that would
cause (i) the Partnership at any time to have more than 100 partners,
including as partners ("flow through partners") those persons indirectly
owning an interest in the Partnership through a partnership, limited liability
company, S corporation or grantor trust (such entity, a "flow through
entity"), but only if substantially all of the value of such
persons interest in the flow through entity is attributable to the flow
through entitys interest (direct or indirect) in the Partnership; or (ii) the
Partnership Interest initially issued to such Partner or its predecessors to
be held by more than seven (7) partners, including as partners any flow
through partners.

F. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.4 shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Partner and the
dissolution and winding-up of the Partnership.

 

G. Each Partner hereby acknowledges that no representations as to potential
profit, cash flows, funds from operations or yield, if any, in respect of the
Partnership or the General Partner have been made by any Partner or any
employee or representative or Affiliate of any Partner, and that projections
and any other information, including, without limitation, financial and
descriptive information and documentation, which may have been in any manner
submitted to such Partner shall not constitute any representation or warranty
of any kind or nature, express or implied.

 

Section 3.5 _Certain ERISA Matters_

 

Each Partner acknowledges that the Partnership is intended to qualify as a
"real estate operating company" (as such term is defined in the Plan Asset
Regulation). The General Partner may structure the investments in,
relationships with and conduct with respect to Properties and any other assets
of the Partnership so that the Partnership will be a "real estate
operating company" (as such term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation).

ARTICLE 4.

 

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Section 4.1  _Capital Contributions of the Partners_

At the time of their respective execution of this Agreement, the Partners
shall make or shall have made Capital Contributions as set forth in _Exhibit
A_ to this Agreement. The Partners shall own Partnership Units of the class or
series and in the amounts set forth in _Exhibit A_ and shall have a Percentage
Interest in the Partnership as set forth in _Exhibit A_ , which Percentage
Interest shall be adjusted in _Exhibit A_ from time to time by the General
Partner to the extent necessary to reflect accurately exchanges, redemptions,
Capital Contributions, the issuance of additional Partnership Units or
similar events having an effect on a Partners

 



33  Percentage Interest. Except as required by law, as otherwise provided in
_Sections 4.3_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ and _10.5_ , or as otherwise agreed to by a
Partner and the Partnership, no Partner shall be required or permitted to
make any additional Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership. Unless
otherwise specified by the General Partner at the time of the creation of any
class of Partnership Interests, the corresponding class or series of capital
stock for any Partnership Units issued shall be REIT Shares.

Section 4.2 _Loans by Third Parties_

 

Subject to _Section 4.3_, the Partnership may incur Debt, or enter into other
similar credit, guarantee, financing or refinancing arrangements for any
purpose (including, without limitation, in connection with any further
acquisition of Properties) with any Person that is not the General Partner
upon such terms as the General Partner determines appropriate; _provided_  
_that_ , the Partnership shall not incur any Debt that is recourse to the
General Partner, except to the extent otherwise agreed to by the General
Partner in its sole discretion.

 

Section 4.3 _Additional Funding and Capital Contributions_

 

A. _General_. The General Partner may, at any time and from time to time
determine that the Partnership requires additional funds (" _Additional
Funds_ ") for the acquisition of additional Properties or for such other
Partnership purposes as the General Partner may determine. Additional Funds
may be raised by the Partnership, at the election of the General Partner, in
any manner provided in, and in accordance with, the terms of this _Section
4.3_. No Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or similar right or
rights to subscribe for or acquire any Partnership Interest, except as
set forth in this _Section 4.3_.

B. _Issuance of Additional Partnership Interests_. The General Partner, in its
sole and absolute discretion, may raise all or any portion of the Additional
Funds by accepting additional Capital Contributions of cash. The General
Partner may also accept additional Capital Contributions of real property or
any other non-cash assets. In connection with any such additional Capital
Contributions (of cash or property), the General Partner is hereby authorized
to cause the Partnership from time to time to issue to Partners (including
the General Partner) or other Persons (including, without limitation, in
connection with the contribution of tangible or intangible property, services,
or other consideration permitted by the Act to the Partnership) additional
Partnership Units or other Partnership Interests, which may be Common Units
or other Partnership Units issued in one or more classes, or one or more
series of any of such classes, with such designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional, conversion, exchange or other special
rights, powers, and duties, including rights, powers, and duties senior to
then existing Limited Partner Interests, all as shall be determined by the
General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion subject to Maryland law,
including without limitation, (i) the allocations of items of Partnership
income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit to such class or series of
Partnership Interests; (ii) the right of each such class or series
of Partnership Interests to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the
rights of each such class or series of Partnership Interests upon dissolution
and liquidation of the Partnership; and (iv) the right to vote, including,
without limitation, the Limited Partner approval rights set forth in _Section
11.2.A_ ; _provided_ , _that_ no such additional Partnership Units or other
Partnership Interests shall be issued to the General Partner unless either (a)
(1) the additional Partnership Interests are issued in connection with the
grant,

 



34  award, or issuance of shares of the General Partner pursuant to _Section
4.3.C_ below, which shares have designations, preferences, and other rights
(except voting rights) such that the economic interests attributable to such
shares are substantially similar to the designations, preferences and other
rights of the additional Partnership Interests issued to the General Partner
in accordance with this _Section 4.3.B_ , and (2) the General Partner shall
make a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in an amount equal to any net
proceeds raised in connection with such issuance, or (b) the additional
Partnership Interests are issued to all Partners holding Partnership
Interests in the same class in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests in such class or (c) the additional Partnership Interests are issued
pursuant to a Stock Plan. The General Partners determination
that consideration is adequate shall be conclusive insofar as the adequacy of
consideration relates to whether the Partnership Interests are validly issued
and paid. In the event that the Partnership issues additional Partnership
Interests pursuant to this _Section 4.3.B_ , the General Partner shall make
such revisions to this Agreement (including but not limited to the revisions
described in _Section 5.4_, _Section 6.2.B_ , and _Section 8.6_) as
it determines are necessary to reflect the issuance of such additional
Partnership Interests.

C. _Issuance of REIT Shares or Other Securities by the General Partner_.
Except as provided in the next following paragraph of this _Section 4.3C_ ,
the General Partner shall not issue any additional REIT Shares, other shares
of capital stock of the General Partner or New Securities (other than REIT
Shares issued pursuant to _Section 8.6_ or such shares, stock or securities
pursuant to a dividend or distribution (including any stock split) to all of
its stockholders or all of its stockholders who hold a particular class of
stock of the General Partner), unless (i) the General Partner shall cause the
Partnership to issue to the General Partner, Partnership Interests or rights,
options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities of
the Partnership having designations, preferences and other rights, all such
that the economic interests thereof are substantially similar to those of the
REIT Shares, other shares of capital stock of the General Partner or New
Securities issued by the General Partner and (ii) the General Partner shall
make a Capital Contribution of any net proceeds from the issuance of such
additional REIT Shares, other shares of capital stock or New Securities, as
the case may be, and from any exercise of the rights contained in such
additional New Securities, as the case may be. Without limiting the foregoing,
the General Partner is expressly authorized to issue REIT Shares, other shares
of capital stock of the General Partner or New Securities for no tangible
value or for less than fair market value, and the General Partner is expressly
authorized to cause the Partnership to issue to the General Partner
corresponding Partnership Interests, so long as (x) the General Partner
concludes in good faith that such issuance of Partnership Interests is in the
interests of the Partnership; and (y) the General Partner contributes all
proceeds, if any, from such issuance and exercise to the Partnership.

 

In connection with the General Partners initial public offering of REIT
Shares, any other issuance of REIT Shares, other capital stock of the General
Partner or New Securities, the General Partner shall contribute to the
Partnership, any net proceeds raised in connection with such issuance;
_provided_ , _that_ the General Partner may use a portion of the net proceeds
from any offering to acquire Partnership Units or other assets ( _provided_
such other assets are contributed to the Partnership pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement); and _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ if the net proceeds
actually received by the General Partner are less than the gross proceeds of
such issuance as a result of any underwriters discount or other expenses paid
or incurred in connection with such issuance then, except to the extent such
net proceeds are used to acquire

 



35  Partnership Units, the General Partner shall be deemed to have made a
Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount equal to the sum of the
net proceeds of such issuance plus the amount of such underwriters discount
and other expenses paid by the General Partner (which discount and expense
shall be treated as an expense for the benefit of the Partnership for purposes
of _Section 7.4_). In the case of issuance of REIT Shares by the General
Partner in any offering, whether registered under the Securities Act or exempt
from such registration, underwritten, offered and sold directly to investors
or through agents or other intermediaries, or otherwise distributed, for
purposes of determining the number of additional Common Units issuable upon a
Capital Contribution funded by the net proceeds thereof consistently with the
immediately preceding sentence, any discount from the then current
market price of REIT Shares shall be disregarded such that an equal number of
Common Units can be issued to the General Partner as the number of REIT Shares
sold by the General Partner in such offering, consistently with the
determination of Partners Percentage Interests as provided in _Section
4.3.D_. In the case of issuances of REIT Shares, other capital stock of the
General Partner or New Securities pursuant to any Stock Plan at a discount
from fair market value or for no value, the amount of such discount
representing compensation to the employee, as determined by the General
Partner, shall be treated as an expense for the benefit of the Partnership for
purposes of _Section 7.4_ and, as a result, the General Partner shall be
deemed to have made a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in an amount
equal to the sum of any net proceeds of such issuance plus the amount of such
expense.

 

D. _Percentage Interest Adjustments in the Case of Capital Contributions for
Partnership Units_. Upon the acceptance of additional Capital Contributions
in exchange for any class or series of Partnership Units, the Percentage
Interest of each Partner in such class or series of Partnership Units shall be
equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (i)
the Deemed Partnership Interest Value of the Partnership Interest of such
Partner in respect of such class or series (computed as of the Business Day
immediately preceding the Adjustment Date) and (ii) the Agreed Value of
additional Capital Contributions, if any, made by such Partner to the
Partnership in such class or series of Partnership Interests as of such
Adjustment Date, and the denominator of which is equal to the sum of (i) the
Deemed Value of the Partnership Interests of such class or series (computed
as of the Business Day immediately preceding the Adjustment Date), _plus_ (ii)
the aggregate Agreed Value of additional Capital Contributions contributed by
all Partners and/or third parties to the Partnership on such Adjustment Date
in such class or series. _Provided_ , _however_ , solely for purposes of
calculating a Partners Percentage Interest pursuant to this _Section 4.3.D_ ,
(i) in the case of cash Capital Contributions by the General Partner funded
by an offering of REIT Shares or other shares of capital stock of the General
Partner and (ii) in the case of the contribution of Properties by the General
Partner which were acquired by the General Partner in exchange for REIT
Shares or other shares of capital stock of the General Partner immediately
prior to such contribution, the General Partner shall be issued a number of
Partnership Units equal and corresponding to the number of such shares issued
by the General Partner in exchange for such cash or Properties, the
Partnership Units held by the other Partners shall not be adjusted, and the
Partners Percentage Interests shall be adjusted accordingly. The General
Partner shall promptly give each Partner written notice of its Percentage
Interest, as adjusted. This _Section 4.3.D_ shall not apply to the issuance of
Profits Interest Units, which shall be governed by _Section 4.5_, and the
General Partner may adjust Percentage Interests in a manner that is different
from the provisions of this _Section 4.3.D_ to the extent it reasonably
determines it is appropriate to do so to reflect the value of the respective
Capital Contributions made to the Partnership and the number of Partnership
Units issued with respect thereto.

 



36 Section 4.4 _Other Contribution Provisions_.

 

In the event that any Partner is admitted to the Partnership and is given (or
is treated as having received) a Capital Account at the time of admission in
exchange for services rendered to the Partnership, such transaction shall be
treated by the Partnership and the affected Partner as if the Partnership had
compensated such Partner in cash, and the Partner had contributed such cash
to the capital of the Partnership. In addition, with the consent of the
General Partner, in its sole discretion, one or more Limited Partners may
enter into agreements with the Partnership, in the form of a guarantee or
contribution agreement, which have the effect of providing a guarantee of
certain obligations of the Partnership.

Section 4.5 _Profit Interest Units_.

 

The General Partner may from time to time issue Profits Interest Units to
Persons who provide services to the Partnership, for such consideration or
for no consideration as the General Partner may determine to be appropriate,
and admit such Persons as Limited Partners. Subject to the following
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and the special provisions of 
_Sections 4.3.D, 6.2.C, 8.7, 8.8,_ _Article 18_ and _Article 19_ , Profits
Interest Units shall be treated as Common Units, with all of the rights,
privileges and obligations attendant thereto. Subject to _Section 18.2.A(4)
and 19.2A(4)_ , for purposes of computing the Partners Percentage Interests,
Profits Interest Units shall be treated as Common Units. In particular, the
Partnership shall maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence between
Profits Interest Units and Common Units for conversion, distribution and other
purposes, including without limitation complying with the following
procedures:

 

A. If an Adjustment Event occurs, then the General Partner shall make a
corresponding adjustment to the Profits Interest Units to maintain a one-for-
one conversion and economic equivalence ratio between Common Units and Profits
Interest Units. The following shall be " _Adjustment Events_ ": (i)
the Partnership makes a distribution on all outstanding Common Units in
Partnership Units, (ii) the Partnership subdivides the outstanding Common
Units into a greater number of units or combines the outstanding Common Units
into a smaller number of units, or (iii) the Partnership issues any
Partnership Units in exchange for its outstanding Common Units by way of a
reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Units. If more than one
Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the Profits Interest Units need be
made only once using a single formula that takes into account each and every
Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously. For the
avoidance of doubt, the following shall not be Adjustment Events: (x) the
issuance of Partnership Units in a financing, reorganization, acquisition or
other similar business transaction, (y) the issuance of Partnership Units
pursuant to any employee benefit or compensation plan or
distribution reinvestment plan, or (z) the issuance of any Partnership Units
to the Company in respect of a Capital Contribution to the Partnership of
proceeds from the sale of securities by the Company. If the Partnership takes
an action affecting the Common Units other than actions specifically
described above as "Adjustment Events" and in the opinion of the General
Partner such action would require an adjustment to the Profits Interest Units
to maintain the one-to-one correspondence described

 



37  above, the General Partner shall have the right to make such adjustment to
the Profits Interest Units, to the extent permitted by law and by any
applicable Stock Plan or other compensatory arrangement or incentive program
pursuant to which Profits Interest Units are issued, in such manner and at
such time as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be
reasonably appropriate under the circumstances. If an adjustment is made to
the Profits Interest Units as herein provided the Partnership shall promptly
file in the books and records of the Partnership an officers certificate
setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring
such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the
correctness of such adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after filing of
such certificate, the Partnership shall mail a notice to each Profits Interest
Unitholder setting forth the adjustment to his or her Profits Interest Units
and the effective date of such adjustment.

B. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, _Article 18_ with respect the Class C Units and _Article 19_ with
respect to Class D Units) or by the General Partner with respect to any
particular class or series of Profits Interest Units, (a) the Profits
Interest Unitholders shall, in respect of each Distribution Payment Date,
when, as and if authorized and declared by the General Partner out of assets
legally available for that purpose, be entitled to receive distributions in
an amount per Profits Interest Unit equal to the distributions per Common
Unit, paid to holders of record on the same record date established by the
General Partner with respect to such Distribution Payment Date; (b)
references to additional Partnership Interests in _Section 5.4_ shall be
deemed to include Profits Interest Units issued during a Distribution Period
and such _Section 5.4_ shall apply in full to Profits Interest Units; (c)
during any Distribution Period, so long as any Profits Interest Units are
outstanding, no distributions (whether in cash or in kind) shall be
authorized, declared or paid on Common Units, unless equal distributions have
been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid on the Profits
Interest Units for such Distribution Period, (d) the Profits Interest Units
shall rank _pari passu_ with the Common Units as to the payment of regular and
special periodic or other distributions and distribution of assets, and (e)
any class or series of Partnership Units or Partnership Interests which by its
terms specifies that it shall rank junior to, on a parity with, or senior to
the Common Units with respect to distributions shall also rank junior to, on
a parity with, or senior to, as the case may be, the Profits Interest Units.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.5.B_ , proceeds
from a Liquidating Event shall be distributed to Holders of Partnership Units
as set forth in _Sections 5.3_ and _13.2_. Subject to the terms of any Vesting
Agreement, a Profits Interest Unitholder shall be entitled to transfer his or
her Profits Interest Units to the same extent, and subject to the same
restrictions as holders of Common Units are entitled to transfer their Common
Units pursuant to _Article 11_.

C. Profits Interest Units shall be subject to the following special
provisions:

(a) _Vesting Agreements_. Profits Interest Units may, in the sole discretion
of the General Partner, be issued subject to vesting, forfeiture and
additional restrictions on transfer pursuant to the terms of a Vesting
Agreement. The terms of any Vesting Agreement may be modified by the General
Partner from time to time in its sole discretion, subject to any restrictions
on amendment imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement or by the Plan, if
applicable. Profits Interest Units that were fully vested when issued or that
have vested under the terms of a Vesting Agreement are referred to as "
_Vested Profits Interest Units_ "; all other Profits Interest Units shall be
treated as " _Unvested Profits Interest Units_."

 



38 (b) _Forfeiture_. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement or in
any applicable Stock Plan or other compensatory arrangement or incentive
program pursuant to which Profits Interest Units are issued, upon the
occurrence of any event specified in such Vesting Agreement, Stock Plan,
arrangement or program as resulting in either the right of the Partnership or
the General Partner to repurchase Profits Interest Units at a specified
purchase price or some other forfeiture of any Profits Interest Units, then if
the Partnership or the General Partner exercises such right to repurchase or
forfeiture or upon the occurrence of the event causing forfeiture in
accordance with the applicable Vesting Agreement, Stock Plan, arrangement or
program, then the relevant Profits Interest Units shall immediately, and
without any further action, be treated as cancelled and no longer outstanding
for any purpose. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Vesting
Agreement, Stock Plan, arrangement or program, no consideration or other
payment shall be due with respect to any Profits Interest Units that have
been forfeited, other than any distributions declared with respect to a
Partnership Record Date and with respect to such units, prior to the effective
date of the forfeiture. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any
agreement relating to the grant of Profits Interest Units (including each
Class C Units Agreement and Class D Units Agreement), in connection with any
repurchase or forfeiture of such units, the balance of the portion of the
Capital Account of the Profits Interest Unitholder that is attributable to all
of his or her Profits Interest Units shall be reduced by the amount, if any,
by which it exceeds the target balance contemplated by _Section 6.2.C_ ,
calculated with respect to the Profits Interest Unitholders remaining
Profits Interest Units, if any.

(c) _Allocations_. Profits Interest Unitholders shall be entitled to certain
special allocations of gain under _Section 6.2.C and of income under Article
19_.

(d)  _Redemption_. The Redemption Right provided to Limited Partners under
_Section 8.6_ shall not apply with respect to Profits Interest Units unless
and until they are converted to Common Units as provided in clause (f) below
and  _Section 8.7_.

(e) _Legend_. Any certificate evidencing an Profits Interest Unit shall bear
an appropriate legend indicating that additional terms, conditions and
restrictions on transfer, including without limitation any Vesting Agreement,
apply to the Profits Interest Unit.

 

(f) _Conversion to Common Units_. Vested Profits Interest Units are eligible
to be converted into Common Units under  _Section 8.7_.

(g) _Voting_. Profits Interest Units shall have the voting rights provided in
_Section 8.8_.

 

D. Each Partner authorizes the General Partner to elect to apply the safe
harbor (the " _Section_ __ _ 83 Safe Harbor_") set forth in proposed
Regulations Section 1.83-3(l) and proposed IRS Revenue Procedure published in
Notice 2005-43 (together, the " _Proposed Section_ __ _ 83 Safe Harbor
Regulation_") (under which the fair market value of a Partnership Interest
that is transferred in connection with the performance of services is treated
as being equal to the liquidation value of the interest) if such Proposed
Section 83 Safe Harbor Regulation or similar Regulations are promulgated as a
final or temporary Regulations. If the General Partner determines that the
Partnership should make such election, the General Partner is hereby

 



39  authorized to amend this Agreement without the consent of any other Partner

services while such election remains in effect and (iii) the Partnership and
each of its Partners will take all actions necessary, including providing the

ARTICLE 5.

DISTRIBUTIONS 

Section 5.1 _Requirement and Characterization of_ __ _ Distributions_

 

The General Partner shall cause the Partnership to distribute quarterly all,
or such portion as the General Partner may in its discretion determine, of
Available Cash generated by the Partnership to the Partners who are Partners
on the applicable Partnership Record Date with respect to such distribution,
(1) first, with respect to any class or series of Partnership Interests
that are entitled to any preference in distributions, in accordance with the
rights of such class or series of Partnership Interests (and within such class
or series, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests on
the applicable Partnership Record Date), and (2) second, with respect to any
class or series of Partnership Interests that are not entitled to any
preference in distributions, pro rata to each such class or series in
accordance with the terms of such class or series to the Partners who are
Partners of such class or series on the Partnership Record Date with respect
to such distribution (and within each such class or series, pro rata in
proportion to the respective Percentage Interests on such Partnership Record
Date), subject to any limitations on distributions with respect to any class
of Profits Interest Units. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein or
in an agreement, if any, entered into in connection with the creation of a new
class or series of Partnership Interests created in accordance with _Article

to any other Partnership Interest. The General Partner shall take such
reasonable efforts, as determined by it in its sole and absolute

 



40  discretion and consistent with its qualification as a REIT, to cause the
Partnership to distribute sufficient amounts to enable the General Partner,
for so long as the General Partner has determined to qualify as a REIT, to
pay stockholder dividends that will (a) satisfy the requirements for
qualifying as a REIT under the Code and Regulations (" _REIT Requirements_ "),
and (b) except to the extent otherwise determined by the General Partner,
avoid the imposition of any federal income or excise tax liability on the
General Partner, except to the extent that a distribution pursuant to clause
(b) would prevent the Partnership from making a distribution to the Holders
of Series C Preferred Units in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 21.2_, Series G
Preferred Units in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 22.2,_ Series H Preferred
Units in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 23.2_ and Series I Preferred Units

Except as expressly provided herein, no right is given to any Partner to
demand and receive property other than cash. The General Partner may
determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, to make a distribution in-kind
to the Partners of Partnership assets, and such assets shall be distributed in
such a fashion as to ensure that the fair market value is distributed and
allocated in accordance with _Articles_ __ _ 5_, _6_ and _10_.

 

Section 5.3 _Distributions Upon Liquidation_

 

Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, proceeds from a Liquidating Event shall
be distributed to the Partners in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 13.2_.

Interests_

 

In the event that the Partnership issues additional Partnership Interests to
the General Partner or any Additional Limited Partner pursuant to  _Section
4.3.B_ , _4.3.C_ or _4.5_ , the General Partner shall make such revisions to
this _Article 5_ as it determines are necessary to reflect the issuance of
such additional Partnership Interests. In the absence of any agreement to the
contrary, an Additional Limited Partner shall be entitled to the distributions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ (without regard to this _Section_ __ _
5.4_) with respect to the period during which the closing of its contribution
to the Partnership occurs, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days from and after the date of such closing through the end of
the applicable period, and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in such period.

ARTICLE 6.

 

ALLOCATIONS

Section 6.1 _Timing and Amount of Allocations of Net Income and Net Loss_

Net Income and Net Loss of the Partnership shall be determined and allocated
with respect to each Partnership Year of the Partnership as of the end of
each such year. Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 6_ , an
allocation to a Partner of a share of Net Income or Net Loss shall be treated
as an allocation of the same share of each item of income, gain, loss or
deduction that is taken into account in computing Net Income or Net Loss.

 



41 Section 6.2 _General Allocations_

 

Except as otherwise provided in this _Article 6_ , Net Income and Net Loss
allocable with respect to a class of Partnership Interests shall be allocated
to each of the Holders holding such class of Partnership Interests in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interest of such class.

 

A. _Allocation of_ Net Income _and_ Net Losses.

 

(1) _Net Income_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.3_, Net Income
for any Partnership Year shall be allocated to the Partners in the following
manner and order of priority:

(a) _First_ , to the General Partner in an amount equal to the remainder,
if any, of the cumulative Net Losses allocated to the General Partner

cumulative Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this
_Section 6.2.A.(1)(a_ ) for all prior Partnership Years;

any, of the cumulative Net Losses allocated to each such Limited Partner

_Section 6.2.A.(1)(b_ ) for all prior Partnership Years;

(c) _Third_ , to the General Partner in an amount equal to the remainder, if
any, of the cumulative Net Losses allocated to the General Partner pursuant
to _Section 6.2.A.2(b_ ) for all prior Partnership Years _minus_ the
cumulative Net Income allocated to such Partner pursuant to this _Section
6.2.A.1(c_ ) for all prior Partnership Years;

(d) _Fourth_ , to the General Partner in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
excess of the cumulative Series G Priority Return on the Series G Preferred
Units to the last day of the current Partnership Year or to the date of
redemption or conversion of the Series G Preferred Units, to the extent such
Series G Preferred Units are redeemed or converted during such year over the
cumulative Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this clause
( _i_ ) of this _Section 6.2.A.1(d_ ) for all prior Partnership Years, (ii)
the excess of the cumulative Series H Priority Return on the Series H
Preferred Units to the last day of the current Partnership Year or to the date
of redemption or conversion of the Series H Preferred Units, to the extent
such Series H Preferred Units are redeemed or converted during such year over
the cumulative Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this
clause ( _ii_ ) of this _Section 6.2.A.1(d_ ) for all prior Partnership Years,
( _iii_ ) the excess of the sum of (x) the cumulative Series I Priority

or converted during such year and (y) the Series I Preferential Distribution
Amount over the cumulative Net Income allocated to the General Partner
pursuant to this clause ( _iii_ ) of this _Section 6.2.A.1_ (d) for all
prior Partnership Years, (iv) the excess of the cumulative Series C Priority
Return on the Series C Preferred Units to the last day of the current
Partnership Year or to the date of redemption or conversion of the Series C

converted during such year over the

 



42  cumulative Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this
clause _(iv)_ of this _Section 6.2.A.1(d)_ for all prior Partnership Years,
_provided however_ that notwithstanding clauses (i)-(iv) of this _Section
6.2.A.1(d)_ , in connection with any conversion of any such Partnership Units,
the General Partner shall be permitted to make allocations of income or loss
with respect to such Partnership Units and the Common Units issued upon such
conversion that are consistent with the distributions payable with respect to
such Partnership Units and Common Units;

 

(e) _Fifth,_ to the General Partner and the Limited Partners in an amount
equal to the remainder, if any, of the cumulative Net Losses allocated to
each such Partner pursuant to _Section 6.2.A.2(a)_ for all prior Partnership
Years _minus_ the cumulative Net Income allocated to each Partner pursuant to
this _Section 6.2.A.(1)(e)_ for all prior Partnership Years; and 

(f) _Sixth_ , to each of the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests in the Common-Equivalent Units, subject to any
limitations on allocations with respect to any class of Profits Interest
Units.

To the extent the allocations of Net Income set forth above in any paragraph
of this _Section 6.2.A.(1)_ are not sufficient to entirely satisfy the
allocation set forth in such paragraph, such allocation shall be made in
proportion to the total amount that would have been allocated pursuant to
such paragraph without regard to such shortfall.

(2) _Net Losses_. Except as otherwise provided in  _Section 6.3_, Net Losses
for any Partnership Year shall be allocated to the Partners in the following
manner and order of priority:

 

(a) _First_ , to the General Partner and the Limited Partners in accordance
with their respective Percentage Interests in the Common-Equivalent Units (to
the extent consistent with this _Section 6.2.A(2)(a))_ until the Adjusted
Capital Account Balance (ignoring for this purpose any amounts a Partner is
obligated to contribute to the capital of the Partnership or is deemed
obligated to contribute pursuant to Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c)(2) and ignoring the General Partners Series C Preferred
Capital, Series G Preferred Capital, Series H Preferred Capital and Series I
Preferred Capital) of each such Partner is zero;

(b) _Second_ , to the General Partner (ignoring for this purpose any amounts
the General Partner is obligated to contribute to the capital of the
Partnership or is deemed obligated to contribute pursuant to Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c)(2)), until the Adjusted Capital Account (as so
modified) of the General Partner is zero;

(c) _Third,_ to the Limited Partners to the extent of, and in proportion to,
the positive balance (if any) in their Adjusted Capital Accounts; and

(d) _Fourth,_ to the General Partner.

 

B. _Allocations to Reflect Issuance of Additional Partnership Interests_. In
the event that the Partnership issues additional Partnership Interests to the
General Partner, a Limited Partner or any Additional Limited Partner pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 4.3_, the General Partner shall make such revisions to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ as it determines are necessary to reflect the terms of
the issuance of such additional Partnership Interests, including making
preferential allocations to certain classes of Partnership Interests, subject
to the terms of the Series C Preferred Units, the Series G Preferred Units,
the Series H Preferred Units and the Series I Preferred Units, in accordance
with any method selected by the General Partner.

 



43 C. _Special Allocation of Gain or Loss to Profits Interest Unitholders_.

 

Notwithstanding the allocations set forth in _Section 6.2.A(1)_ above, any net
capital gains or net capital losses realized in connection with the actual or
hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, including but not limited to net capital gain treated as realized
in connection with an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value of Partnership
assets as set forth in the definition of such term, shall first be allocated
to the Profits Interest Unitholders until the Economic Capital Account
Balances of such Limited Partners, to the extent attributable to their
ownership of Profits Interest Units, are equal to (i) the Common Unit
Economic Balance, multiplied by (ii) the number of their Profits Interest
Units. For this purpose, the "Economic Capital Account Balances" of the
Profits Interest Unitholders will be equal to their Capital Account balances,
plus the amount of their shares of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership
Minimum Gain, in each case to the extent attributable to their ownership of
Profits Interest Units. Similarly, the " _Common Unit Economic Balance_ "
shall mean (i) the Capital Account balance of the Company, plus the amount of
the Companys share of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain,
in either case to the extent attributable to the Companys ownership of
Common Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account
all allocations through the date on which any allocation is made under this
_Section 6.2.C_ , divided by (ii) the number of the Companys Common Units.
Any such allocations shall be made among the Profits Interest Unitholders in
proportion to the amounts required to be allocated to each under this _Section
6.2.C_. The parties agree that the intent of this _Section 6.2.C_ is to
make the Capital Account balances of the Profits Interest Unitholders with
respect to their Profits Interest Units economically equivalent to the Capital
Account balance of the Company with respect to its Common Units.

 

D. _Allocations in Connection with a Liquidating Event_. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 6.3, the allocations of Net Income and Net Loss set forth
in the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2 shall be adjusted to the
extent necessary so as to result in the Capital Account balance of each
Partner being such that distributions to the Partners pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 13.2_ upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event shall be made first to
the General Partner in an amount equal to the sum of the Series C Preferred
Capital, the Series G Preferred Capital, the Series H Preferred Capital and
the Series I Preferred Capital, and thereafter to Holders of Common-Equivalent
Units in accordance with their Percentage Interests in such Units.

 

Section 6.3 _Additional Allocation Provisions_

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Article 6_ :

 

A. Regulatory Allocations.

 



44 (i) _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided in Regulations
Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.2_, or any
other provision of this _Article 6_ , if there is a net decrease in
Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership Year, each Holder shall be
specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and,
if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Holders share of
the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined under
Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence
shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated
to each Holder pursuant thereto. The items to be allocated shall be
determined in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and
1.704-2(j)(2). This _Section 6.3.A(i)_ is intended to qualify as a "minimum
gain chargeback" within the meaning of Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) which
shall be controlling in the event of a conflict between such Regulation and
this _Section 6.3.A(i)_.

 

(ii) _Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided in
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), and notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 6.2_, or any other provision of this _Article 6_ (except _Section
6.3.A(i))_ , if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable
to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Partnership Year, each Holder who has
a share of the Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse
Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall
be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year
(and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Holders
share of the net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such
Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in
proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Holder
pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in
accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This
_Section 6.3.A(ii)_ is intended to qualify as a "chargeback of partner
nonrecourse debt minimum gain" within the meaning of Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i) which shall be controlling in the event of a conflict
between such Regulation and this _Section 6.3.A(ii)_.

 

(iii) _Nonrecourse Deductions and Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Any
Nonrecourse Deductions for any Partnership Year shall be specially allocated
to the Holders in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests in
Common-Equivalent Units. Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
Partnership Year shall be specially allocated to the Holder(s) who bears the
economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which
such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable, in accordance with
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i).

(iv) _Qualified Income Offset_. If any Holder unexpectedly receives
an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of Partnership income and gain
shall be allocated, in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), to the Holder in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by such Regulations, the Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit of the Holder as quickly as possible provided that an
allocation pursuant to this _Section 6.3.A(iv)_ shall be made if and only to
the extent that such Holder would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
after all other allocations provided in this _Article 6_ have been
tentatively made as if this _Section 6.3.A(iv)_ were not in this Agreement.
It is intended that this _Section 6.3.A(iv)_ qualify and be construed as a
"qualified income offset" within the meaning of
Regulations 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), which shall be controlling in the event of
a conflict between such Regulations and this _Section 6.3.A(iv)_.

 



45 (v) _Gross Income Allocation_. In the event any Holder has a deficit Capital
Account at the end of any Partnership Year which is in excess of the sum of
(1) the amount (if any) such Holder is obligated to restore to the
Partnership, and (2) the amount such Holder is deemed to be obligated to
restore pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) or the
penultimate sentences of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5),
each such Holder shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, _provided_ , _that_
an allocation pursuant to this _Section 6.3.A(v)_ shall be made if and only to
the extent that such Holder would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of
such sum after all other allocations provided in this _Article 6_ have been
tentatively made as if this _Section 6.3.A(v)_ and _Section 6.3.A(iv)_ were
not in this Agreement.

(vi) _Limitation on Allocation of Net Loss_. To the extent any allocation of
Net Loss would cause or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as to
any Holder, such allocation of Net Loss shall be reallocated among the other
Holders in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests in Common-
Equivalent Units subject to the limitations of this _Section 6.3.A(vi)_.

(vii) _Section 754 Adjustment_. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted
tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code
Section 743(b) is required, pursuant to Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be
taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a
distribution to a Holder in complete liquidation of his interest in the
Partnership, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss
shall be specially allocated to the Holders in accordance with their
interests in the Partnership in the event that Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Holders to whom such distribution
was made in the event that Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4)
applies.

(viii) _Noncompensatory Options_. If, as a result of an exercise of a
Noncompensatory Option to acquire an interest in the Partnership, a Capital
Account reallocation is required under Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the Partnership shall make corrective allocations
pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

(ix) _Curative Allocation_. The allocations set forth in _Sections 6.3.A(i)_
, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , and _(vii)_ (the " _Regulatory
Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with certain regulatory requirements,
including the requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2.
Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ (but subject to
Section 6.2.D), the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in
allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Holders
so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such allocations of other
items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Holder shall be equal to the net
amount that would have been allocated to each such Holder if the Regulatory
Allocations had not occurred.

 



46 B. For purposes of determining a Holders proportional share of the "excess
nonrecourse liabilities" of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations
Section 1.752-3(a)(3), each Holders interest in Partnership profits shall be
such Holders Percentage Interest in Common-Equivalent Units.

Section 6.4 _Tax Allocations_

 

A. _In General_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.4_, for
income tax purposes each item of income, gain, loss and deduction
(collectively, " _Tax Items_ ") shall be allocated among the Holders in the
same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction
is allocated pursuant to _Sections 6.2_ and _6.3_. 

B. _Allocations Respecting Section 704(c) Revaluations_. Notwithstanding
_Section 6.4.A_ , Tax Items with respect to Partnership property that is
contributed to the Partnership by a Partner shall be shared among the Holders
for income tax purposes pursuant to Regulations promulgated under Section
704(c) of the Code, so as to take into account the variation, if any,
between the basis of the property to the Partnership and its initial Gross
Asset Value. With respect to Partnership property that is contributed to the
Partnership in connection with the General Partners initial public offering
or pursuant to the Partnerships exercise of rights under any Option
Agreement or ROFO Agreement, such variation between basis and initial Gross
Asset Value shall be taken into account under the "traditional method" as
described in Regulations Section 1.704-3(b). With respect to other Properties
contributed to the Partnership, the Partnership shall account for such
variation under any method consistent with Section 704(c) of the Code and the
applicable regulations as chosen by the General Partner. In the event the
Gross Asset Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to
subparagraph (b) of the definition of Gross Asset Value (provided in _Article
1_), subsequent allocations of Tax Items with respect to such asset shall
take account of the variation, if any, between the adjusted basis of such
asset and its Gross Asset Value in the same manner as under Section 704(c) of
the Code and the applicable regulations consistent with the requirements of
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) using any method approved under
Section 704(c) of the Code and the applicable regulations as chosen by the
General Partner,  _provided_ , _however_ , that the "traditional method" as
described in Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) shall be used with respect to
Partnership property that is contributed to the Partnership in connection
with the General Partners initial public offering or pursuant to the
Partnerships exercise of rights under any Option Agreement or ROFO Agreement.

 

Section 6.5 _Special Allocations_

A. Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 6.2.A but subject to the other
provisions of this Article 6, if the Partnership has positive Adjusted Net
Income for a fiscal year, such Adjusted Net Income shall first be allocated to
the General Partner under Section 6.2.A(1)(d) for such fiscal year, with the
remaining items of Net Income or Net Loss allocated to the Partners pursuant
to Section 6.2.A.

 

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2.A, but subject to Sections
6.3 and 6.5.A, in the event Net Income, Net Loss or items thereof are being
allocated to a Partner to offset prior Net Loss, Net Income or items thereof
which have been allocated to such Partner, the General Partner shall attempt
to allocate such offsetting Net Income, Net Loss or items thereof which are of
the same or similar character (including without limitation Section 704(b)
book items versus tax items) to the original allocations with respect to such
Partner.

 



47 ARTICLE 7.

other Person in which it has an equity investment from time to time);

fail to qualify as a REIT;

of, or guarantying the obligations of any such Persons);

 

(13) subject to the other provisions in this Agreement, the determination of
the fair market value of any Partnership property distributed in kind using
such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt, _provided_ , _that_ such

the Partners as the same are adjusted from time to time to the extent
necessary to reflect redemptions, Capital Contributions, the issuance of
Partnership Units, the admission of any Additional Limited Partner or any
Substituted Limited Partner or otherwise, which amendment and restatement,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shall not be
deemed an amendment to this Agreement, as long as the matter or event being
reflected in _Exhibit A_ hereto otherwise is authorized by this Agreement;

vote of the Partners, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement
(except as provided in  _Section 7.3_ or _11.2_ ), the Act or any applicable
law, rule or regulation to the fullest extent permitted under the Act or other
applicable law, rule or regulation. The execution, delivery or performance by
the General Partner or the Partnership of any agreement authorized or
permitted under this Agreement shall not constitute a breach by the General
Partner of any duty that the General Partner may owe the Partnership or the
Limited Partners or any other Persons under this Agreement or of any duty
stated or implied by law or equity.

C. At all times from and after the date hereof, the General Partner may
cause the Partnership to obtain and maintain (i) casualty, liability and
other insurance on the Properties of the Partnership and (ii) liability
insurance for the benefit of any or all Indemnitees.

 

D. At all times from and after the date hereof, the General Partner may cause
the Partnership to establish and maintain working capital and other reserves
in such amounts as the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion,
deems appropriate and reasonable from time to time.

 

E. In exercising its authority under this Agreement, the General Partner may,
but shall be under no obligation to, take into account the tax consequences
to any Partner (including the General Partner) of any action taken (or not
taken) by the General Partner. The General Partner and the Partnership shall
not have liability to a Partner under this Agreement as a result of an income
tax liability incurred by such Limited Partner as a result of an action (or
inaction) by the General Partner pursuant to its authority under this
Agreement.

 



51 F. Except as otherwise provided herein, to the extent the duties of the
General Partner require expenditures of funds to be paid to third parties,
the General Partner shall not have any obligations hereunder except to the
extent that Partnership funds are reasonably available to it for the
performance of such duties, and nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
authorize or require the General Partner, in its capacity as such, to expend
its individual funds for payment to third parties or to undertake any
individual liability or obligation on behalf of the Partnership.

 

Section 7.2 _Certificate of Limited Partnership_

 

To the extent that such action is determined by the General Partner to be
reasonable and necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file
amendments to and restatements of the Certificate and do all the things to
maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership in which
the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of
Maryland and to maintain the Partnerships qualification to do business as a
foreign limited partnership in each other state, the District of Columbia or
other jurisdiction, in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
property. Subject to the terms of _Section 8.5.A(4)_ , the General Partner
shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of
the Certificate or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner. The General
Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other
certificates or documents as may be reasonable and necessary or appropriate
for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited
partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited
liability) in the State of Maryland, any other state, or the District of
Columbia or other jurisdiction, in which the Partnership may elect to do
business or own property.

 

Section 7.3 _Restrictions on General Partner s Authority_

 

A. The General Partner may not take any action in contravention of an express
prohibition or limitation of this Agreement without the written Consent of
the Limited Partners and may not (i) perform any act that would subject a
Limited Partner to liability as a general partner in any jurisdiction or any
liability not contemplated herein or under the Act; or (ii) enter into
any contract, mortgage, loan or other agreement that prohibits or restricts,
or has the effect of prohibiting or restricting, the ability of a Limited
Partner to exercise its rights to a Redemption as provided in Section 8.6,
except in each case with the written consent of such Limited Partner.

B. The General Partner shall not, without the prior Consent of the Limited
Partners, or except as provided in Section 7.3.C, amend, modify or terminate
this Agreement.

C. Notwithstanding Section 7.3.B, the General Partner shall have the
exclusive power to amend this Agreement as may be required to facilitate or
implement any of the following purposes:

(1) to add to the obligations of the General Partner or surrender any right
or power granted to the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General
Partner for the benefit of the Limited Partners;

 

(2) to reflect the issuance of additional Partnership Interests pursuant to
_Sections 4.3_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ , _5.4_ and  _6.2.B_ or the admission,
substitution, termination, or withdrawal of Partners in accordance with this
Agreement (which may be effected through the replacement of _Exhibit A_ with
an amended _Exhibit A_ );

 



52 (3) to set forth or amend the designations, rights, powers, duties, and
preferences of the holders of any additional Partnership Interests issued
pursuant to _Article 4_ ;

(4) to reflect a change that is of an inconsequential nature and does not
adversely affect the Limited Partners in any material respect, or to cure any
ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision in this Agreement not
inconsistent with law or with other provisions, or make other changes with
respect to matters arising under this Agreement that will not be inconsistent
with law or with the provisions of this Agreement;

 

(5) to satisfy any requirements, conditions, or guidelines contained in any
order, directive, opinion, ruling or regulation of a federal or state agency
or contained in federal or state law;

(6) to reflect such changes as are reasonably necessary for the General
Partner to maintain its status as a REIT, including changes which may be
necessitated due to a change in applicable law (or an authoritative
interpretation thereof) or a ruling of the IRS; and

 

(7) to modify, as set forth in the definition of " _Capital Account_ ," the
manner in which Capital Accounts are computed.

 

The General Partner will provide notice to the Limited Partners when any
action under this _Section 7.3.C_ is taken.

 

D. Notwithstanding _Sections 7.3.B_ and _7.3.C_ , this Agreement shall not be
amended with respect to any Partner adversely affected, and no action may be
taken by the General Partner, without the Consent of such Partner adversely
affected if such amendment or action would (i) convert a Limited Partners
interest in the Partnership into a general partners interest (except as the
result of the General Partner acquiring such interest), (ii) modify the
limited liability of a Limited Partner, (iii) alter rights of the Partner to
receive distributions pursuant to _Article 5_ , _Section 13.2.A(4)_ ,
_Article 21_ , _Article 22_ , _Article 23_ or _Article 24_ or the allocations
specified in Article 6 (except as permitted pursuant to _Sections 4.3_ , _4.4_
, _4.5_ , _5.4_ , _6.2.B_ and  _Section 7.3.C(3)_ ), (iv) adversely alter or
modify the rights to a Redemption or the REIT Shares Amount as set forth in
Section 8.6, and related definitions hereof, (v) alter the protections of the
Limited Partners as set forth in _Section 11.2.B_ or (vi) amend this _Section
7.3.D_. Further, no amendment may alter the restrictions on the General
Partners authority set forth elsewhere in this _Section 7.3_ without the
Consent specified in such section. This _Section 7.3D_ does not require
unanimous consent of all Partners adversely affected unless the amendment is
to be effective against all partners adversely affected.

 

Section 7.4 _Reimbursement of the General Partner_

 

A. Except as provided in this _Section 7.4_ and elsewhere in this Agreement
(including the provisions of _Articles 5_ and  _6_ regarding distributions,
payments and allocations to which it may be entitled), the General Partner
shall not be compensated for its services as general partner of the
Partnership.

 



53 B. The Partnership shall be responsible for and shall pay all expenses
relating to the Partnerships and the General Partners organization, the
ownership of its assets and its operations. The General Partner is hereby
authorized to cause the Partnership to pay compensation for accounting,
administrative, legal, technical, management and other services rendered to
the Partnership. Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, the General
Partner and its Affiliates shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such
other basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole and absolute
discretion, for all expenses that the General Partner and its Affiliates incur
relating to the ownership and operation of, or for the benefit of, the
Partnership (including, without limitation, administrative expenses); 
_provided_ , _that_ the amount of any such reimbursement shall be reduced by
any interest earned by the General Partner with respect to bank accounts or
other instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the Partnership. The
Partners acknowledge that all such expenses of the General Partner are deemed
to be for the benefit of the Partnership. Such reimbursement shall be in
addition to any reimbursement made as a result of indemnification pursuant to
_Section 7.7_. In the event that certain expenses are incurred for the
benefit of the Partnership and other entities (including the General Partner),
such expenses will be allocated to the Partnership and such other entities in
such a manner as the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion
deems fair and reasonable. All payments and reimbursements hereunder shall be
characterized for federal income tax purposes as expenses of the Partnership
incurred on its behalf, and not as expenses of the General Partner.

C. If the General Partner shall elect to purchase from its stockholders REIT
Shares for the purpose of delivering such REIT Shares to satisfy an
obligation under any dividend reinvestment program adopted by the General
Partner, any employee stock purchase plan adopted by the General Partner, or
any similar obligation or arrangement undertaken by the General Partner
in the future or for the purpose of retiring such REIT Shares, the purchase
price paid by the General Partner for such REIT Shares and any other expenses
incurred by the General Partner in connection with such purchase shall be
considered expenses of the Partnership and shall be advanced by the
Partnership to the General Partner or reimbursed by the Partnership to the
General Partner, subject to the condition that: (i) if such REIT Shares
subsequently are sold by the General Partner, the General Partner shall pay
to the Partnership any proceeds received by the General Partner for such REIT
Shares (which sales proceeds shall include the amount of dividends reinvested
under any dividend reinvestment or similar program;  _provided_ , _that_ a
transfer of REIT Shares for Common Units pursuant to _Section 8.6_ would not
be considered a sale for such purposes); and (ii) if such REIT Shares are not
retransferred by the General Partner within thirty (30) days after the
purchase thereof, or the General Partner otherwise determines not to
retransfer such REIT Shares, the General Partner, shall cause the Partnership
to redeem a number of Common Units held by the General Partner equal to the
number of such REIT Shares, as adjusted (x) pursuant to Section 7.5 (in the
event the General Partner acquires material assets, other than on behalf of
the Partnership) and (y) for stock dividends and distributions, stock splits
and subdivisions, reverse stock splits and combinations, distributions of
rights, warrants or options, and distributions of evidences of indebtedness or
assets relating to assets not received by the General Partner pursuant to a
_pro_   _rata_ distribution by the Partnership (in which case such
advancement or reimbursement of expenses shall be treated as having been made
as a distribution in redemption of such number of Common Units held by the
General Partner).

 



54 D. As set forth in _Section 4.3_, the General Partner shall be treated as
having made a Capital Contribution in the amount of all expenses that it
incurs relating to the General Partners offering of REIT Shares, other shares
of capital stock of the General Partner or New Securities.

 

E. If and to the extent any reimbursements to the General Partner pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_ constitute gross income of the General Partner (as
opposed to the repayment of advances made by the General Partner on behalf of
the Partnership), such amounts shall constitute guaranteed payments within the
meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated
consistently therewith by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be
treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Partners Capital
Accounts.

 

Section 7.5 _Outside Activities of the General Partner_

 

A. Except in connection with a transaction authorized in _Section 11.2_,
without the Consent of the Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not,
directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any business, other than in
connection with the ownership, acquisition and disposition of Partnership
Interests as a General Partner and the management of the business of
the Partnership, its operation as a public reporting company with a class (or
classes) of securities registered under the Exchange Act, its operation as a
REIT and such activities as are incidental to the same. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Section 7.5, without the Consent of the Limited
Partners, the General Partner shall not, directly or indirectly, participate
in or otherwise acquire any interest in any real or personal property, except
its General Partner Interest, its minority interest in any Subsidiary
Partnership(s) that the General Partner holds in order to maintain such
Subsidiary Partnerships status as a partnership, and such bank accounts,
similar instruments or other short-term investments as it deems necessary to
carry out its responsibilities contemplated under this Agreement and the
Charter. In the event the General Partner desires to contribute cash to any
Subsidiary Partnership to acquire or maintain an interest of 1% or less in
the capital of such partnership, the General Partner may acquire or maintain
an interest of 1% or less in the capital of such partnership, and the General
Partner may acquire such cash from the Partnership as a loan or in exchange
for a reduction in the General Partners Partnership Units, in an amount
equal to the amount of such cash divided by the Fair Market Value of a REIT
Share on the day such cash is received by the General Partner. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the General Partner may acquire Properties or other assets in
exchange for REIT Shares or cash, to the extent such Properties or other
assets are contributed by the General Partner to the Partnership promptly, but
in no case more than six months following such acquisition, pursuant to the
terms described in _Section 4.3.D_. Any Limited Partner Interests acquired by
the General Partner, whether pursuant to exercise by a Limited Partner of its
right of Redemption, or otherwise, shall be automatically converted into a
General Partner Interest comprised of an identical number of Partnership Units
with the same rights, priorities and preferences as the class or series so
acquired. The General Partner may also own one-hundred percent (100%) of the
stock or interests of one or more Qualified REIT Subsidiaries or limited
liability companies, respectively, _provided_ _that_ any such entity shall be
subject to the limitations of this _Section 7.5.A_. If, at any time, the
General Partner acquires material assets (other than Partnership Interests or
other assets on behalf of the Partnership), the definition of " _REIT Shares
Amount_ " and the definition of "Deemed Value of the Partnership Interests"
shall be adjusted, as reasonably determined by the General Partner, to reflect
the relative Fair Market Value of a share of capital stock of the General
Partner relative to the Deemed Partnership Interest Value of the related
Partnership Unit. The General Partners

 



55  General Partner Interest in the Partnership, its minority interest in any
Subsidiary Partnership(s) (held directly or indirectly through a Qualified
REIT Subsidiary) that the General Partner holds in order to maintain such
Subsidiary Partnerships status as a partnership, and interests in such short-
term liquid investments, bank accounts or similar instruments as the General
Partner deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities contemplated under
this Agreement and the Charter are interests which the General Partner is
permitted to acquire and hold for purposes of this _Section 7.5.A_.

 

B. In the event the General Partner exercises its rights under the Charter to
purchase REIT Shares, other capital stock of the General Partner or New
Securities, as the case may be, then the General Partner shall cause the
Partnership to purchase from it a number of Partnership Units equal to the
number of REIT Shares, other capital stock of the General Partner or New
Securities, as the case may be, so purchased on the same terms that the
General Partner purchased such REIT Shares, other capital stock of the General
Partner or New Securities, as the case may be.

 

Section 7.6 _Contracts with Affiliates_

 

A. The Partnership may lend or contribute to, and borrow funds from, Persons
in which it has an equity investment, and such Persons may borrow funds from,
and lend or contribute funds to, the Partnership, on terms and conditions
established in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner. The
foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any
Person.

 

B. Except as provided in _Section 7.5.A_ , the Partnership may transfer assets
to joint ventures, other partnerships, corporations or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions consistent with this Agreement and applicable law
as the General Partner in its sole discretion deems advisable.

 

C. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the
approval of the Limited Partners, may propose and adopt on behalf of the
Partnership employee benefit plans (including without limitation plans that
contemplate the issuance of Profits Interest Units) funded by the Partnership
for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, the Partnership,
Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of them in respect of
services performed or to be performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit
of such entities. The General Partner also is expressly authorized to cause
the Partnership to issue to it Common Units corresponding to REIT Shares
issued by the General Partner pursuant to any Stock Plan or any similar or
successor plan and to repurchase such Partnership Units from the General
Partner to the extent necessary to permit the General Partner to repurchase
such REIT Shares in accordance with such plan.

D. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the General
Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer or convey any property
to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership, directly or indirectly,
except pursuant to transactions that are determined by the General Partner in
good faith to be fair and reasonable.

 



56 E. The General Partner is expressly authorized to enter into, in the name and
on behalf of the Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and
other conflict avoidance agreements with various Affiliates of the Partnership
and the General Partner, on such terms as the General Partner, in its sole and
absolute discretion, believes are advisable.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification_

 

A. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify an
Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and all claims,
demands, subpoenas, requests for information, formal or informal
investigations, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the
Partnership or the General Partner as set forth in this Agreement in which any
Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, unless it is established that: (i) the act or omission of the
Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either
was committed in bad faith, constituted fraud or was the result of active
and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the Indemnitee actually received an improper
personal benefit in money, property or services; or (iii) in the case of any
criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the
act or omission was unlawful. Without limitation, the foregoing indemnity
shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty
or otherwise, for any indebtedness of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership (including, without limitation, any indebtedness which the
Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership has assumed or taken subject
to), and the General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of
the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements consistent
with the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ in favor of any Indemnitee having
or potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. The termination of
any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption
that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth
in this _Section 7.7.A_. The termination of any proceeding by conviction or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or any entry of an order of
probation prior to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the
Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this _Section
7.7.A_. Any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be made
only out of the assets of the Partnership, and any insurance proceeds from
liability policies covering the General Partner and any Indemnitee, and
neither the General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation
to contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to
enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this _Section 7.7_,
except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed to by such Partner and the
Partnership.

 

B. Reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a
proceeding or the recipient of a subpoena or request for information
with respect to a proceeding to which such Indemnitee is not a party may be
paid or reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of the final disposition of
the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a written affirmation by
the Indemnitee of the Indemnitees good faith belief that the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this
_Section 7.7_ has been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of
the Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
the standard of conduct has not been met.

 



57 C. The indemnification provided by this _Section 7.7_ shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law
or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve
in such capacity unless otherwise provided in a written agreement pursuant to
which such Indemnitee is indemnified.

D. The Partnership may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and maintain
insurance, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General
Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or
expenses that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the
Partnerships activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the
power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

E. For purposes of this _Section 7.7_, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit
plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also
imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable
law shall constitute fines within the meaning of _Section 7.7_; and actions
taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in
the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be
in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be
deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the
Partnership.

 

F. In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

G. An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under
this _Section 7.7_ because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction
with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

H. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any
amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.7_ or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect
the limitations on the Partnerships liability to any Indemnitee under this
_Section 7.7_ as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

I. If and to the extent any reimbursements to the General Partner pursuant to
this _Section 7.7_ constitute gross income of the General Partner (as opposed
to the repayment of advances made by the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership) such amounts shall constitute guaranteed payments within the
meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith
by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be treated as distributions
for purposes of computing the Partners Capital Accounts.

 



58 J. Any indemnification hereunder is subject to, and limited by, the provisions
of Section 10-107 of the Act.

K. In the event the Partnership is made a party to any litigation
or otherwise incurs any loss or expense as a result of or in connection with
any Partners personal obligations or liabilities unrelated to Partnership
business, such Partner shall indemnify and reimburse the Partnership for all
such loss and expense incurred, including legal fees, and the Partnership
interest of such Partner may be charged therefor. The liability of a Partner
under this Section 7.7.K shall not be limited to such Partners Partnership
Interest, but shall be enforceable against such Partner personally.

Section 7.8 _Liability of the General Partner_

 

A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of the General Partner nor any of its officers, directors, agents or
employees shall be liable or accountable in damages or otherwise to the
Partnership, any Partners or any Assignees, or their successors or assigns,
for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result
of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or any act or omission if
the General Partner acted in good faith.

B. The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is
acting for the benefit of the Partnership, the Limited Partners and the
General Partners stockholders collectively. Neither the General Partner
generally nor the Board of Directors of the General Partner specifically is
under any obligation to give priority to the separate interests of the Limited
Partners or the General Partners stockholders (including, without limitation,
the tax consequences to Limited Partners or Assignees or to stockholders) in
deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any
actions. If there is a conflict between the interests of the stockholders of
the General Partner on one hand and the Limited Partners on the other,
the General Partner shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a
manner not adverse to either the stockholders of the General Partner or the
Limited Partners; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ for so long as the General
Partner owns a controlling interest in the Partnership, any such conflict
that cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either the stockholders of
the General Partner or the Limited Partners shall be resolved in favor of the
stockholders of the General Partner. The General Partner shall not be liable
under this Agreement to the Partnership or to any Partner for monetary damages
for losses sustained, liabilities incurred, or benefits not derived by Limited
Partners in connection with such decisions; _provided_ , _that_ the General
Partner has acted in good faith.

C. Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
_Section 7.1.A_ , the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted
to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents. The General
Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part
of any such agent appointed by it in good faith.

 



59 D. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.8_ or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect
the limitations on the liability of the General Partner and any of its
officers, directors, agents and employees liability to the Partnership and
the Limited Partners under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to
such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or
relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be
asserted.

report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
the proper party or parties.

 

B. The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in

expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted
in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

C. The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers
and a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact. Each such attorney shall,
to the extent provided by the General Partner in the power of attorney, have
full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and duty which
is permitted or required to be done by the General Partner hereunder.

D. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any non-
mandatory provision of the Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf of
the Partnership or any decision of the General Partner to refrain from acting
on behalf of the Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such
action or omission is necessary or advisable in order to protect the ability
of the General Partner, for so long as the General Partner has determined to
qualify as a REIT, to (i) continue to qualify as a REIT or (ii) avoid the
General Partner incurring any taxes under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the
Code, is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by

Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether
tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an

ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to
any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the
Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General
Partner may determine, including Affiliates of the General Partner. The
General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for
which legal title is held in the name of the General Partner or any nominee
or Affiliate of the General Partner shall be held by the General Partner for
the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner shall use
its best efforts to cause beneficial and record title to such assets to be
vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable. All Partnership
assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and
records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership
assets is held.

 



60 Section 7.11 _Reliance by Third Parties_

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner has
full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any
and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any contracts on behalf of
the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner as if it were the Partnerships sole party in interest, both legally
and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or
other remedies which may be available against such Person to contest, negate
or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in connection with any such
dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement
have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any
act or action of the General Partner or its representatives. Each and every
certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the
Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive
evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming
thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (ii) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or
instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the
Partnership and (iii) such certificate, document or instrument was
duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of

Person.

 

Section 8.4 _Return of Capital_

 

Except pursuant to the rights of Redemption set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_,

A. In addition to other rights provided by this Agreement or by the Act, and
except as limited by _Section 8.5.C_ , each Limited Partner shall have the
right, for a purpose reasonably related to such Limited Partners interest as
a limited partner in the Partnership, upon written demand with a statement of
the purpose of such demand and at such Limited Partners expense: 

(1) to obtain a copy of the most recent annual and quarterly reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the General Partner pursuant
to the Exchange Act, and each communication sent to the stockholders of the
General Partner;

(2) to obtain a copy of the Partnerships federal, state and local income tax
returns for each Partnership Year;

(3) to obtain a current list of the name and last known business, residence
or mailing address of each Partner;

B. The Partnership shall notify each Limited Partner in writing of any
adjustment made in the calculation of the REIT Shares Amount within
a reasonable time after the date such change becomes effective.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 8.5_, the General
Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for such period of
time as the General Partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion to
be reasonable, any information that (i) the General Partner believes to be in
the nature of trade secrets or other information the disclosure of which the
General Partner in good faith believes is not in the best interests of the
Partnership or (ii) the Partnership or the General Partner is required by law
or by agreements with unaffiliated third parties to keep confidential.

Section 8.6 _Limited Partner Redemption Rights_

 

A. On or after the date fourteen (14) months after (i) the Effective Date,
with respect to the Common Units acquired prior to, on or contemporaneously
with the Effective Date, (ii) the Option Agreement Effective Date, with
respect to the Common Units received pursuant to the Option Agreement, (iii)
the ROFO Agreement Effective Date, with respect to the Common Units received
pursuant to the ROFO Agreement, and (iv) the date of issuance of any other
Common Units, in each case unless a different date is expressly provided in an
agreement entered into between the Partnership and any Limited Partner,
each Limited Partner shall have the right (subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in any other such agreement, as applicable) to
require the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the Common Units held by
such Limited Partner (such Common Units being hereafter referred to as "
_Tendered Units_ ") in exchange for the Cash Amount (a " _Redemption_ ");
_provided_ _that_ the terms of such Common Units do not provide that such
Common Units are not entitled to a right of Redemption. Unless otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or in a separate agreement entered into
between the Partnership and the holders of such Common Units, all Common Units
shall be entitled to a right of Redemption hereunder. The Tendering Partner
shall have no right, with respect to any Common Units so redeemed, to receive
any distributions paid on or after the Specified Redemption Date. Any
Redemption shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption delivered to
the General Partner by the Limited Partner who is exercising the right (the "
_Tendering Partner_ "). The Cash Amount shall be payable in accordance with
the instructions set forth in the Notice of Redemption to the Tendering
Partner within ten (10) days of the Specified Redemption Date, except as
provided below.

B. _REIT Share Election_  

(1) Notwithstanding _Section 8.6.A_ above, if a Limited Partner has delivered
to the General Partner a Notice of Redemption then the General Partner may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, (subject to the limitations on ownership
and transfer of REIT Shares set forth in the Charter) elect to acquire some or
all of the Tendered Units from the Tendering Partner in 

 



63  exchange for the REIT Shares Amount (as of the Specified Redemption Date)
and, if the General Partner so elects, the Tendering Partner shall sell the
Tendered Units to the General Partner in exchange for the REIT Shares Amount.
In such event, the Tendering Partner shall have no right to cause the
Partnership to redeem such Tendered Units. The General Partner shall promptly
give such Tendering Partner written notice of its election, and subject to
_Section 8.6.C_ below, the Tendering Partner may elect to withdraw its
redemption request at any time prior to the receipt of cash pursuant to
_Section 8.6.A_ or REIT Shares Amount pursuant to this _Section 8.6.B_ by
such Tendering Partner.

(2) The REIT Shares Amount, if applicable, shall be delivered as duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable REIT Shares and, if
applicable, free of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction, other than
those provided in the Charter, the Bylaws of the General Partner, the
Securities Act, relevant state securities or blue sky laws and any applicable
registration rights agreement with respect to such REIT Shares entered into by
the Tendering Partner. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with
respect to any Redemption pursuant to this Section 8.6, the Tendering
Partner shall continue to own all Tendered Units subject to any Redemption
(and be treated as a Limited Partner, an Assignee or a Person who is the
transferee of a Limited Partner Interest in a permitted transfer pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 11.3_, as the case may be, with respect to such Tendered Units
for all purposes of this Agreement) until such Tendered Units are Transferred
to the Partnership and such Tendering Partner has received the Cash Amount or
REIT Shares Amount, as the case may be, in exchange for such Tendered Units.
Unless and until the Tendering Partner has received the REIT Shares Amount in
exchange for such Tendered Units pursuant to this Section 8.6.B, the Tendering
Partner shall have no rights as a stockholder of the General Partner with
respect to the REIT Shares issuable in connection with such Redemption
(including, without limitation, rights to vote or consent, receive dividends
and exercise other rights).

 

In addition, the REIT Shares for which the Common Units might be exchanged
shall also bear a legend which generally provides the following: 

THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO
RESTRICTIONS ON BENEFICIAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER FOR THE
PURPOSE OF THE CORPORATIONS MAINTENANCE OF ITS STATUS AS A REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENT TRUST ("REIT") UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED
(THE "CODE"). SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FURTHER RESTRICTIONS AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THE CORPORATIONS ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT, (i) NO
PERSON MAY BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
CORPORATION IN EXCESS OF 9.8% OF THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF
CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CORPORATION AND NO PERSON MAY BENEFICIALLY OR
CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES OF THE CORPORATIONS COMMON STOCK IN EXCESS OF 9.8%
(BY VALUE OR BY NUMBER OF SHARES, WHICHEVER IS MORE RESTRICTIVE) OF
THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION; (ii) NO PERSON MAY
BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK THAT WOULD RESULT
IN THE CORPORATION BEING "CLOSELY HELD" UNDER SECTION 856(h) OF THE CODE OR
OTHERWISE CAUSE THE CORPORATION TO FAIL TO

 



64  QUALIFY AS A REIT; AND (iii) NO PERSON MAY TRANSFER SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK
IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD RESULT IN THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CORPORATION BEING
OWNED BY FEWER THAN 100 PERSONS. ANY PERSON WHO BENEFICIALLY OR
CONSTRUCTIVELY OWNS OR ATTEMPTS TO BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES
OF CAPITAL STOCK IN VIOLATION OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY
THE CORPORATION. IF ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OR OWNERSHIP SET
FORTH IN (i) OR (ii) IS VIOLATED, THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED
HEREBY WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUSTEE OF A TRUST FOR THE
BENEFIT OF ONE OR MORE CHARITABLE BENEFICIARIES, AND ANY TRANSFER THAT
WOULD RESULT IN THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CORPORATION BEING OWNED BY FEWER
THAN 100 PERSONS SHALL BE VOID _AB_ _INITIO_. IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION MAY
REDEEM SHARES UPON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIED BY THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINES THAT
OWNERSHIP OR A TRANSFER OR OTHER EVENT MAY VIOLATE THE RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED
ABOVE. FURTHERMORE, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS, ATTEMPTED TRANSFERS
IN VIOLATION OF THE RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE VOID AB INITIO. ALL
TERMS IN THIS LEGEND THAT ARE DEFINED IN THE CHARTER OF THE CORPORATION SHALL
HAVE THE MEANINGS ASCRIBED TO THEM IN THE CHARTER OF THE CORPORATION, AS THE
SAME MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, A COPY OF WHICH, INCLUDING THE
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OWNERSHIP, WILL BE FURNISHED TO EACH HOLDER OF
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE. REQUESTS FOR SUCH A COPY
MAY BE DIRECTED TO THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION AT ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICE.

_Stock Offering Funding Option_

 

(1) (a) Notwithstanding _Section 8.6.A_ or _Section 8.6.B_ above, if a Limited
Partner has delivered to the General Partner a Notice of Redemption with
respect to Excess Units, and (i) the number of Excess Units plus the number of
Tendered Units such Limited Partner agrees to treat as Excess Units (the "
_Offering Units_ ") exceeds (A) 9.8% of the REIT Shares, calculated in
accordance with the methodology for calculating the percentage of ownership of
a Person for purposes of the ownership limit pursuant to Article VI of the
Charter (subject to adjustment in connection with any Adjustment Event), and
(B) $50,000,000 gross value based on a Partnership Unit price equal to the
REIT Share Market Value, and (ii) the General Partner is eligible to file a
registration statement under Form S-3 (or any successor form similar
thereto), then the General Partner may, at its election, either (x) cause the
Partnership to redeem the Offering Units with the proceeds of an offering,
whether registered under the Securities Act or exempt from such
registration, underwritten, offered and sold directly to investors or through
agents or other intermediaries, or otherwise distributed (a " _Stock Offering
Funding_ ") of a number of REIT Shares (" _Offered Shares_ ") equal to the
REIT Shares Amount with respect to the Offering Units pursuant to the terms
of this _Section 8.6.C_ ; or (y) cause the Partnership to pay the Cash Amount
with respect to the Excess Units pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.6.A_ ;
or (z) acquire the Excess Units in exchange for the REIT Shares Amount
pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.6.B_ , but only if the Tendering Partner
provides the General Partner with

 



65  any representations or undertakings which the General Partner has
determined, in its sole and absolute discretion, are sufficient to prevent a
violation of the Charter. In the event that the General Partner fails to give
notice of its exercise of the election described in clause (i) above within
the period of time specified in _Section 8.6.B_ for an election to deliver the
REIT Share Amount, it will be deemed to have elected not to purchase the
Tendered Units through a Stock Offering Funding.

(b) In the event that the General Partner elects a Stock Offering Funding
with respect to a Notice of Redemption, it may at such time give notice (a "
_Single Funding Notice_ ") of such election to all Limited Partners and
require that all Limited Partners elect whether or not to effect a
Redemption to be funded through such Stock Offering Funding. In the event a
Limited Partner elects to effect such a Redemption, it shall give notice
thereof and of the number of Common Units to be made subject thereto in
writing to the General Partner within 10 Business Days after receipt of the
Single Funding Notice, and such Limited Partner shall be treated as a
Tendering Partner for all purposes of this _Section 8.6.C_. In the event that
a Limited Partner does not so elect, it shall be deemed to have waived its
right to effect a Redemption for the current Twelve-Month Period, except that
it may effect a Redemption for no more than 1.0% of the REIT Shares,
calculated in accordance with the methodology for calculating the percentage
of ownership of a Person for purposes of the ownership limit pursuant to
Article VI of the Charter (subject to adjustment in connection with any
Adjustment Event) during such Twelve-Month Period.

 

(2) In the event that the General Partner elects a Stock Offering Funding, on
the Specified Redemption Date determined pursuant to the proviso in the
definition thereof it shall purchase each Offering Unit that is still a
Tendered Unit on such date for cash in immediately available funds in the
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Cash Amount per Common Unit, calculated
pursuant to  _Section 8.6.A_ as of the original Specified Redemption Date
assuming the General Partner did not elect to conduct a Stock Offering Funding
pursuant to _Section 8.6.C_ (the " _Base Amount_ ") or (ii) the net proceeds
per Offered Share received by the General Partner from the Stock Offering
Funding, determined after deduction of reasonable expenses related thereto,
including underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees
and expenses, Securities and Exchange Commission registration fees, state
blue sky and securities laws fees and expenses, printing expenses, NASD filing
fees and listing fees (the " _Net Proceeds_ ").

 

(3) If the General Partner elects a Stock Offering Funding, the following
additional terms and conditions shall apply:

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the General Partner gives the Tendering
Partner notice of its election pursuant to _Section 8.6.C(1)(a)(i)_ , the
General Partner shall use its reasonable efforts to effect as promptly as
possible a registration, qualification or compliance (including, without
limitation, the execution of an undertaking to file post-effective
amendments, appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other
state securities laws and appropriate compliance with applicable regulations
issued under the Securities Act and any other governmental requirements or
regulations) as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of the
Offered Shares; _provided_ , _that_ , the General Partner shall not by reason
hereof, be required to submit to jurisdiction or taxation, or qualify to do
business in any jurisdiction in which such 

 



66  submission or qualification would not be otherwise required; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the General Partner shall deliver a certificate to the
Tendering Partner stating that the General Partner has determined in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the General Partner that such
filing, registration or qualification would require disclosure of material
non-public information, the disclosure of which would have a material adverse
effect on the General Partner, then the General Partner may delay making any
filing or delay the effectiveness of any registration or qualification for the
shorter of (a) the period ending on the date upon which such information is
disclosed to the public or ceases to be material or (b) an aggregate period of
ninety (90) days in connection with any Stock Offering Funding.

 

(b) The General Partner shall advise each Tendering Partner, regularly and
promptly upon any request, of the status of the Stock Offering Funding
process, including the timing of all filings, the selection of and
understandings with underwriters, agents, dealers and brokers, the nature and
contents of all communications with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
other governmental bodies, the expenses related to the Stock Offering Funding
as they are being incurred, the nature of marketing activities, and any other
matters reasonably related to the timing, price and expenses relating to the
Stock Offering Funding and the compliance by the General Partner with its
obligations with respect thereto. In addition, the General Partner and each
Tendering Partner may, but shall be under no obligation to, enter into
understandings in writing (" _Pricing Agreements_ ") whereby the Tendering
Partner will agree in advance as to the acceptability of a Net Proceeds amount
at or below the Base Amount. Furthermore, the General Partner shall establish
pricing notification procedures with each such Tendering Partner, such that
the Tendering Partner will have the maximum opportunity practicable to
determine whether to become a Withdrawing Partner pursuant to _Section
8.6.C(3)(c)_ below.

 

(c) The General Partner, upon notification of the price per REIT Share in the
Stock Offering Funding from the managing underwriter(s), in the case of a
registered public offering, or lead placement agent(s), in the event of an
unregistered offering, engaged by the General Partner in order to sell the
Offered Shares, shall immediately use its reasonable efforts to notify each
Tendering Partner of the price per REIT Share in the Stock Offering Funding
and resulting Net Proceeds. Each Tendering Partner shall have one hour (as
such time may be extended by the General Partner) to elect to withdraw its
Redemption (a Tendering Partner making such an election being a "
_Withdrawing Partner_ "), and Common Units with a REIT Shares Amount equal to
such excluded Offered Shares shall be considered to be withdrawn from the
related Redemption; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if Tendering Partners
withdraw in excess of 20% of the Offered Shares, all Offered Shares will, at
the General Partners option, be deemed to have been withdrawn by all
Tendering Partners. If a Tendering Partner, within such time period, does not
notify the General Partner of such Tendering Partners election not to become
a Withdrawing Partner, then such Tendering Partner shall, except as otherwise
provided in a Pricing Agreement, be deemed not to have withdrawn from the
Redemption, without liability to the General Partner. To the extent that the
General Partner is unable to notify any Tendering Partner, such unnotified
Tendering Partner shall, except as otherwise provided in any
Pricing Agreement, be deemed not to have elected to become a Withdrawing
Partner. Each Tendering Partner whose Redemption is being funded through the
Stock Offering Funding who does not become a Withdrawing Partner shall have
the right, subject to the approval of the managing underwriter(s) or
placement agent(s) and restrictions of any applicable securities laws, to
submit

 



67  for Redemption additional Common Units in a number no greater than the
number of Common Units withdrawn. If more than one Tendering Partner so elects
to redeem additional Common Units, then such Common Units shall be redeemed
on a pro rata basis, based on the number of additional Common Units sought to
be so redeemed. To the extent that the Net Proceeds would be below the Base
Amount, and to the extent that other Partners have not elected to redeem
additional Common Units, then the Withdrawing Partners shall bear their pro
rata shares of the expenses described in _Section 8.6.C(2)_ (such shares
calculated as if such Limited Partners had not been Withdrawing Partners)
as reasonably determined by the General Partner.

(d) The General Partner shall take all reasonable action in order to
effectuate the sale of the Offered Shares including, but not limited to, the
entering into of an underwriting or placement agreement in customary form with
the managing underwriter(s) or placement agent(s) selected for such
underwriting by the General Partner. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if the managing underwriter(s) or placement agent(s) advises
the General Partner in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of
the number of shares to be offered, then the General Partner shall so advise
all Tendering Partners and the number of Common Units to be sold to the
General Partner pursuant to the Redemption shall be allocated among all
Tendering Partners in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
respective number of Common Units as to which each Tendering Partner elected
to effect a Redemption. No Offered Shares excluded from the underwriting by
reason of the managing underwriters or placement agents marketing limitation
shall be included in such offering.

(e) The General Partner may include securities for its own account in any
offering made pursuant to _Section 8.6.C.1_ and, if the managing underwriter
or placement agent has not limited the number of Registrable Shares to be
offered, the General Partner may include securities for the account of others
in such offering, in each case only if and to the extent that the managing
underwriter or placement agent, the General Partner and Tendering Partners
owning Common Units representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
Common Units with respect to which the Stock Offering Funding is
being effected so agree in writing.

D. Each Limited Partner covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all
Tendered Units shall be delivered to the General Partner free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances whatsoever and should any such liens,
claims and/or encumbrances exist or arise with respect to such Tendered Units,
the General Partner shall be under no obligation to acquire the same. Each
Limited Partner further agrees that, in the event any state or local property
transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Tendered Units to
the General Partner (or its designee), such Limited Partner shall assume and
pay such transfer tax.

E. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 8.6.A_ , _8.6.B_ , _8.6.C_
or any other provision of this Agreement, a Limited Partner (i) shall not be
entitled to effect a Redemption for cash pursuant to _Section 8.6.A_ or an
exchange for REIT Shares pursuant to _Section 8.6.B_ to the extent the
ownership or right to acquire REIT Shares pursuant to such exchange by such
Partner on the Specified Redemption Date could cause such Partner or any other
Person, or, in the opinion of counsel selected by the General Partner, may
cause such Partner or any other Person, to violate the restrictions on
ownership and transfer of REIT Shares set forth in the Charter and (ii) shall
have no rights under this Agreement to acquire REIT Shares which would
otherwise be prohibited under the Charter. The limitation set forth in
_Section 8.6.E(i)_ above shall not limit the

 



68  ability of a Limited Partner to require a Stock Offering Funding pursuant to
the terms of _Section 8.6.C if (A)_ the Offering Units exceed (a) 9.8% of the
REIT Shares, calculated in accordance with the methodology for calculating
the percentage of ownership of a Person for purposes of the ownership limit
pursuant to Article VI of the Charter (subject to adjustment in connection
with any Adjustment Event) and (b) $50,000,000 gross value based on a Common
Unit price equal to the REIT Share Market Value, and (B) the General Partner
is eligible to file a registration statement under Form S-3 (or any successor
form similar thereto). To the extent any attempted Redemption or exchange for
REIT Shares would be in violation of this _Section 8.6.E_ , it shall be null
and void _ab initio_ and such Limited Partner shall not acquire any rights or
economic interest in the cash otherwise payable upon such Redemption or the
REIT Shares otherwise issuable upon such exchange.

F. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to _Section
8.6.E_ , with respect to any Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares pursuant
to this Section 8.6):

 

(1) All Common Units acquired by the General Partner pursuant thereto shall
automatically, and without further action required, be converted into and
deemed to be General Partner Interests comprised of the same number and class
of Common Units.

(2) Without the consent of the General Partner, each Limited Partner may not
effect a Redemption for less than 1,000 Common Units or, if the Limited
Partner holds less than 1,000 Common Units, all of the Common Units held by
such Limited Partner.

 

(3) Without the consent of the General Partner, each Limited Partner may not
effect a Redemption during the period after the Partnership Record Date with
respect to a distribution and before the record date established by the
General Partner for a distribution to its common stockholders of some or all
of its portion of such distribution.

 

(4) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the General
Partner gives notice to all Limited Partners (a " _Primary Offering Notice_
") that it desires to effect a primary offering of its equity securities for
cash (other than an offering in connection with a merger, consolidation or
similar transaction, or employee benefit or similar plans) then, unless the
General Partner otherwise consents, the actions described in _Section 8.6.C_
as to a Stock Offering Funding with respect to any Notice of Redemption with
respect to Excess Units thereafter received may be delayed until the earlier
of (a) the completion of the primary offering or (b) 120 days following the
giving of the Primary Offering Notice; _provided_ _that_ , to the extent that
the managing underwriter(s) of such primary offering advise that the inclusion
of such additional REIT Shares will not adversely affect the offering,
additional REIT Shares the proceeds of which are to be used to satisfy a
Redemption with respect to such Excess Units (a " _Subsequent Redemption_ ")
(without regard to the limitations of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph F)
shall be included in such offering, and the procedures of this _Section 8.6_
shall otherwise be followed as closely as practicable; _provided_ , _further_
_that_ a Primary Offering Notice may be given no more than twice in any
Twelve-Month Period without the Consent of the Limited Partners.

 



69 (5) The General Partner may delay a Stock Offering Funding, such that it will
not occur (a) during the same Twelve-Month Period as the General Partner has
effected a "Demand Registration" pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreements dated as of October 27, 2004, among the General Partner and certain
Limited Partners (it being understood that in the event a Notice of
Redemption is received prior to the receipt of requisite requests for a Demand
Registration, such Notice of Redemption shall control, and vice versa) or (b)
within 120 days following the closing of any prior public offering of similar
securities by the General Partner.

(6) The consummation of any Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares shall be
subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, if
any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended.

 

(7) Each Tendering Partner shall continue to own all Common Units subject to
any Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares, and be treated as a Limited
Partner with respect to such Common Units for all purposes of this Agreement,
until such Common Units are transferred to the General Partner and paid for or
exchanged on the Specified Redemption Date. Until a Specified Redemption Date,
and provided the General Partner has issued REIT shares pursuant to _Section
8.6.B_ , the Tendering Partner shall have no rights as a stockholder of the
General Partner with respect to such Tendering Partners Common Units.

 

G. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 8.6_ permitting the
General Partner to delay a Public Offering Funding by virtue of an event
described in _Section 8.6.C_ , the giving of a Primary Offering Notice, or a
delay referred to in Section 8.6.F(5), the General Partner shall use its
reasonable efforts to take all such actions, as are consistent with the
purposes of such delay provisions, to effect a Stock Offering Funding at the
earliest time practicable. It is understood that such periods of delay shall
run, to the extent practicable, concurrently, and shall not limit the right of
a Limited Partner to deliver a Notice of Redemption.

H. In the event that the Partnership issues additional Partnership Interests
to any Additional Limited Partner pursuant to _Section 4.3.B_ , the General
Partner shall make such revisions to this _Section 8.6_ as it determines are
necessary to reflect the issuance of such additional Partnership Interests.

 

Section 8.7 _Conversion of Profits Interest Units_.

 

A. A Profits Interest Unitholder shall have the right (the " _Conversion
Right_ "), at his or her option, at any time to convert all or a portion of
his or her Vested Profits Interest Units into Common Units; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that a holder may not exercise the Conversion Right for less than
one thousand (1,000) Vested Profits Interest Units or, if such holder holds
less than one thousand Vested Profits Interest Units, all of the Vested
Profits Interest Units held by such holder. Profits Interest Unitholders shall
not have the right to convert Unvested Profits Interest Units into Common
Units until they become Vested Profits Interest Units; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that when a Profits Interest Unitholder is notified of the
expected occurrence of an event that will cause his or her Unvested Profits
Interest Units to become Vested Profits Interest Units, such Profits Interest
Unitholder may give the Partnership a Conversion Notice conditioned upon and
effective as of the time of vesting and such Conversion Notice, unless
subsequently revoked by the Profits Interest Unitholder, shall be accepted by
the Partnership subject to such condition. In all cases, the conversion of any
Profits Interest Units into Common Units shall be subject to the conditions
and procedures set forth in this _Section 8.7_. 

 



70 B. A holder of Vested Profits Interest Units may convert such Units into an
equal number of fully paid and non-assessable Common Units, giving effect to
all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to _Section 4.5_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event may a holder of Vested Profits Interest Units convert
a number of Vested Profits Interest Units that exceeds (x) the Economic
Capital Account Balance of such Limited Partner, to the extent attributable to
his or her ownership of Profits Interest Units, divided by (y) the
Common Unit Economic Balance, in each case as determined as of the effective
date of conversion (the " _Capital Account Limitation_ "). In order to
exercise his or her Conversion Right, a Profits Interest Unitholder shall
deliver a notice (a " _Conversion Notice_ ") in the form attached as _Exhibit
G_ to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) not less than 10
nor more than 60 days prior to a date (the " _Conversion Date_ ") specified in
such Conversion Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the General Partner
has not given to the Profits Interest Unitholders notice of a proposed or
upcoming Transaction (as defined below) at least thirty (30) days prior to the
effective date of such Transaction, then Profits Interest Unitholders shall
have the right to deliver a Conversion Notice until the earlier of (x) the
tenth (10th) day after such notice from the General Partner of a Transaction
or (y) the third Business Day immediately preceding the effective date of
such Transaction. A Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided
in _Section 15.1_. Each Profits Interest Unitholder covenants and agrees with
the Partnership that all Vested Profits Interest Units to be converted
pursuant to this _Section 8.7.A_ shall be free and clear of all liens.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a holder of Profits Interest
Units may deliver a Redemption Notice pursuant to  _Section 8.6.A_ relating
to those Common Units that will be issued to such holder upon conversion of
such Profits Interest Units into Common Units in advance of the Conversion
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the redemption of such Common Units by
the Partnership shall in no event take place until on or after the Conversion
Date. For clarity, it is noted that the objective of this paragraph is to put
a Profits Interest Unitholder in a position where, if he or she so
wishes, the Common Units into which his or her Vested Profits Interest Units
will be converted can be redeemed by the Partnership pursuant to _Section
8.6.A_ simultaneously with such conversion, with the further consequence that,
if the Company elects to assume the Partnerships redemption obligation with
respect to such Common Units under _Section 8.6.B_ by delivering to such
holder REIT Shares rather than cash, then such holder can have such REIT
Shares issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion of his or her
Vested Profits Interest Units into Common Units. The General Partner shall
cooperate with a Profits Interest Unitholder to coordinate the timing of the
different events described in the foregoing sentence.

C. The Partnership, at any time at the election of the General Partner, may
cause any number of Vested Profits Interest Units held by a Profits Interest
Unitholder to be converted (a " _Forced Conversion_ ") into an equal number of
Common Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to
_Section 4.5_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership may not cause a
Forced Conversion of any Profits Interest Units that would not at the time be
eligible for conversion at the option of such Profits Interest Unitholder
pursuant to _Section 8.7.B_. In order to exercise its right of Forced
Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a notice (a " _Forced Conversion
Notice_ ") in the form attached as _Exhibit H_ to the applicable Profits
Interest Unitholder not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the
Conversion Date specified in such Forced Conversion Notice. A Forced
Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in _Section 15.1_.

 



71 D. A conversion of Vested Profits Interest Units for which the holder thereof
has given a Conversion Notice or the Partnership has given a Forced
Conversion Notice shall occur automatically after the close of business on the
applicable Conversion Date without any action on the part of such Profits
Interest Unitholder, as of which time such Profits Interest Unitholder shall
be credited on the books and records of the Partnership with the issuance as
of the opening of business on the next day of the number of Common Units
issuable upon such conversion. After the conversion of Profits Interest Units
as aforesaid, the Partnership shall deliver to such Profits Interest
Unitholder, upon his or her written request, a certificate of the General
Partner certifying the number of Common Units and remaining Profits Interest
Units, if any, held by such person immediately after such conversion. The
Assignee of any Limited Partner pursuant to _Article 11_ may exercise the
rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this _Section 8.7_ and such
Limited Partner shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by the
Assignee.

E. For purposes of making future allocations under _Section 6.2.C_
and applying the Capital Account Limitation, the portion of the Economic
Capital Account Balance of the applicable Profits Interest Unitholder that is
treated as attributable to his or her Profits Interest Units shall be reduced,
as of the date of conversion, by the product of the number of Profits
Interest Units converted and the Common Unit Economic Balance.

F. If the Partnership or the General Partner shall be a party to any
transaction (including without limitation a merger, consolidation, unit
exchange, self tender offer for all or substantially all Common Units or other
business combination or reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all
of the Partnerships assets, but excluding any transaction which constitutes
an Adjustment Event) in each case as a result of which Common Units shall be
exchanged for or converted into the right, or the Holders shall otherwise be
entitled, to receive cash, securities or other property or any combination
thereof (each of the foregoing being referred to herein as a " _Transaction_
"), then the General Partner shall, immediately prior to the Transaction,
exercise its right to cause a Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum
number of Profits Interest Units then eligible for conversion, taking into
account any allocations that occur in connection with the Transaction or that
would occur in connection with the Transaction if the assets of the
Partnership were sold at the Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value
determined by the General Partner in good faith using the value attributed to
the Common Units in the context of the Transaction (in which case the
Conversion Date shall be the effective date of the Transaction). In
anticipation of such Forced Conversion and the consummation of the
Transaction, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each Profits Interest Unitholder to be afforded the right to receive
in connection with such Transaction in consideration for the Common Units into
which his or her Profits Interest Units will be converted the same kind and
amount of cash, securities and other property (or any combination thereof)
receivable upon the consummation of such Transaction by a Holder of the same
number of Common Units, assuming such Holder is not a Person with which the
Partnership consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or which merged
into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case
may be (a " _Constituent Person_ "), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person.
In the event that Holders have the opportunity to elect the form or type of
consideration to be received upon consummation of the Transaction, prior to
such Transaction the General Partner shall give prompt written notice to each
Profits Interest Unitholder of such election, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the Profits Interest Unitholders the right to
elect, by written notice to the General Partner, the form or type of
consideration to be

 



72  received upon conversion of each Profits Interest Unit held by such holder
into Common Units in connection with such Transaction. If a Profits Interest
Unitholder fails to make such an election, such holder (and any of its
transferees) shall receive upon conversion of each Profits Interest Unit held
by him or her (or by any of his or her transferees) the same kind and amount
of consideration that a Holder would receive if such Holder failed to make
such an election. Subject to the rights of the Partnership and the Company
under any Vesting Agreement and the relevant terms of any applicable Stock
Plan, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable effort to cause the
terms of any Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this
_Section 8.7.F_ and to enter into an agreement with the successor or
purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit of any Profits Interest
Unitholders whose Profits Interest Units will not be converted into Common
Units in connection with the Transaction that will (i) contain provisions
enabling the holders of Profits Interest Units that remain outstanding after
such Transaction to convert their Profits Interest Units into securities as
comparable as reasonably possible under the circumstances to the Common Units
and (ii) preserve as far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the
distribution, special allocation, conversion, and other rights set forth in
the Agreement for the benefit of the Profits Interest Unitholders.

Section 8.8 _Voting Rights of Profits Interest Units_

 

Profits Interest Unitholders shall (a) have those voting rights required from
time to time by applicable law, if any, (b) have the same voting rights as a
Holder, with the Profits Interest Units voting as a single class with the
Common Units and having one vote per Profits Interest Unit; and (c) have the
additional voting rights that are expressly set forth below. So long as any
Profits Interest Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Profits
Interest Units outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in
writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or
repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the provisions of the
Agreement applicable to Profits Interest Units so as to materially and
adversely affect any right, privilege or voting power of the Profits Interest
Units or the Profits Interest Unitholders as such, unless such amendment,
alteration, or repeal affects equally, ratably and proportionately the rights,
privileges and voting powers of the holders of Common Units; but subject, in
any event, to the following provisions: (i) with respect to any Transaction,
so long as the Profits Interest Units are treated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8.7.F_, the consummation of such Transaction shall not be deemed to
materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers of the Profits Interest Units or the Profits Interest Unitholders as
such; and (ii) any creation or issuance of any Partnership Units or of any
class or series of Partnership Interest including without limitation
additional Partnership Units or Profits Interest Units, whether ranking senior
to, junior to, or on a parity with the Profits Interest Units with respect to
distributions and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Profits Interest Units
or the Profits Interest Unitholders as such. The foregoing voting provisions
will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which
such vote would otherwise be required will be effected, all outstanding
Profits Interest Units shall have been converted into Common Units.

and copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3_. Any records maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership in the
regular course of its business may be kept on, or be in the form of any
information storage device, _provided_ , _that_ the records so maintained are

time. The books of the Partnership shall be maintained, for financial and tax

Securities and Exchange Commission, the General Partner shall cause to be

annual report containing financial statements of the Partnership, or of the
General Partner if such statements are prepared solely on a consolidated
basis with the General Partner, for such Partnership Year, presented in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such statements to
be audited by a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
selected by the General Partner.

B. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days after the close
of each calendar quarter (except the last calendar quarter of each year), or
such earlier date as they are filed with the Securities and Exchange

Partner as of the last day of the calendar quarter, a report containing

if such statements are prepared solely on a consolidated basis with the
applicable law or regulation, or as the General Partner determines to be

Section 9.4 _Nondisclosure of Certain Information_

 

Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 9.1_ and _9.3_ , the General
Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners any information that
the General Partner believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other
information the disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith believes
is not in the best interest of the Partnership or which the Partnership
is required by law or by agreements with unaffiliated third parties to keep
confidential.

 



74 ARTICLE 10.

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns_

The General Partner shall arrange for the preparation and timely filing of all
returns of Partnership income, gains, deductions, losses and other items
required of the Partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and
shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish, within 120 days of the close of
each taxable year, the tax information reasonably required by Limited
Partners for federal and state income tax reporting purposes. Each Limited
Partner shall promptly provide the General Partner with any information
reasonably requested by the General Partner relating to any Contributed
Property contributed (directly or indirectly) by such Limited Partner to the
Partnership.

Section 10.2 _Tax Elections_

 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall, in its sole
and absolute discretion, determine whether to make any available election
pursuant to the Code, including the election under Section 754 of the Code.
The General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any such election
(including without limitation, any election under Section 754 of the
Code) upon the General Partners determination in its sole and absolute
discretion that such revocation is the best interests of the Partners.

 

Section 10.3 _Tax Matters Partner_

A. The General Partner shall be the " _tax matters partner_ " of the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to Section 6230(e) of
the Code, upon receipt of notice from the IRS of the beginning of an
administrative proceeding with respect to the Partnership, the tax matters
partner shall furnish the IRS with the name, address and profit interest of
each of the Limited Partners and Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
information is provided to the Partnership by the Limited Partners and
Assignees.

B. The tax matters partner is authorized, but not required:

 

(1) to enter into any settlement with the IRS with respect to any
administrative or judicial proceedings for the adjustment of
Partnership items required to be taken into account by a Partner for income
tax purposes (such administrative proceedings being referred to as a " _tax
audit_ " and such judicial proceedings being referred to as " _judicial
review_ "), and in the settlement agreement the tax matters partner may
expressly state that such agreement shall bind all Partners, except that such
settlement agreement shall not bind any Partner (i) who (within the time
prescribed pursuant to the Code and Regulations) files a statement with the
IRS providing that the tax matters partner shall not have the authority to
enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of such Partner or (ii) who is a "
_notice partner_ " (as defined in Section 6231 of the Code) or a member of a
" _notice group_ " (as defined in Section 6223(b)(2) of the Code);

 



75 (2) in the event that a notice of a final administrative adjustment at the
Partnership level of any item required to be taken into account by a Partner
for tax purposes (a " _final adjustment_ ") is mailed to the tax matters
partner, to seek judicial review of such final adjustment, including the
filing of a petition for readjustment with the Tax Court or the United States
Claims Court, or the filing of a complaint for refund with the District Court
of the United States for the district in which the Partnerships principal
place of business is located;

 

(3) to intervene in any action brought by any other Partner for judicial
review of a final adjustment;

 

(4) to file a request for an administrative adjustment with the IRS at any
time and, if any part of such request is not allowed by the IRS, to file an
appropriate pleading (petition or complaint) for judicial review with respect
to such request;

(5) to enter into an agreement with the IRS to extend the period for
assessing any tax which is attributable to any item required to be taken into
account by a Partner for tax purposes, or an item affected by such item; and

 

(6) to take any other action on behalf of the Partners of the Partnership in
connection with any tax audit or judicial review proceeding to the extent
permitted by applicable law or regulations.

The taking of any action and the incurring of any expense by the tax
matters partner in connection with any such proceeding, except to the extent
required by law, is a matter in the sole and absolute discretion of the tax
matters partner and the provisions relating to indemnification of the General
Partner set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be fully applicable to the
tax matters partner in its capacity as such.

C. The tax matters partner shall receive no compensation for its services.
All third party costs and expenses incurred by the tax matters partner in
performing its duties as such (including legal and accounting fees) shall be
borne by the Partnership. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the
Partnership from engaging an accounting firm or law firm to assist the tax
matters partner in discharging its duties hereunder, so long as the
compensation paid by the Partnership for such services is reasonable. 

Section 10.4 _Organizational Expenses_

 

The Partnership shall elect to deduct expenses, if any, incurred by it in
organizing the Partnership ratably over a 60-month period as provided in
Section 709 of the Code.

Section 10.5 _Withholding_

 

Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold from or pay
on behalf of or with respect to such Limited Partner any amount of federal,
state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines that the
Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to any amount
distributable or allocable to such Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any taxes required to be withheld or paid by
the Partnership pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 or 1446 of the Code. Any
amount paid on behalf of or with respect to a Limited Partner shall constitute
a receivable of the Partnership from such Limited Partner, which receivable
shall be paid by such Limited Partner within 15 days

 



76  after notice from the General Partner that such payment must be made unless
(i) the Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which would
otherwise be made to the Limited Partner or (ii) the General Partner
determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be
satisfied out of the available funds of the Partnership which would, but for
such payment, be distributed to the Limited Partner. Any amounts withheld
pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having been
distributed to such Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest
in such Limited Partners Partnership Interest to secure such Limited
Partners obligation to pay to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_. Any amounts payable by a
Limited Partner hereunder shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate
loans at large United States money center commercial banks, as published from
time to time in the _Wall Street Journal_ , plus two percentage points (but
not higher than the maximum lawful rate) from the date such amount is due (
_i.e._ , 15 days after demand) until such amount is paid in full. Each Limited
Partner shall take such actions as the Partnership or the General Partner
shall request in order to perfect or enforce the security interest created
hereunder.

ARTICLE 11.

 

TRANSFERS AND WITHDRAWALS

Section 11.1  _Transfer_

A. The term " _transfer_ ," when used in this _Article 11_ with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which the
General Partner purports to assign its General Partner Interest to another
Person or by which a Limited Partner purports to assign its Limited Partner
Interest to another Person, and includes a sale, assignment, gift (outright
or in trust), pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any
other disposition by law or otherwise. The term "transfer" when used in this
_Article 11_ does not include any Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares
pursuant to _Section 8.6_ except as otherwise provided herein. No part of the
interest of a Limited Partner shall be subject to the claims of any creditor,
any spouse for alimony or support, or to legal process, and may not be
voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered except as may be
specifically provided for in this Agreement or consented to by the General
Partner.

 

B. No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this  _Article 11_.
Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this _Article 11_ shall be null and void _ab initio_ unless
otherwise consented to by the General Partner in its sole and
absolute discretion.

Section 11.2 _Transfer of General Partner s Partnership Interest_

 

A. Except in connection with a Termination Transaction permitted under
_Section 11.2.B_ , the General Partner shall not withdraw from
the Partnership and shall not transfer all or any portion of its interest in
the Partnership (whether by sale, statutory merger or consolidation,
liquidation or otherwise), other than to an Affiliate, without the Consent of
the Limited Partners, which may be given or withheld by each Limited Partner
in its sole and absolute discretion, and

 



77  only upon the admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to _Section
12.1_. Upon any transfer of a Partnership Interest in accordance with the
provisions of this  _Section 11.2_, the transferee shall become a substitute
General Partner for all purposes herein, and shall be vested with the powers
and rights of the transferor General Partner, and shall be liable for all
obligations and responsible for all duties of the General Partner, once such
transferee has executed such instruments as may be necessary to effectuate
such admission and to confirm the agreement of such transferee to be bound by
all the terms and provisions of this Agreement with respect to the
Partnership Interest so acquired. It is a condition to any transfer otherwise
permitted hereunder that the transferee assumes, by operation of law or
express agreement, all of the obligations of the transferor General Partner
under this Agreement with respect to such transferred Partnership Interest,
and no such transfer (other than pursuant to a statutory merger or
consolidation wherein all obligations and liabilities of the transferor
General Partner are assumed by a successor corporation by operation of law)
shall relieve the transferor General Partner of its obligations under this
Agreement without the Consent of the Limited Partners, in their reasonable
discretion. In the event the General Partner withdraws from the Partnership,
in violation of this Agreement or otherwise, or otherwise dissolves or
terminates, or upon the Incapacity of the General Partner, all of the
remaining Partners may elect to continue the Partnership business by selecting
a substitute General Partner in accordance with the Act.

B. The General Partner shall not engage in any merger, consolidation or
other combination with or into another person, sale of all or substantially
all of its assets or any reclassification, recapitalization or change of its
outstanding equity interests (" _Termination Transaction_ ") unless (1)
the Termination Transaction has been approved by a Consent of the Partners
and (2) either clause (a) or (b) below is satisfied:

(a) in connection with such Termination Transaction all Limited Partners
either will receive, or will have the right to elect to receive, for each
Common Unit an amount of cash, securities, or other property equal to the
product of the REIT Shares Amount and the greatest amount of cash, securities
or other property paid to a holder of one REIT Share in consideration of one
REIT Share in connection with the Termination Transaction; _provided_ , _that_
, if, in connection with the Termination Transaction, a purchase, tender or
exchange offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of more
than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding REIT Shares, each Holder of Common
Units shall receive, or shall have the right to elect to receive, the
greatest amount of cash, securities, or other property which such holder would
have received had it exercised its right to Redemption (as set forth in
_Section 8.6_) and received REIT Shares in exchange for its Common Units
immediately prior to the expiration of such purchase, tender or exchange offer
and had thereupon accepted such purchase, tender or exchange offer and then
such Termination Transaction shall have been consummated; or

 

(b) the following conditions are met: (i) substantially all of the assets
directly or indirectly owned by the surviving entity are held directly or
indirectly by the Partnership or another limited partnership or limited
liability company which is the survivor of a merger, consolidation or
combination of assets with the Partnership (in each case, the "
_Surviving Partnership_ "); (ii) the holders of Common-Equivalent Units own a
percentage interest of the Surviving Partnership based on the relative fair
market value of the net assets of the Partnership and the other net assets of
the Surviving Partnership immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction; (iii) the rights, preferences and privileges of such holders in
the Surviving

 



78  Partnership are at least as favorable as those in effect immediately prior
to the consummation of such transaction and as those applicable to any other
limited partners or non-managing members of the Surviving Partnership; and
(iv) such rights of the Limited Partners include at least one of the
following: (a) the right to redeem their interests in the Surviving
Partnership for the consideration available to such persons pursuant to
_Section 11.2.B(a)_ ; or (b) the right to redeem their Common Units for cash
on terms equivalent to those in effect with respect to their Common Units
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction, or, if the
ultimate controlling person of the Surviving Partnership has publicly traded
common equity securities, such common equity securities, with an exchange
ratio based on the determination of relative fair market value of such
securities and the REIT Shares.

Section 11.3 _Limited Partners  Rights to Transfer_

 

A. Prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Date, no
Limited Partner shall transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest
to any transferee without the consent of the General Partner, which consent
may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, or exercise its right of
Redemption set forth in _Section 8.6_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
Limited Partner may, at any time (whether prior to or after such twelve (12)
month anniversary), without the consent of the General Partner, other than by
way of exercise of the right of Redemption set forth in  _Section 8.6_, (i)
transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to the General
Partner, (ii) transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to an
Immediate Family Member, subject to the provisions of  _Section 11.6_, (iii)
transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to a trust for the
benefit of a charitable beneficiary or to a charitable foundation, subject to
the provisions of _Section 11.6_, and (iv) subject to the provisions of
_Section 11.6_, pledge (a " _Pledge_ ") all or any portion of its Partnership
Interest to a lending institution, which is not an Affiliate of such Limited
Partner, as collateral or security for a bona fide loan or other extension of
credit with a scheduled maturity date not sooner than the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Effective Date, and transfer such pledged Partnership
Interest to such lending institution in connection with the exercise of
remedies under such loan or extension or credit, and the transfer of such
pledged Partnership Interest by the lender to any transferee. After such
twelve (12) month anniversary, each Limited Partner or Assignee (resulting
from a transfer made pursuant to clauses (i)-(iv) of the proviso of the
preceding sentence) shall have the right to transfer all or any portion of its
Partnership Interest, subject to the provisions of Section 11.6 and
the satisfaction of each of the following conditions (in addition to the
right of each such Limited Partner or Assignee (A) to continue to make any
such transfer permitted by clauses (i)-(iv) of such proviso or (B) to make any
transfer to its Affiliates or members, in each case, without satisfying
condition (1) below):

(1) _General Partner Right of First Refusal_. The transferring Partner shall
give written notice of the proposed transfer to the General Partner, which
notice shall state (i) the identity of the proposed transferee, and (ii) the
amount and type of consideration proposed to be received for the transferred
Partnership Units. The General Partner shall have ten (10) days upon which to
give the transferring Partner notice of its election to acquire the
Partnership Units on the proposed terms. If it so elects, it shall purchase
the Partnership Units on such terms within ten (10) days after giving notice
of such election. If it does not so elect, the transferring Partner may
transfer such Partnership Units to a third party, on economic terms no more
favorable to the transferee than the proposed terms, subject to the other
conditions of this _Section 11.3_.

 



79 (2) _Qualified Transferee_. Any transfer of a Partnership Interest shall be
made only to Qualified Transferees.

It is a condition to any transfer otherwise permitted hereunder that the
transferee assumes by operation of law or express agreement all of the
obligations of the transferor Limited Partner under this Agreement with
respect to such transferred Partnership Interest and no such transfer (other
than pursuant to a statutory merger or consolidation wherein all obligations
and liabilities of the transferor Partner are assumed by a successor
corporation by operation of law) shall relieve the transferor Partner of its
obligations under this Agreement without the approval of the General Partner,
in its reasonable discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee
of any transferred Partnership Interest shall be subject to any and all
ownership limitations contained in the Charter, which may limit or restrict
such transferees ability to exercise its Redemption rights, and to the
representations in _Section_ __ _ 3.4_. Any transferee, whether or not
admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, shall take subject to the
obligations of the transferor hereunder. Unless admitted as a Substituted
Limited Partner in accordance with _Section 11.4.B_ , no transferee, whether
by a voluntary transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, shall have any
rights hereunder, other than the rights of an Assignee as provided in and in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 11.5_.

B. If a Limited Partner is subject to Incapacity, the
executor, administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator, or
receiver of such Limited Partners estate shall have all the rights of a
Limited Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other Limited
Partners, for the purpose of settling or managing the estate, and such power
as the Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to transfer all or any part of
his or its interest in the Partnership. The Incapacity of a Limited Partner,
in and of itself, shall not dissolve or terminate the Partnership.

C. The General Partner may prohibit any transfer otherwise permitted under
_Section 11.3_ by a Limited Partner of his or her Partnership Units if, in
the opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership, such transfer would require
the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act by the
Partnership or would otherwise violate any federal or state securities laws
or regulations applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Units.

Section 11.4 _Substituted Limited Partners_

 

A. No Limited Partner shall have the right to substitute a transferee as a
Limited Partner in his or her place (including any transferee permitted by
_Section 11.3_). The General Partner shall, however, have the right to
consent to the admission of a transferee of the interest of a Limited Partner
pursuant to this _Section 11.4_ as a Substituted Limited Partner, which
consent may be given or withheld by the General Partner in its sole and
absolute discretion. The General Partners failure or refusal to permit a
transferee of any such interests to become a Substituted Limited Partner shall
not give rise to any cause of action against the Partnership or any Partner.

B. A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner
in accordance with this _Article 11_ shall have all the rights and powers and
be subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under
this Agreement. The admission of any transferee as a Substituted Limited
Partner shall be subject to the transferee executing and delivering to the
Partnership an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement

 



80  (including without limitation, the provisions of _Section 2.4_ and such
other documents or instruments as may be required to effect the admission,
each in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner) and the
acknowledgment by such transferee that each of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.4_ are true and correct with respect to
such transferee as of the date of the transfer of the Partnership Interest to
such transferee and will continue to be true to the extent required by such
representations and warranties.

 

C. Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner, the General Partner
shall amend _Exhibit A_ to reflect the name, address, number of Partnership
Units, and Percentage Interest of such Substituted Limited Partner and to
eliminate or adjust, if necessary, the name, address and interest of the
predecessor of such Substituted Limited Partner.

 

Section 11.5 _Assignees_

If the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, does not consent
to the admission of any permitted transferee under _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ as a
Substituted Limited Partner, as described in  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_, such
transferee shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement. An
Assignee shall be entitled to all the rights of an assignee of a limited
partnership interest under the Act, including the right to receive
distributions from the Partnership and the share of Net Income, Net Losses,
gain and loss attributable to the Partnership Units assigned to such
transferee, the rights to transfer the Partnership Units provided in this
_Article 11_ and the right of Redemption provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_,
but shall not be deemed to be a Holder of Partnership Units for any other
purpose under this Agreement, and shall not be entitled to effect a Consent
with respect to such Partnership Units on any matter presented to the Limited
Partners for approval (such Consent remaining with the transferor Limited
Partner). In the event any such transferee desires to make a further
assignment of any such Partnership Units, such transferee shall be subject to
all the provisions of this _Article 11_ to the same extent and in the same
manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of Partnership
Units. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
as a condition to becoming an Assignee, any prospective Assignee must first
execute and deliver to the Partnership an acknowledgment that each of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ are true
and correct with respect to such prospective Assignee as of the date of the
prospective assignment of the Partnership Interest to such prospective
Assignee and will continue to be true to the extent required by such
representations or warranties.

Section 11.6 _General Provisions_

 

A. No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as a result
of (i) a permitted transfer of all of such Limited Partners Partnership
Units in accordance with this _Article 11_ and the transferee(s) of such
Partnership Units being admitted to the Partnership as a Substituted Limited
Partner or (ii) pursuant to the exercise of its right of Redemption of all of
such Limited Partners Partnership Units under _Section 8.6_; _provided_
_that_ after such transfer, exchange or redemption such Limited Partner owns
no Partnership Interest.

 

B. Any Limited Partner who shall transfer all of such Limited Partners
Partnership Units in a transfer permitted pursuant to this  _Article 11_
where such transferee was admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner or
pursuant to the exercise of its rights of Redemption of all of such Limited
Partners Partnership Units under _Section 8.6_ shall cease to be a Limited
Partner; _provided_ _that_ after such transfer, exchange or redemption such
Limited Partner owns no Partnership Interest.

 



81 C. Transfers pursuant to this _Article 11_ may only be made on the first day
of a fiscal quarter of the Partnership, unless the General Partner otherwise
agrees.

D. If any Partnership Interest is transferred, assigned or redeemed during
any quarterly segment of the Partnerships Partnership Year in compliance with
the provisions of this _Article 11_ or transferred, redeemed or converted
pursuant to _Sections 8.6_ , _21.4_ , _21.8_ ,  _22.4,_ _22.8_ , _23.4_ ,
_23.8_ , _24.4_ or _24.8_ on any day other than the first day of a Partnership
Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each item thereof and all other items
attributable to such Partnership Interest for such Partnership Year shall be
divided and allocated between the transferor Partner and the transferee
Partner by taking into account their varying interests during the Partnership
Year using a method selected by the General Partner that is in accordance
with the Code. Except as otherwise agreed by the General Partner, all
distributions of Available Cash with respect to which the Partnership Record
Date is before the date of such transfer, assignment, exchange or
redemption shall be made to the transferor Partner, and all distributions of
Available Cash thereafter, in the case of a transfer or assignment other than
a redemption, shall be made to the transferee Partner.

 

E. In addition to any other restrictions on transfer herein contained,
including without limitation the provisions of this _Article 11_  and
_Section 2.6_, in no event may any transfer or assignment of a Partnership
Interest by any Partner (including pursuant to a Redemption or exchange for
REIT Shares by the Partnership or the General Partner) be made (i) to
any person or entity who lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own a
Partnership Interest; (ii) in violation of applicable law; (iii) except with
the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
and absolute discretion, of any component portion of a Partnership Interest,
such as the Capital Account, or rights to distributions, separate and apart
from all other components of a Partnership Interest; (iv) except with the
consent of the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
and absolute discretion, if in the opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership
such transfer could cause a termination of the Partnership for federal or
state income tax purposes (except as a result of the Redemption or exchange
for REIT Shares of all Common Units held by all Limited Partners or pursuant
to a transaction expressly permitted under _Section 11.2_); (v) if in the
opinion of counsel to the Partnership such transfer could cause the
Partnership to cease to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes (except as a result of the Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares of
all Common Units held by all Limited Partners); (vi) if such transfer could,
in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, cause the Partnership to become,
with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA,
a "party-in-interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a
"disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e) of the Code); (vii)
if such transfer could, in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, cause
any portion of the assets of the Partnership to constitute assets of any
employee benefit plan pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations Section
2510.2-101; (viii) if such transfer requires the registration of such
Partnership Interest pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities
laws; (ix) except with the consent of the General Partner, which may be given
or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, if such transfer (1) could be
treated as effectuated through an "established securities market" or a
"secondary market" (or the 

 



82  substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the
Code, (2) could cause the Partnership to become a "Publicly Traded
Partnership," as such term is defined in Sections 469(k)(2) or 7704(b) of the
Code, (3) could be in violation of _Section 3.4.E(5)_ , or (4) could cause the
Partnership to fail one or more of the Safe Harbors (as defined below); (x) if
such transfer subjects the Partnership to be regulated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, each as amended; (xi) except with the
consent of the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
discretion, if the transferee or Assignee of such Partnership Interest is
unable to make the representations set forth in _Section 3.4.C_ ; (xii) if
such transfer is made to a lender to the Partnership or any Person who is
related (within the meaning of Section 1.752-4(b) of the Regulations) to any
lender to the Partnership whose loan constitutes a Nonrecourse Liability,
except with the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or
withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; and _provided_ , _that_ , as a
condition to granting such consent the lender may be required to enter into an
arrangement with the Partnership and the General Partner to redeem or
exchange for the REIT Shares Amount any Partnership Units in which a security
interest is held simultaneously with the time at which such lender would be
deemed to be a partner in the Partnership for purposes of allocating
liabilities to such lender under Section 752 of the Code; or (xiii) if in the
opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership such transfer could adversely
affect the ability of the General Partner to continue to qualify as a
REIT or, except with the consent of the General Partner, which may be given
or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, subject the General Partner
to any additional taxes under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code.

 

F. The General Partner shall monitor the transfers of interests in the
Partnership (including any acquisition of Common Units by the Partnership or
the General Partner) to determine (i) if such interests could be treated as
being traded on an "established securities market" or a "secondary market (or
the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of
the Code and (ii) whether such transfers of interests could result in the
Partnership being unable to qualify for the "safe harbors" set forth in
Regulations Section 1.7704-1 (or such other guidance subsequently published
by the IRS setting forth safe harbors under which interests will not be
treated as "readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial
equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code) (the "
_Safe Harbors_ "). The General Partner shall have the authority (but shall not
be required) to take any steps it determines are necessary or appropriate in
its sole and absolute discretion to prevent any trading of interests which
could cause the Partnership to become a "publicly traded partnership," within
the meaning of Code Section 7704, or any recognition by the Partnership of
such transfers, or to insure that one or more of the Safe Harbors is met.

 



83 ARTICLE 12.

 

ADMISSION OF PARTNERS

Section 12.1  _Admission of Successor General Partner_

A successor to all of the General Partners General Partner Interest pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ who is proposed to be admitted as a successor
General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner,
effective upon such transfer. Any such transferee shall carry on the business
of the Partnership without dissolution. In each case, the admission shall be
subject to the successor General Partner executing and delivering to the
Partnership an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and such other documents or instruments as may be required to effect the
admission. In the case of such admission on any day other than the first day
of a Partnership Year, all items attributable to the General Partner Interest
for such Partnership Year shall be allocated between the transferring General
Partner and such successor as provided in _Article 11_.

Section 12.2 _Admission of Additional Limited Partners_

A. After the admission to the Partnership of the initial Limited Partners on
the date hereof, a Person who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership
in accordance with this Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an
Additional Limited Partner only upon furnishing to the General Partner (i)
evidence of acceptance in form satisfactory to the General Partner of all of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
power of attorney granted in _Section 2.4_ and (ii) such other documents or
instruments as may be required in the discretion of the General Partner in
order to effect such Persons admission as an Additional Limited Partner.

B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 12.2_, no
Person shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent
of the General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the General
Partners sole and absolute discretion. The admission of any Person as an
Additional Limited Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the
name of such Person is recorded on the books and records of the Partnership,
following the receipt of the Capital Contribution in respect of such Limited
Partner and the consent of the General Partner to such admission. If any
Additional Limited Partner is admitted to the Partnership on any day other
than the first day of a Partnership Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each
item thereof and all other items allocable among Partners and Assignees for
such Partnership Year shall be allocated among such Limited Partner and all
other Partners and Assignees by taking into account their varying interests
during the Partnership Year using a method selected by the General Partner
that is in accordance with the Code. Except as otherwise agreed to by the
Additional Limited Partners and the General Partner, all distributions of
Available Cash with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before
the date of such admission shall be made solely to Partners and Assignees
other than the Additional Limited Partner (other than in its capacity as an
Assignee) and all distributions of Available Cash thereafter shall be made to
all Partners and Assignees including such Additional Limited Partner.

Section 12.3 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership_

For the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall
take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Act to amend the records
of the Partnership and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practical an
amendment of this Agreement (including an amendment of _Exhibit A_ ) and, if
required by law, shall prepare and file an amendment to the Certificate and
may for this purpose exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 



84 ARTICLE 13.

 

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

Section 13.1  _Dissolution_

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited
Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
withdrawal of the General Partner, any successor General Partner (selected as
described in _Section 13.1.B_ below) shall continue the business of the
Partnership. The Partnership shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound
up, upon the first to occur of any of the following (each a " _Liquidating
Event_ "):

 

A. the expiration of its term as provided in _Section 2.5_;

 

B. an event of withdrawal of the General Partner, as defined in the Act,
unless, within 90 days after the withdrawal, all of the remaining Partners
agree in writing, in their sole and absolute discretion, to continue the
business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date
of withdrawal, of a substitute General Partner;

 

C. subject to compliance with _Section 11.2_ an election to dissolve the
Partnership made by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion;

D. entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to
the provisions of the Act;

 

E. any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership or a related series of transactions that, taken together,
result in the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Partnership;

F. the Incapacity of the General Partner, unless all of the remaining
Partners in their sole and absolute discretion agree in writing to continue
the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of a date
prior to the date of such Incapacity, of a substitute General Partner;

G. the Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares of all Partnership Interests
(other than those of the General Partner) pursuant to this Agreement; or

H. a final and non-appealable judgment is entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction ruling that the General Partner is bankrupt or insolvent, or a
final and non-appealable order for relief is entered by a court with
appropriate jurisdiction against the General Partner, in each case under any
federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency laws as now or hereafter in effect,
unless prior to the entry of such order or judgment all of the remaining
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to
the appointment, effective as of a date prior to the date of such order or
judgment, of a substitute General Partner.

 



85 Section 13.2 _Winding Up_

 

A. Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership shall continue
solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner,
liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors and
Partners. No Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or not
necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnerships business
and affairs. The General Partner (or, in the event there is no remaining
General Partner, any Person elected by a Majority in Interest of the Limited
Partners (the " _Liquidator_ ")) shall be responsible for overseeing the
winding-up and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of
the Partnerships liabilities and property and the Partnership property shall
be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value
thereof, and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by
the General Partner, include shares of stock in the General Partner) shall be
applied and distributed in the following order:

 

(1) First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to creditors other than the Partners;

 

(2) Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to the General Partner;

 

(3) Third, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to the other Partners; and

 

(4) The balance, if any, to the General Partner and Limited Partners in
accordance with their positive Capital Account balances, determined after
taking into account all Capital Account adjustments for all prior periods and
the Partnership taxable year during which the liquidation occurs (other than
those made as a result of the liquidating distribution set forth in this
_Section 13.2.A(4)_ ).

The General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this _Article 13_ other than reimbursement of
its expenses as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.2.A_ which require
liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of
priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the
Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all
of the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to
the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer
for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to
satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those Partners as
creditors) and/or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in
common and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 13.2.A_ , undivided
interests in such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for
liquidation. Any such distributions in-kind shall be made only if, in the good
faith judgment of the Liquidator, such distributions in-kind are in the best
interest of the Partners, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to
the disposition and management of such Properties as the Liquidator deems
reasonable and equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of
such Properties at such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair market
value of any property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of
valuation as it may adopt.

 



86 Section 13.3 _Capital Contribution Obligation_

 

If any Partner has a deficit balance in his or her Capital Account (after
giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for the
taxable years, including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such
Partner shall have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of
the Partnership with respect to such deficit, and such deficit at any time
shall not be considered a Debt owed to the Partnership or to any other Person
for any purpose whatsoever, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed to
by such Partner and the Partnership (for example, in a "deficit restoration
obligation agreement" or DRO).

Section 13.4 _Compliance with Timing Requirements of Regulations_

 

In the discretion of the Liquidator or the General Partner, a pro rata portion
of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the General Partner and
Limited Partners pursuant to this _Article 13_ may be:

(1) distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General Partner
and Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership assets,
collecting amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any contingent or
unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or of the General
Partner arising out of or in connection with the Partnership. The assets of
any such trust shall be distributed to the General Partner and Limited
Partners from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the Liquidator or
the General Partner, in the same proportions and the amount distributed to
such trust by the Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the
General Partner and Limited Partners pursuant to this Agreement; or

 

(2) withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion
of any installment obligations owed to the Partnership, _provided_ , _that_
such withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner
and Limited Partners in the manner and priority set forth in _Section 13.2.A_
as soon as practicable.

Section 13.5 _Deemed Distribution and Recontribution_

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article 13_ , in the event the
Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) but no Liquidating Event has occurred, the Partnerships
property shall not be liquidated, the Partnerships liabilities shall not be
paid or discharged, and the Partnerships affairs shall not be wound up.
Instead, the Partnership shall be deemed to have contributed all of its assets
and liabilities to a new partnership in exchange for an interest in the new
partnership. Immediately thereafter, the Partnership shall be deemed to
distribute interests in the new partnership to the General Partner and Limited
Partners in proportion to their respective interests in the Partnership in
liquidation of the Partnership.

 

Section 13.6 _Rights of Limited Partners_

 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Limited Partner shall
look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of his Capital
Contribution and shall have no right or power to demand or receive property
from the General Partner. No Limited Partner shall have priority over any
other Limited Partner as to the return of his Capital Contributions,
distributions or allocations. 

 



87 Section 13.7 _Notice of Dissolution_

 

In the event a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but for
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, result in a dissolution of the
Partnership, the General Partner shall, within 30 days thereafter, provide
written notice thereof to each of the Partners and to all other parties with
whom the Partnership regularly conducts business (as determined in
the discretion of the General Partner) and shall publish notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in each place in which the Partnership
regularly conducts business (as determined in the discretion of the General
Partner).

 

Section 13.8 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_

 

Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Partnership cash and property as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.2_, the Partnership shall be terminated and
the Certificate and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited
partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Maryland shall be
cancelled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the
Partnership shall be taken.

Section 13.9 _Reasonable Time for Winding-Up_

 

A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding-up of the business
and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 13.2_, in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant
upon such winding-up, and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
effect between the Partners during the period of liquidation.

Section 13.10 _Waiver of Partition_

 

Each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.

 

ARTICLE 14.

AMENDMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT; CONSENTS

Section 14.1 _Amendments_

 

A. The actions requiring consent or approval of the Partners or of the Limited
Partners pursuant to this Agreement, including  _Section 7.3_, or otherwise
pursuant to applicable law, are subject to the procedures in this _Article
14_.

B. Amendments to this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of Limited
Partners may be proposed by the General Partner or by Limited Partners holding
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Partnership Interests held by Limited
Partners. The General Partner shall seek the written consent of the Limited
Partners on the proposed amendment or shall call a meeting to vote thereon and
to transact any other business that it may deem appropriate. For purposes of
obtaining a written consent, the General Partner may require a response
within a reasonable specified time, but not less than 15 days, and failure to
respond in such time period shall constitute a consent which is consistent
with the General Partners recommendation (if so recommended) with respect to
the proposal; _provided_ , _that_ , an action shall become effective at such
time as requisite consents are received even if prior to such specified time.

 



88 Section 14.2 _Action by the Partners_

 

A. Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner and shall be
called upon the receipt by the General Partner of a written request by
Limited Partners holding twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Partnership
Interests held by Limited Partners. The notice shall state the nature of the
business to be transacted. Notice of any such meeting shall be given to
all Partners not less than seven days nor more than 30 days prior to the date
of such meeting. Partners may vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.
Whenever the vote or Consent of the Limited Partners or of the Partners is
permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote or Consent may be given
at a meeting of Partners or may be given in accordance with the procedure
prescribed in _Section 14.1_.

 

B. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Partners
may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the action
so taken is signed by the percentage as is expressly required by this
Agreement for the action in question. Such consent may be in one instrument or
in several instruments, and shall have the same force and effect as a vote of
the Percentage Interests of the Partners (expressly required by this
Agreement). Such consent shall be filed with the General Partner. An action so
taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on the effective
date so certified.

 

C. Each Limited Partner may authorize any Person or Persons to act for him by
proxy on all matters in which a Limited Partner is entitled to participate,
including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a
meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the Limited Partner or his attorney-in-
fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date
thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable
at the pleasure of the Limited Partner executing it.

 

D. Each meeting of Partners shall be conducted by the General Partner or such
other Person as the General Partner may appoint pursuant to such rules for
the conduct of the meeting as the General Partner or such other Person deems
appropriate.

E. On matters on which Limited Partners are entitled to vote, each Limited
Partner shall have a vote equal to the number of Partnership Units held.

A.  _Payment of Distributions_. Subject to the rights of Holders of Parity

the General Partner, as holder of the Series C Preferred Units, will be

dates specified in this sentence and not calendar quarters) in arrears, on
the last calendar day of March, June, September and December, of each year
commencing on [], 2017, and, (ii), in the event of a redemption of Series C

next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other
payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in
the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and
effect as if made on such date.

 

B. _Distributions Cumulative_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions on
the Series C Preferred Units will accrue whether or not the terms and
provisions set forth in _Section 21.2.C_ at any time prohibit the current
payment of distributions, whether or not the Partnership has earnings, whether
or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such
distributions and whether or not such distributions are authorized.

 



95 C. _Priority as to Distributions_

 

(1) Except as provided in _Section 21.2.C(2)_ below, no distributions shall be

liquidation) for any period, nor shall any Junior Units or Parity Preferred
Units as to distributions or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired for any consideration (and no funds shall be paid or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such units) and no other
distribution of cash or other property may be made, directly or indirectly, on
or with respect thereto by the Partnership (except by conversion into or
exchange for Junior Units as to distributions and upon liquidation, and
except for the redemption of Partnership Interests corresponding to any REIT
Series C Preferred Shares or any other REIT shares of any other class or
series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends or upon liquidation, on
parity with or junior to the REIT Series C Preferred Shares to be purchased
by the General Partner pursuant to the Charter to the extent necessary to
preserve the General Partners status as a real estate investment trust,
_provided_ that such redemption shall be upon the same terms as the
corresponding stock purchase pursuant to the Charter), unless full cumulative
distributions on the Series C Preferred Units for all past periods shall have
been or contemporaneously are (i) declared and paid in cash or (ii) declared
and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set apart for such
payment.

 

(2) When distributions are not paid in full (and a sum sufficient for such
full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series C Preferred Units and any
other Parity Preferred Units as to distributions, all distributions declared
upon the Series C Preferred Units and such other classes or series of Parity
Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions shall be declared pro rata
so that the amount of distributions declared per Series C Preferred Unit and
each such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units shall in all cases
bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per Series C
Preferred Unit and such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units
(which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid distributions on
such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units for prior distribution
periods if such other class or series of Parity Preferred Unit does not have
a cumulative distribution) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in
lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or
payments on the Series C Preferred Units which may be in arrears.

D. _No Further Rights_. The General Partner, as holder of the Series C
Preferred Units, shall not be entitled to any distributions, whether payable
in cash, other property or otherwise, in excess of the full cumulative
distributions described herein. Any distribution payment made on the Series C
Preferred Units shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid distribution due with respect to such Series C Preferred Units which
remains payable. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series C Preferred
Units will accumulate as of the Series C Preferred Unit Distribution Payment
Date on which they first become payable.

or assets of the Partnership to, or the consolidation or merger or other
business combination of the Partnership with or into, any corporation, trust
or other entity (or of any corporation, trust or other entity with or into

Section 21.4 _Redemption_

A.  _Redemption_. If the General Partner elects to redeem any of the REIT
Series C Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms of the Series C
Articles Supplementary, the Partnership shall, on the date set for redemption

Preferred Units equal to the number of REIT Series C Preferred Shares for
which the General Partner has given notice of redemption pursuant to _Section
5_ of _Article SECOND_ the Series C Articles Supplementary, at a redemption
price, payable in cash, equal to the product of (i) the number of Series C
Preferred Units being redeemed, and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of $25,
any Preferred Distribution Shortfall per Series C Preferred Unit, and any
accrued and unpaid distribution per Series C Preferred Unit for the current
distribution period.

(1) Notice of redemption will be given by the General Partner to the
Partnership concurrently with the notice of the General Partner sent to the

redemption. Such notice shall state: (A) the redemption date; (B) the
redemption price; (C) the number of Series C Preferred Units to be redeemed;
(D) the place or places where the Series C Preferred Units are to be

(2) On or after the redemption date, the General Partner shall present and
surrender the certificates, if any, representing the Series C Preferred Units
to the Partnership at the place designated in the notice of redemption and
thereupon the redemption price of such Units (including all accumulated and
unpaid distributions up to but excluding the redemption date) shall be paid to
the General Partner and each surrendered Unit certificate, if any, shall be
canceled. If fewer than all the Units represented by any such
certificate representing Series C Preferred Units are to be redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed Units.

 



97 (3) From and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership defaults in
payment of the redemption price), all distributions on the Series C Preferred
Units designated for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and
all rights of the General Partner, except the right to receive the redemption
price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions up to but
excluding the redemption date), shall cease and terminate, and such Series C
Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. At its election, the Partnership, prior to a redemption date, may
irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid
distributions to but not including the redemption date) of the Series C
Preferred Units so called for redemption in trust for the General Partner
with a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to the
General Partner shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B) specify the

redemption date) against payment of the redemption price (including all

deposited which remain unclaimed by the General Partner at the end of two
years after the redemption date shall be returned by such bank or trust
company to the Partnership.

Section 21.5 _Ranking_

 

The Series C Preferred Units shall, with respect to distribution rights and

Partnership Units the terms of which provide that such Partnership Units
shall rank senior to the Series C Preferred Units.

Partnership concurrently with the notice of the General Partner sent to the
holders of its REIT Series G Preferred Shares in connection with such
redemption. Such notice shall state: (A) the redemption date; (B) the
redemption price; (C) the number of Series G Preferred Units to be redeemed;
(D) the place or places where the Series G Preferred Units are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (E) that distributions on the
Series G Preferred Units to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such
redemption date. If less than all of the Series G Preferred Units are to be
redeemed, the notice shall also specify the number of Series G Preferred Units
to be redeemed.

 



101 (2) On or after the redemption date, the General Partner shall present and
surrender the certificates, if any, representing the Series G Preferred Units
to the Partnership at the place designated in the notice of redemption and
thereupon the redemption price of such Units (including all accumulated and
unpaid distributions up to but excluding the redemption date) shall be paid
to the General Partner and each surrendered Unit certificate, if any, shall be
canceled. If fewer than all the Units represented by any such certificate
representing Series G Preferred Units are to be redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed Units.

(3) From and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership defaults in
payment of the redemption price), all distributions on the Series G Preferred
Units designated for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and
all rights of the General Partner, except the right to receive the redemption
price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions up to but
excluding the redemption date), shall cease and terminate, and such Series G
Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. At its election, the Partnership, prior to a redemption date, may
irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid
distributions to but not including the redemption date) of the Series G
Preferred Units so called for redemption in trust for the General Partner
with a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to the
General Partner shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B) specify the
office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the
redemption price and (C) require the General Partner to surrender the
certificates, if any, representing such Series G Preferred Units at such place
on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice (which may not be later
than the redemption date) against payment of the redemption price (including
all accumulated and unpaid distributions to the redemption date). Any monies
so deposited which remain unclaimed by the General Partner at the end of two
years after the redemption date shall be returned by such bank or trust
company to the Partnership.

Section 22.5 _Ranking_

 

The Series G Preferred Units shall, with respect to distribution rights and
rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of
the Partnership, rank (i) senior to the Common Units and to all other
Partnership Units the terms of which provide that such Partnership Units shall
rank junior to the Series G Preferred Units; (ii) on a parity with all Parity
Preferred Units, including the Series C Preferred Units, the Series H
Preferred Units and the Series I Preferred Units; and (iii) junior to all
Partnership Units the terms of which provide that such Partnership Units
shall rank senior to the Series G Preferred Units.

Section 22.6 _Voting Rights_

 

The General Partner shall not have any voting or consent rights in respect of
its partnership interest represented by the Series G Preferred Units.

Section 22.7 _Transfer Restrictions_

 

The Series G Preferred Units shall not be transferable except in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 11.2_.

 



102 Section 22.8 _Conversion_

 

In the event of a conversion of REIT Series G Preferred Shares into REIT
Shares at the option of the holders of REIT Series G Preferred
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Series G Articles Supplementary, then,
upon conversion of such REIT Series G Preferred Shares, the General Partner
shall convert an equal whole number of Series G Preferred Units into Common
Units as such REIT Series G Preferred Shares are converted into REIT Shares,
as adjusted to take into account any changes to the REIT Shares Amount
pursuant to subparagraph (y) of the definition of REIT Shares Amount. In the
event of a conversion of REIT Series G Preferred Shares into REIT Shares, (a)
to the extent the General Partner is required to pay cash in lieu of
fractional REIT Shares pursuant to the Series G Articles Supplementary in
connection with such conversion, the Partnership shall distribute an equal
amount of cash to the General Partner; and (b) to the extent the General
Partner receives cash proceeds in addition to the REIT Series G Preferred
Shares tendered for conversion, the General Partner shall contribute
such proceeds to the Partnership.

Section 22.9 _No Sinking Fund_

 

No sinking fund shall be established for the retirement or redemption of
Series G Preferred Units.

 

ARTICLE 23.

SERIES H PREFERRED UNITS

Section 23.1 _Designation and Number_

 

A series of Partnership Units in the Partnership designated as the "7.375%
Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units" (the " _Series H Preferred
Units_ ") is hereby established, with the rights, priorities and preferences
set forth herein. The number of Series H Preferred Units shall be 15,800,000.

 

Section 23.2 _Distributions_

A.  _Payment of Distributions_. Subject to the rights of Holders of Parity
Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions, pursuant to Section 5.1,
the General Partner, as holder of the Series H Preferred Units, will be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Partnership acting
through the General Partner, out of Available Cash, cumulative preferential
cash distributions in an amount equal to the Series H Priority Return. Such
distributions shall be cumulative, shall accrue from the original date of
issuance and will be payable (i) quarterly (such quarterly periods for
purposes of payment and accrual will be the quarterly periods ending on the
dates specified in this sentence and not calendar quarters) in arrears, on
the last calendar day of March, June, September and December, of each year
commencing on June 30, 2014, and, (ii), in the event of a redemption of Series
H Preferred Units, on the redemption date (each a " _Series H Preferred Unit
Distribution Payment Date_ "). If any date on which distributions are to be
made on the Series H Preferred Units is not a Business Day, then payment of
the distribution to be made on such date will be made, at the General
Partners option, on either the immediately preceding business day or next
succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other
payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in
the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and
effect as if made on such date.

 



103 B. _Distributions Cumulative_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions on
the Series H Preferred Units will accrue whether or not the terms and
provisions set forth in _Section 23.2.C_ at any time prohibit the current
payment of distributions, whether or not the Partnership has earnings, whether
or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such
distributions and whether or not such distributions are authorized.

C. _Priority as to Distributions_

(1) Except as provided in _Section 23.2.C(2)_ below, no distributions shall be
declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment and no other
distribution of cash or other property may be declared and made on or with
respect to any Parity Preferred Unit or Junior Unit as to distributions (other
than a distribution paid in Junior Units as to distributions and upon
liquidation) for any period, nor shall any Junior Units or Parity Preferred
Units as to distributions or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired for any consideration (and no funds shall be paid or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such units) and no other
distribution of cash or other property may be made, directly or indirectly, on
or with respect thereto by the Partnership (except by conversion into or
exchange for Junior Units as to distributions and upon liquidation, and
except for the redemption of Partnership Interests corresponding to any REIT
Series H Preferred Shares or any other REIT shares of any other class or
series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends or upon liquidation, on
parity with or junior to the REIT Series H Preferred Shares to be purchased by
the General Partner pursuant to the Charter to the extent necessary to
preserve the General Partners status as a real estate investment trust, 
_provided_ that such redemption shall be upon the same terms as the
corresponding stock purchase pursuant to the Charter), unless full cumulative
distributions on the Series H Preferred Units for all past periods shall have
been or contemporaneously are (i) declared and paid in cash or (ii) declared
and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set apart for such
payment.

 

(2) When distributions are not paid in full (and a sum sufficient for such
full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series H Preferred Units and any
other Parity Preferred Units as to distributions, all distributions declared
upon the Series H Preferred Units and such other classes or series of Parity
Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions shall be declared pro rata
so that the amount of distributions declared per Series H Preferred Unit and
each such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units shall in all cases
bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per Series H
Preferred Unit and such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units
(which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid distributions on
such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units for prior distribution
periods if such other class or series of Parity Preferred Unit does not have
a cumulative distribution) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in
lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or
payments on the Series H Preferred Units which may be in arrears.

 



104 D. _No Further Rights_. The General Partner, as holder of the Series H
Preferred Units, shall not be entitled to any distributions, whether payable
in cash, other property or otherwise, in excess of the full cumulative
distributions described herein. Any distribution payment made on the Series H
Preferred Units shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid distribution due with respect to such Series H Preferred Units which
remains payable. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series H Preferred
Units will accumulate as of the Series H Preferred Unit Distribution Payment
Date on which they first become payable.

Section 23.3 _Liquidation Proceeds_

 

A. _Distributions_. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Partnership, distributions on the Series H Preferred
Units shall be made in accordance with _Article 13_.

B. _Notice_. Written notice of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Partnership, stating the payment date or
dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such
circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by the General Partner pursuant
to _Section 13.7_.

C. _No Further Rights_. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to which it is entitled, the General Partner, as holder of the
Series H Preferred Units, will have no right or claim to any of the remaining
assets of the Partnership. 

D. _Consolidation, Merger or Certain Other Transactions_. The voluntary sale,
conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock,
securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property
or assets of the Partnership to, or the consolidation or merger or other
business combination of the Partnership with or into, any corporation, trust
or other entity (or of any corporation, trust or other entity with or into
the Partnership) shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Partnership.

 

Section 23.4 _Redemption_

A.  _Redemption_. If the General Partner elects to redeem any of the REIT
Series H Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms of the Series H
Articles Supplementary, the Partnership shall, on the date set for redemption
of such REIT Series H Preferred Shares, redeem the number of Series H
Preferred Units equal to the number of REIT Series H Preferred Shares for
which the General Partner has given notice of redemption pursuant to _Section
5_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6_, as applicable, of _Article THIRD_ of the Series H
Articles Supplementary, at a redemption price, payable in cash, equal to the
product of (i) the number of Series H Preferred Units being redeemed,
and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of $25, any Preferred Distribution
Shortfall per Series H Preferred Unit, and any accrued and unpaid distribution
per Series H Preferred Unit for the current distribution period.

 

B. _Procedures for Redemption_. The following provisions set forth the
procedures for redemption:

 



105 (1) Notice of redemption will be given by the General Partner to the
Partnership concurrently with the notice of the General Partner sent to the
holders of its REIT Series H Preferred Shares in connection with such
redemption. Such notice shall state: (A) the redemption date; (B) the
redemption price; (C) the number of Series H Preferred Units to be redeemed;
(D) the place or places where the Series H Preferred Units are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (E) that distributions on the
Series H Preferred Units to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such
redemption date. If less than all of the Series H Preferred Units are to be
redeemed, the notice shall also specify the number of Series H Preferred Units
to be redeemed.

 

(2) On or after the redemption date, the General Partner shall present and
surrender the certificates, if any, representing the Series H Preferred Units
to the Partnership at the place designated in the notice of redemption and
thereupon the redemption price of such Units (including all accumulated and
unpaid distributions up to but excluding the redemption date) shall be paid to
the General Partner and each surrendered Unit certificate, if any, shall be
canceled. If fewer than all the Units represented by any such certificate
representing Series H Preferred Units are to be redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed Units.

(3) From and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership defaults in
payment of the redemption price), all distributions on the Series H Preferred
Units designated for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and
all rights of the General Partner, except the right to receive the redemption
price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions up to but
excluding the redemption date), shall cease and terminate, and such Series H
Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. At its election, the Partnership, prior to a redemption date, may
irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid
distributions to but not including the redemption date) of the Series H
Preferred Units so called for redemption in trust for the General Partner with
a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to the General
Partner shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B) specify the office of
such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and
(C) require the General Partner to surrender the certificates, if any,
representing such Series H Preferred Units at such place on or about the date
fixed in such redemption notice (which may not be later than the redemption
date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and
unpaid distributions to the redemption date). Any monies so deposited which
remain unclaimed by the General Partner at the end of two years after the
redemption date shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the
Partnership.

Section 23.5 _Ranking_

 

The Series H Preferred Units shall, with respect to distribution rights and
rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of
the Partnership, rank (i) senior to the Common Units and to all other

rank junior to the Series H Preferred Units; (ii) on a parity with all Parity
Preferred Units, including the Series C Preferred Units, the Series G
Preferred Units and the Series I Preferred Units; and (iii) junior to all
Partnership Units the terms of which provide that such Partnership Units
shall rank senior to the Series H Preferred Units.

Shares at the option of the holders of REIT Series H Preferred Shares pursuant
to the terms of the Series H Articles Supplementary, then, upon conversion of
such REIT Series H Preferred Shares, the General Partner shall convert an
equal whole number of Series H Preferred Units into Common Units as such REIT
Series H Preferred Shares are converted into REIT Shares, as adjusted to take
into account any changes to the REIT Shares Amount pursuant to subparagraph
(y) of the definition of REIT Shares Amount. In the event of a conversion of
REIT Series H Preferred Shares into REIT Shares, (a) to the extent the General
Partner is required to pay cash in lieu of fractional REIT Shares pursuant to
the Series H Articles Supplementary in connection with such conversion, the
Partnership shall distribute an equal amount of cash to the General Partner;
and (b) to the extent the General Partner receives cash proceeds in addition
to the REIT Series H Preferred Shares tendered for conversion, the General
Partner shall contribute such proceeds to the Partnership.

Section 24.2 _Distributions_

A.  _Payment of Distributions_. Subject to the rights of Holders of Parity

107  cumulative, shall accrue from the original date of issuance and will be
payable (i) quarterly (such quarterly periods for purposes of payment and
accrual will be the quarterly periods ending on the dates specified in this
sentence and not calendar quarters) in arrears, on the last calendar day of

the redemption date (each a " _Series I Preferred Unit Distribution Payment
Date_ "). If any date on which distributions are to be made on the Series I
Preferred Units is not a Business Day, then payment of the distribution to be
made on such date will be made, at the General Partners option, on either the
immediately preceding business day or next succeeding day that is a Business
Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay)
except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year,
such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each
case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. With respect to
the Series I Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date occurring on December

declared by the Partnership acting through the General Partner, out of
Available Cash, a preferential cash distribution in an amount equal to
$795,638.65 (the "Series I Preferential Distribution Amount").

the Series I Preferred Units will accrue whether or not the terms and
provisions set forth in _Section 24.2.C_ at any time prohibit the current
payment of distributions, whether or not the Partnership has earnings, whether
or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such
distributions and whether or not such distributions are authorized.

C. _Priority as to Distributions_

 

(1) Except as provided in _Section 24.2.C(2)_ below, no distributions shall be
declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment and no other

liquidation) for any period, nor shall any Junior Units or Parity Preferred
Units as to distributions or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired for any consideration (and no funds shall be paid or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such units) and no other
distribution of cash or other property may be made, directly or indirectly, on
or with respect thereto by the Partnership (except by conversion into or
exchange for Junior Units as to distributions and upon liquidation, and
except for the redemption of Partnership Interests corresponding to any REIT
Series I Preferred Shares or any other REIT shares of any other class or
series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends or upon liquidation, on
parity with or junior to the REIT Series I Preferred Shares to be purchased
by the General Partner pursuant to the Charter to the extent necessary to
preserve the General Partners status as a real estate investment trust,
_provided_ that such redemption shall be upon the same terms as the
corresponding stock purchase pursuant to the Charter), unless full cumulative
distributions on the Series I Preferred Units for all past periods shall have
been or contemporaneously are (i) declared and paid in cash or (ii) declared
and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set apart for such
payment.

 



108 (2) When distributions are not paid in full (and a sum sufficient for such
full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series I Preferred Units and any
other Parity Preferred Units as to distributions, all distributions declared
upon the Series I Preferred Units and such other classes or series of Parity
Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions shall be declared pro rata
so that the amount of distributions declared per Series I Preferred Unit and
each such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units shall in all cases
bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per Series I
Preferred Unit and such other class or series of Parity Preferred Units (which
shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid distributions on such other
class or series of Parity Preferred Units for prior distribution periods if
such other class or series of Parity Preferred Unit does not have a cumulative
distribution) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of
interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments
on the Series I Preferred Units which may be in arrears.

D. _No Further Rights_. The General Partner, as holder of the Series I
Preferred Units, shall not be entitled to any distributions, whether payable
in cash, other property or otherwise, in excess of the full cumulative
distributions described herein. Any distribution payment made on the Series I
Preferred Units shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid distribution due with respect to such Series I Preferred Units which
remains payable. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series I Preferred
Units will accumulate as of the Series I Preferred Unit Distribution Payment
Date on which they first become payable.

Section 24.3 _Liquidation Proceeds_

 

A. _Distributions_. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Partnership, distributions on the Series I Preferred
Units shall be made in accordance with _Article 13_.

dissolution or winding-up of the Partnership, stating the payment date or
dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such
circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by the General Partner pursuant
to _Section 13.7_.

assets of the Partnership. 

D. _Consolidation, Merger or Certain Other Transactions_. The voluntary sale,
conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock,
securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property
or assets of the Partnership to, or the consolidation or merger or other
business combination of the Partnership with or into, any corporation, trust
or other entity (or of any corporation, trust or other entity with or into
the Partnership) shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Partnership.

 



109 Section 24.4 _Redemption_

 

A. Redemption. If the General Partner elects to redeem any of the REIT Series
I Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms of the Series I Articles
Supplementary, the Partnership shall, on the date set for redemption of such

equal to the number of REIT Series I Preferred Shares for which the General
Partner has given notice of redemption pursuant to _Section 5_ or _Section_
__ _ 6_, as applicable, of _Article THIRD_ of the Series I Articles
Supplementary, at a redemption price, payable in cash, equal to the product
of (i) the number of Series I Preferred Units being redeemed, and (ii) an

procedures for redemption:

(1) Notice of redemption will be given by the General Partner to the
Partnership concurrently with the notice of the General Partner sent to the

(2) On or after the redemption date, the General Partner shall present and
surrender the certificates, if any, representing the Series I Preferred Units
to the Partnership at the place designated in the notice of redemption and
thereupon the redemption price of such Units (including all accumulated and
unpaid distributions up to but excluding the redemption date) shall be paid to
the General Partner and each surrendered Unit certificate, if any, shall be
canceled. If fewer than all the Units represented by any such certificate
representing Series I Preferred Units are to be redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed Units.

(3) From and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership defaults in
payment of the redemption price), all distributions on the Series I Preferred
Units designated for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and
all rights of the General Partner, except the right to receive the redemption
price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions up to but
excluding the redemption date), shall cease and terminate, and such Series I
Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. At its election, the Partnership, prior to a redemption date, may
irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid
distributions to but not including the redemption date) of the Series I
Preferred Units so called for redemption in trust for the General Partner with
a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to the General
Partner shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B) specify the office of

date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and

remain unclaimed by the General Partner at the end of two years after the
redemption date shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the
Partnership.

CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP DEFINITION

 

The term "Constructively Owns" means ownership determined through the
application of the constructive ownership rules of Section 318 of the Code,
as modified by Section 856(d)(5) of the Code. Generally, these rules provide
the following:

a. an individual is considered as owning the Ownership Interest that is
owned, actually or constructively, by or for his spouse, his children, his
grandchildren, and his parents;

 

b. an Ownership Interest that is owned, actually or constructively, by or for
a partnership, limited liability company or estate is considered as owned
proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries;

c. an Ownership Interest that is owned, actually or constructively, by or for
a trust is considered as owned by its beneficiaries in proportion to the
actuarial interest of such beneficiaries ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of a "grantor trust" the Ownership Interest will be considered as
owned by the grantors);

d. if ten (10) percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation is
owned, actually or constructively, by or for any person, such person shall be
considered as owning the Ownership Interest that is owned, actually or
constructively, by or for such corporation in that proportion which the value
of the stock which such person so owns bears to the value of all the stock in
such corporation;

e. an Ownership Interest that is owned, actually or constructively, by or for
a partner or member which actually or constructively owns a 25% (except 5%
for purposes of Section 3.4.E.(1)) or greater capital interest or profits
interest in a partnership or limited liability company, or by or to or for a
beneficiary of an estate or trust shall be considered as owned by the
partnership, limited liability company, estate, or trust (or, in the case of a
grantor trust, the grantors);

f. if ten (10) percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation is
owned, actually or constructively, by or for any person, such corporation
shall be considered as owning the Ownership Interest that is owned, actually
or constructively, by or for such person;

g. if any person has an option to acquire an Ownership Interest (including an
option to acquire an option or any one of a series of such options), such
Ownership Interest shall be considered as owned by such person;

h. an Ownership Interest that is constructively owned by a person by reason
of the application of the rules described in paragraphs (a) through (g) above
shall, for purposes of applying paragraphs (a) through (g), be considered as
actually owned by such person  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) an

 



C-1 Ownership Interest constructively owned by an individual by reason of
paragraph (a) shall not be considered as owned by him for purposes of again
applying paragraph (a) in order to make another the constructive owner of such
Ownership Interest, (ii) an Ownership Interest constructively owned by a
partnership, estate, trust, or corporation by reason of the application of
paragraphs (e) or (f) shall not be considered as owned by it for purposes of
applying paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) in order to make another the constructive
owner of such Ownership Interest, (iii) if an Ownership Interest may be
considered as owned by an individual under paragraphs (a) or (g), it shall be
considered as owned by him under paragraph (g), and (iv) for purposes of the
above described rules, an S corporation shall be treated as a partnership and
any stockholder of the S corporation shall be treated as a partner of such
partnership except that this rule shall not apply for purposes of determining
whether stock in the S corporation is constructively owned by any person. 

i. For purposes of the above summary of the constructive ownership rules, the
term "Ownership Interest" means the ownership of stock with respect to a
corporation and, with respect to any other type of entity, the ownership of an

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned officer of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (" _DFT_ "), in connection with the opinions as to certain tax
matters to be delivered by Hogan Lovells US LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP
pursuant to Sections 7.3(d) and 7.2(e), respectively, of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")* dated as of June [ 🌑 ], 2017, by
and among Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _DLR_ "),
Penguins REIT Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of DLR (" _DLR Merger Sub_ "), Digital Realty Trust, L.P., a
Maryland limited partnership (" _DLR OP_ "), Penguins OP Sub 2, LLC, a
Maryland limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of DLR OP ("
_Merger Sub GP_ ") and Penguins OP Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability
company and subsidiary of DLR OP and Merger Sub GP (" _DLR OP Merger Sub_ "),
DFT and DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership (" _DFT
OP_ "), and recognizing that said counsel will rely on this Officers
Certificate in delivering their opinions, hereby certifies and represents that
(i) the facts that relate to the Mergers and related transactions, as
described in the Merger Agreement and the Form S-4 filed in connection with
the Mergers, including the Joint Proxy Statement contained therein, each as
amended or supplemented through the date hereof, are true, correct, and
complete in all material respects, and (ii) the following statements and
representations stated herein are true, correct, and complete:



   1. | The Mergers will be consummated in compliance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the MGCL, the MRULPA
and the MLLCA. The Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents
described in the Form S-4 represent the entire understanding of DFT with
respect to the Mergers. None of the terms and conditions contained in
the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other 
---|--- 



   *  | Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and
shall be interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law
and regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (with
the understanding that, for clarity, the terms "DLR Merger Sub," "DFT OP,"
"DFT Common Stock" and "DFT Series C Preferred Stock" herein have the
respective meanings ascribed to "REIT Merger Sub," "Company Operating
Partnership," "Company Common Stock" and "Company Series C Preferred Stock" in
the Merger Agreement). Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section"
references contained herein refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. Hogan Lovells US LLP

 

Latham and Watkins LLP

      |  documents described in the Form S-4 have been or will be waived
or modified and each of the representations relating to the Mergers and
contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents
described in the Form S-4 is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered
into in connection therewith are the result of arms length negotiations. DFT
has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Mergers, in particular, to
combine the business operations of DLR and DFT. 
---|--- 



   2. | The fair market value of the DLR Common Stock plus any cash paid
in lieu of fractional shares (the " _Common Merger Consideration_ ") received
by each DFT common shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of the DFT Common Stock surrendered by such DFT common shareholder in
the Company Merger. No DFT common shareholder will retain any rights in the
DFT Common Stock transferred or cancelled pursuant to the Company Merger.  
---|--- 



   3. | The fair market value of the DLR Series C Preferred Stock (the "
_Preferred Merger Consideration_ ") received by each DFT preferred shareholder
will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the DFT Series C
Preferred Stock surrendered by such DFT preferred shareholder in the Company
Merger. No DFT preferred shareholder will retain any rights in the DFT Series
C Preferred stock transferred or cancelled pursuant to the Company Merger.  
---|--- 



   4. | The Continuity Value of the DLR Common Stock and DLR Series C
Preferred Stock (together, the " _DLR Capital Stock_ ") to be received by the
DFT shareholders in the Company Merger as of the Company Merger Effective
Time will be at least forty percent (40%) of the Total Merger Consideration.
For purposes of this Tax Representation Certificate: (a) (i) the " _Continuity
Value_ " of the DLR Common Stock to be received by the DFT
common shareholders in the Company Merger as of the Company Merger Effective
Time means the value of such number of shares of DLR Common Stock determined
by reference to the mean of the high and low selling prices of a share of DLR
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day before
the Merger Agreement was signed, as reported by The Wall Street Journal (or if
not so reported, as reported by such other reporting service as is reasonably
agreed to by the parties), and (ii) the " _Continuity Value_ " of the DLR
Series C Preferred Stock to be received by the DFT preferred shareholders in
the Company Merger as of the Company Merger Effective Time means the fair
market value of such number of shares of DLR Series C Preferred Stock, and
(b) " _Total Merger Consideration_ " means the sum of (i) the Continuity Value
of the DLR Common Stock and the DLR Series C Preferred Stock to be received by
the DFT shareholders as of the Company Merger Effective Time, and (ii) the
amount of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of DLR Common Stock to be
received by the DFT shareholders as of the Company Merger Effective Time. 
---|--- 
 



   5. | Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2007 through
the Company Merger Effective Time, DFT has been organized and has operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real
estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856\. 
---|---

    6. | Pursuant to the Company Merger, no holder of DFT Common Stock
will receive in exchange for DFT Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any
consideration other than the Common Merger Consideration, and no holder of
DFT Series C Preferred Stock will receive in exchange for DFT Series C
Preferred Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the
Preferred Merger Consideration. No DFT shareholder will retain any rights in
the DFT Common Stock or the DFT Series C Preferred Stock (together, the "
_DFT Capital Stock_ ") transferred or cancelled pursuant to the Company
Merger. To the knowledge of DFT, neither DLR nor any person related to DLR (as
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) (a " _DLR Related
Person_ ") has acquired DFT Capital Stock with consideration other than DLR
Capital Stock either directly or through any transaction, agreement or
arrangement with any other person. Neither DFT nor any person related (as
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4) but without regard to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)(i)(A)) to DFT has acquired DFT
Capital Stock prior to and in connection with the Company Merger or otherwise
as part of a plan of which the Company Merger is a part. DFT has not made
any distributions with respect to its stock prior to and in connection with
the Company Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Company Merger
is a part, other than regular, normal dividends or distributions made to all
holders of DFT Common Stock or DFT Series C Preferred Stock, respectively, on
the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions and,
if applicable, distributions or dividends permitted by Section 6.15 of the
Merger Agreement. To the knowledge of DFT, DLR has no plan or intention to,
after the Company Merger, pay a dividend or other distribution with respect to
any class of DLR Capital Stock to holders of such DLR Capital Stock who are
former stockholders of DFT other than regular, normal dividends or
distributions made to all holders of such DLR Capital Stock on the relevant
record date with respect to such dividends or distributions. 
---|--- 



   7. | To the knowledge of DFT, none of the DFT stockholders will cause
their shares of DLR Capital Stock issued in the Company Merger to be redeemed
or reacquired by DLR, or cause any DLR Related Person or any person acting as
an intermediary for DLR or such DLR Related Person to acquire such shares. For
purposes of this representation, the term "redeem," "reacquire" or "acquire"
includes a redemption, reacquisition or acquisition, as the case may be,
actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as
collars or put protection arrangements, which have the economic effect of a
transfer of the burdens, benefits or other aspects of ownership. 
---|--- 
 



   8. | No equity interests, or other rights or interests that could be
treated as equity interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in DFT are
outstanding except for DFT Capital Stock. 
---|--- 
 



   9. | The liabilities of DFT to be assumed by DLR or the Surviving
Entity (as determined under Section 357(d)) and the liabilities to which the
transferred assets of DFT are subject were incurred by DFT in the ordinary
course of its business. 
---|--- 
 



\- 3 - Hogan Lovells US LLP

    10. | DFT has owned more than 49% of DFT OP since October 24, 2007,
and since such date DFT OP has been engaged in the business of owning and
leasing data center facilities. Except in connection with the
Partnership Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, DFP OP has not sold,
transferred, or otherwise disposed of assets comprising its data center
facilities business other than in the ordinary course of business and has not
disposed of any such assets prior to or in connection with the Company
Merger. 
---|--- 



   11. | Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.3 of the Merger
Agreement, DLR, DFT and the shareholders of DFT will each pay their respective
expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 



   12. | There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between DLR (or
any of its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and DFT (or any of its
subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or will be settled
at a discount. 
---|--- 



   13. | DFT is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a "title 11 or
similar case" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A). 
---|--- 



   14. | Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the fair
market value of the assets of DFT will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus
the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.  
---|--- 



   15. | The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of DLR
Common Stock to DFT common shareholders is solely for the purpose of avoiding
the expense and inconvenience to DLR of issuing fractional shares and
does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Company Merger to DFT common
shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of DLR Common Stock will
not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the
Company Merger to DFT shareholders in exchange for their shares of DFT Capital
Stock. The fractional share interests of each DFT common shareholder will be
aggregated, and no DFT common shareholder, with the possible exception of
shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate
names, held jointly or held with multiple brokers, will receive cash in an
amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of DLR Common
Stock. 
---|--- 



   16. | None of the payments received (or to be received) by any
shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of DFT that are
designated as compensation will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any DFT Capital Stock held by such shareholder-employee or shareholder-
independent contractor; none of the shares of DLR Capital Stock received by
any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will
be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting
or similar arrangement or agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid)
to any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or
will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will
be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms length
for similar services. No portion of the Common Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Merger Consideration will be received by a DFT shareholder as a
creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than as a DFT shareholder.

    17. | The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein
represent the full and complete agreement among DLR, DLR Merger Sub, DLR OP,
Merger Sub GP, DLR OP Merger Sub, DFT and DFT OP regarding the Mergers,
and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Mergers other

DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _DFT_ "), and DuPont

recognizing that said counsel will rely on this Officers Certificate in

that relate to the Mergers and related transactions, as described in the
Merger Agreement and the Form S-4 filed in connection with the Mergers,
including the Joint Proxy Statement contained therein, each as amended or
supplemented through the date hereof, are true, correct, and complete in all
material respects, and (ii) the following statements and representations
stated herein are true, correct, and complete:



   1. | The Mergers will be consummated in compliance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the MGCL, the MRULPA
and the MLLCA. The Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents
described in the Form S-4 represent the entire understanding of DLR with
respect to the Mergers. None of the terms and conditions contained in
the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other 
---|--- 



   *  |

Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law and
regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (with
the understanding that, for clarity, the terms "DLR Merger Sub," "DFT OP,"
"DFT Common Stock" and "DFT Series C Preferred Stock" herein have the
respective meanings ascribed to "REIT Merger Sub," "Company Operating
Partnership," "Company Common Stock" and "Company Series C Preferred Stock"
in the Merger Agreement). Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section"
references contained herein refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

      |  documents described in the Form S-4 have been or will be waived
or modified and each of the representations relating to the Mergers and
contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents
described in the Form S-4 is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered
into in connection therewith are the result of arms length negotiations. DLR
has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Mergers, in particular, to
combine the business operations of DLR and DFT. In addition, the shares
issued to DFTs shareholders in the Company Merger will be issued by DLR. 
---|--- 



   2. | DLR Merger Sub was formed by DLR for the sole purpose of
participating in the Company Merger, and prior to the Company Merger, DLR
Merger Sub did not own any material assets, have any liabilities or assets
subject to any liabilities, or conduct any business activities. DLR Merger
Sub will be, at all times from the date of its formation until and including
the Company Merger Effective Time, disregarded as an entity separate from DLR
for United States federal income tax purposes. There is no plan for DLR
Merger Sub to issue additional interests of its equity to any person other
than DLR or for DLR to sell the equity interests of DLR Merger Sub that it
currently holds. 
---|--- 
 



   3. | The fair market value of the DLR Common Stock plus any cash paid
in lieu of fractional shares (the " _Common Merger Consideration_ ") received
by each DFT common shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of the DFT Common Stock surrendered by such DFT common shareholder in
the Company Merger. No DFT common shareholder will retain any rights in the
DFT Common Stock transferred or cancelled pursuant to the Company Merger.  
---|--- 



   4. | The fair market value of the DLR Series C Preferred Stock (the "
_Preferred Merger Consideration_ ") received by each DFT preferred shareholder
will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the DFT Series C
Preferred Stock surrendered by such DFT preferred shareholder in the Company
Merger. No DFT preferred shareholder will retain any rights in the DFT Series
C Preferred stock transferred or cancelled pursuant to the Company Merger.  
---|--- 



   5. |

The Continuity Value of the DLR Common Stock and DLR Series C Preferred Stock
(together, the " _DLR Capital Stock_ ") to be received by the DFT
shareholders in the Company Merger as of the Company Merger Effective Time
will be at least forty percent (40%) of the Total Merger Consideration. For
purposes of this Tax Representation Certificate: (a) (i) the " _Continuity
Value_ " of the DLR Common Stock to be received by the DFT common shareholders
in the Company Merger as of the Company Merger Effective Time means the value
of such number of shares of DLR Common Stock determined by reference to the
mean of the high and low selling prices of a share of DLR Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange on the last business day before the Merger Agreement
was signed, as reported by The Wall Street Journal (or if not so reported, as
reported by such other reporting service as is reasonably agreed to by the
parties), and (ii) the " _Continuity Value_ " of the DLR Series C Preferred
Stock to be received by the DFT preferred shareholders in the Company Merger
as of the Company Merger Effective Time means the fair market value of such
number of shares of DLR 

---|--- 
 



\- 2 - Latham and Watkins LLP

      |  Series C Preferred Stock, and (b) " _Total Merger
Consideration_ " means the sum of (i) the Continuity Value of the DLR Common
Stock and the DLR Series C Preferred Stock to be received by the DFT
shareholders as of the Company Merger Effective Time, and (ii) the amount of
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of DLR Common Stock to be received by
the DFT shareholders as of the Company Merger Effective Time.  
---|--- 



   6. | Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004 through
the end of the DLRs taxable year that includes the Company Merger, DLR has
been organized and has operated, and will continue to be organized and
operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as
a real estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section
856\. 
---|--- 
 



   7. | Pursuant to the Company Merger, no holder of DFT Common Stock will
receive in exchange for DFT Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any
consideration other than the Common Merger Consideration, and no holder of
DFT Series C Preferred Stock will receive in exchange for DFT Series C
Preferred Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the
Preferred Merger Consideration. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
none of DLR, a person related to DLR as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a " _DLR Related Person_ ") or the Surviving Entity,
will acquire DFT Common Stock for consideration other than the
Merger Consideration or DFT Series C Preferred Stock for consideration other
than the Preferred Merger Consideration, in each case, issued in connection
with the Company Merger. DLR has not acquired any DFT Common Stock or DFT
Series C Preferred Stock (together, the " _DFT Capital Stock_ ") in
connection with the Company Merger other than as acquired pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, and no DLR Related Person and no person acting as an
intermediary for DLR or such DLR Related Person has acquired any DFT Capital
Stock, other than as acquired pursuant to the Merger Agreement. None of DLR, a
DLR Related Person, or any person acting as an intermediary for DLR or such
DLR Related Person has any plan or intention to redeem, reacquire or acquire
any DLR Capital Stock issued in the Company Merger. For purposes of this
representation, "redeem," "reacquire" or "acquire" will include a redemption,
reacquisition or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance,
including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection
arrangements, which have the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens,
benefits, or other aspects of ownership. To the knowledge of DLR, prior to
and in connection with the Company Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of
which the Company Merger is a part, no dividend or other distribution has been
or will be made with respect to DFT Capital Stock, other than regular, normal
dividends or distributions made to all holders of DFT Common Stock or DFT
Series C Preferred Stock, respectively, on the relevant record date with
respect to such dividends or distributions or dividends permitted by Section
6.15 of the Merger Agreement. DLR has no plan or intention to, after the
Company Merger, pay a dividend or other distribution with respect to any class
of DLR Capital Stock to holders of such DLR Capital Stock who are former
stockholders of DFT other than regular, normal dividends or distributions
made to all holders of such DLR Capital Stock on the relevant record date with
respect to such dividends or distributions. 
---|---

    8. | Neither DLR nor the Surviving Entity has any plan or intention
to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of DFT or DFT OP except for
dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers and
successive transfers permitted under Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(k)(1). 
---|--- 



   9. | Neither DLR nor any DLR Related Person has any plan or intention
to redeem or otherwise reacquire (or cause to be redeemed or reacquired) any
of the DLR Capital Stock issued in the Company Merger (except for
possible purchases of such shares that may be made by DLR on the open market
as part of a repurchase program, which purchases and program satisfy the
requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701). For purposes of this
representation, the term "redeem," "reacquire" or "acquire" includes a
redemption, reacquisition or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in
substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put
protection arrangements, which have the economic effect of a transfer of the
burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership. 
---|--- 
 



   10. | DLR is in the business of owning and leasing data center
facilities. Following the Mergers, DLR or a member of its qualified group of
corporations (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)),
will continue DFT OPs "historic business" of owning and leasing data center
facilities and will use the assets comprising such business to conduct such
business. For purposes of the foregoing representation, DLR will be treated
as owning its proportionate share of DFTs historic business assets used in a
business conducted by DLR OP as long as members of DLRs "qualified group" own
an interest in DLR OP representing a significant interest in DLR OP that is
not less than one-third of the capital and profits interests of DLR OP. 
---|--- 
 



   11. | Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.3 of the Merger
Agreement, DLR, DFT and the shareholders of DFT will each pay their respective
expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 



   12. | There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between DLR (or
any of its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and DFT (or any of its
subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or will be settled
at a discount. To the knowledge of DLR, the Surviving Entity will not assume
any liability of any of DFTs shareholders in connection with the Company
Merger. 
---|--- 



   13. | Prior to the Mergers, neither DLR nor any corporation affiliated
with DLR owned, directly or indirectly, nor had DLR or any such affiliated
corporation owned, directly or indirectly, during the five years preceding
the Company Merger Effective Time, any shares of stock of DFT or securities,
options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to
acquire DFT stock or other securities issued by DFT. 
---|--- 
 



   14. | Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, to the
knowledge of DLR, the fair market value of the assets of DFT will exceed the
sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which
the assets are subject. 
---|--- 
 



\- 4 - Latham and Watkins LLP

    15. | The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of
DLR Common Stock to DFT common shareholders is solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to DLR of issuing fractional shares and
does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Company Merger to DFT common
shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of DLR Common Stock will
not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the
Company Merger to DFT shareholders in exchange for their shares of DFT Capital
Stock. The fractional share interests of each DFT common shareholder will be
aggregated, and no DFT common shareholder, with the possible exception of
shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate
names, held jointly or held with multiple brokers, will receive cash in an
amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of DLR Common
Stock. 
---|--- 



   16. | None of the payments received (or to be received) by any
shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of DFT that are
designated as compensation will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any DFT Capital Stock held by such shareholder-employee or shareholder-
independent contractor; to the knowledge of DLR, none of the shares of DLR
Capital Stock received by any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent
contractor was (or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any
employment, consulting or similar arrangement or agreement; and to the
knowledge of DLR, the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-
employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) for services
actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms length for similar services.
To the knowledge of DLR, no portion of the Common Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Merger Consideration will be received by a DFT shareholder as a
creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than as a DFT shareholder. 
---|--- 
 



   17. | DLR will satisfy the information reporting requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3 with respect to the Company Merger. 
---|--- 
 



   18. | The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein
represent the full and complete agreement among DLR, DLR Merger Sub, DLR OP,
Merger Sub GP, DLR OP Merger Sub, DFT and DFT OP regarding the Mergers,
and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Mergers other
than those expressly referred to or contemplated in the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 



   19. | DLR, DLR Merger Sub and, after the Company Merger, the Surviving
Entity will not, and will not cause any of their subsidiaries to, take any
position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or
any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of
the Company Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 
---|--- 
 



   20. | The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations
set forth herein on behalf of DLR.

Re: DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as tax counsel to DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the "Company") in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June [ 🌑 ], 2017 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among the Company, DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P., a
Maryland limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), Digital Realty
Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("DLR"), Penguins REIT Sub, LLC, a
Maryland limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLR
("Merger Sub"), Digital Realty Trust, L.P. a Maryland limited partnership
("DLR OP"), and Penguins OP Sub 2, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company
and wholly-owned subsidiary of DLR OP ("Merger Sub GP") and Penguins OP Sub,
LLC, a Maryland limited liability company ("OP Merger Sub") with respect
to the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub
surviving the merger, and certain other transactions. This opinion letter is
being delivered to you pursuant to Section 7.2(d) of the Merger Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Merger Agreement shall
have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise defined
herein.

Bases for Opinion

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (including proposed and temporary
Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in
court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative
rulings and practices of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"),
including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which
are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives
such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations
are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable),
which may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in
material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the
possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent
jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the United States
Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this
regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels
best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with
respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is
not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will
not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will
not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.

In rendering the following opinion, we have examined such statutes,
regulations, records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have
considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion, including but
not limited to (1) the registration statement on Form S-4, Registration No. [
🌑 ], initially filed by DLR with the Securities and Exchange Commission on [ 🌑
], 2017, as amended through the date hereof (together with the documents
incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the joint proxy
statement/prospectus (the "Joint Proxy Statement") included therein, (2) the
Merger Agreement, and (3) certain organizational documents of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries (those documents referred to in clauses (1)
through (3), the "Reviewed Documents").

 

The opinion set forth in this letter is premised on, among other things, the
written representations of the Company and the Operating Partnership,
contained in a letter to us dated as of the date hereof (the "Company
Management Representation Letter") and the written representations of DLR and
DLR OP, contained in a letter to us dated as of the date hereof (the "DLR
Management Representation Letter," _1_ / together with the Company
Management Representation Letter, the "Management Representation Letters").
Although we have discussed the Company Management Representation Letter with
the signatories thereto, for purposes of rendering our opinion, we have not
made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the
Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation Letters. We consequently
have relied upon the representations and statements of the Company, the
Operating Partnership, DLR and DLR OP as described in the Reviewed Documents
and the Management Representation Letters, and assumed that the information
presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is accurate and
complete in all material respects.

In this regard, we have assumed with your consent the following:

 

(1) that (A) all of the representations and statements as to factual matters
set forth in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation Letters
are true, correct and complete as of the date hereof, (B) any representation
or statement in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation
Letters made as a belief or made "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified
is true, correct and complete as of the date hereof, without such
qualification, (C) each agreement described in the Reviewed Documents is valid
and binding in accordance with its terms, and (D) each of the obligations of
the Company and its subsidiaries, as described in the Reviewed Documents, has
been or will be performed or satisfied in accordance with its terms;

 

(2) the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents,
the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the
conformity to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the
authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made;

 

(3) that any documents as to which we have reviewed only a form were or will
be duly executed without material changes from the form reviewed by us;

(4) that the Merger Agreement is valid and binding in accordance with its
terms;

 



    _1_ / | The DLR Management Representation Letter will cover: (i)
filing the final REIT return, (ii) sending the shareholder demand letters for
the final taxable year, and (iii) using the REIT savings provisions,
if required. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

 

[ 🌑 ], 2017

 

Page 3



 

(5) that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger
Agreement (including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and conditions
to the obligations of the parties without amendment, waiver, or breach
thereof); and

 

(4) that, from and after the date of this letter, the Company and DLR each
will comply with its representation contained in the respective Management
Representation Letter that it will utilize all appropriate "savings
provisions" (including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and
856(g) of the Code, and the provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the
Code (flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days
after the close of a calendar quarter, and all available deficiency dividend
procedures) available to the Company under the Code in order to correct any
violations of the applicable real estate investment trust ("REIT")
qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code to the full
extent the remedies under such provisions are available.

 

Any material variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the
documents that we have reviewed and upon which we have relied (including,
in particular, the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement, and the
Management Representation Letters) may adversely affect the conclusions stated
herein.

 

Opinion

Based upon, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth
herein, including, without limitation, the discussion in the next two
paragraphs below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with the Companys
taxable year that ended on December 31, 2007 through and including its
taxable year that ends on the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company has
been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.

 

The Companys qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code depends upon
the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through
actual quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity
of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed
under the Code, and upon the Company utilizing any and all appropriate
"savings provisions" (including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6),
856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section
856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets
within 30 days after the close of a calendar quarter, and all available
deficiency dividend procedures) available to the Company under the Code to
correct violations of specified REIT qualification requirements of Sections
856 and 857 of the Code. Our opinion set forth above does not foreclose
the possibility that the Company may have to utilize one or more of these
"savings provisions" in the future, which could require the Company to pay an
excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to
maintain its REIT qualification. We have not undertaken to review the
Companys compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the
Companys operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets,
the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share
ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the
Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.

 

This opinion letter addresses only the specific U.S. federal income tax
matters set forth above and does not address any other U.S. federal, state,
local or foreign legal or tax issues. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the proposed merger (the "
_Merger_ ") of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _DFT_
") with and into Penguins REIT Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company
and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the " _Merger Sub_ "), with the
Merger Sub surviving the Merger. The Merger will be consummated pursuant to
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June [ 🌑 ], 2017 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "). The Merger is described in the registration statement on
Form S-4 (Registration No. [ 🌑 ]) initially filed by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on [ 🌑 ], 2017, as amended through the
date hereof (the " _Form S-4_"), which includes the joint proxy
statement/prospectus relating to the Merger (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_
"). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings specified in the
Merger Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 

In acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the Merger, we have
participated in the preparation of the Merger Agreement, and pursuant to
Section 7.2(e) of the Merger Agreement, you have requested our opinion
regarding whether, on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions
set forth herein, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "). In rendering our opinion, we have examined and, with your
consent, are expressly relying upon (without any independent investigation or
review thereof) the truth and accuracy of the factual statements,
representations and warranties contained in (i) the Merger Agreement
(including any Exhibits and Schedules thereto), (ii) the Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) the respective tax representation letters of the
Company and of DFT delivered to us for purposes of this opinion (the "
_Officer s Certificates_"), and (iv) such other documents and corporate
records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our

In addition, we have assumed, with your consent, that:

 



     | 1. | Original documents (including signatures) are authentic, and
documents submitted to us as copies conform to the original documents, and
there has been (or will be by the Company Merger Effective Time) execution
and delivery of all documents where execution and delivery are prerequisites
to the effectiveness thereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The Merger will be consummated in the manner contemplated by,
and in accordance with the provisions of, the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4
and the Joint Proxy Statement, and the Merger will be effective under the
laws of the State of Maryland; 
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | All factual statements, descriptions and representations
contained in any of the documents referred to herein or otherwise made to us
are true, complete and correct in all respects and will remain true, complete
and correct in all respects up to and including the Company Merger Effective
Time, and no actions have been taken or will be taken which are inconsistent
with such factual statements, descriptions or representations or which make
any such factual statements, descriptions or representations untrue,
incomplete or incorrect at the Company Merger Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 



     | 4. | Any statements made in any of the documents referred to
herein "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified are true, complete and
correct in all respects and will continue to be true, complete and correct
in all respects at all times up to and including the Company Merger Effective
Time, in each case without such qualification; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 5. | The parties have complied with and, if applicable, will
continue to comply with, the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, the
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement.  
---|---|--- 

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

In addition to the matters set forth above, this opinion is subject to the
exceptions, limitations and qualifications set forth below.

 



     | 1. |

This opinion represents our best judgment regarding the application of United
States federal income tax laws arising under the Code, existing judicial
decisions, administrative regulations and published rulings and procedures,
but does not address all of the United States federal income tax consequences
of the Merger. We express no opinion as to United States federal, state,
local, foreign, or other tax consequences, other than as set forth herein. Our
opinion is not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and
there is no assurance that the

      |  Internal Revenue Service will not assert a contrary position.
Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial or
administrative changes, on either a prospective or retroactive basis, would
not adversely affect the accuracy of the conclusions stated herein.
Nevertheless, we undertake no responsibility to advise you of any new
developments in the application or interpretation of the United States federal
income tax laws.

     | 2. | No opinion is expressed as to any transaction other than the
Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, or to any transaction whatsoever,
including the Merger, if, to the extent relevant to our opinion, either all
the transactions described in the Merger Agreement are not consummated in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and without waiver or breach
of any provisions thereof or all of the factual statements, representations,
warranties and assumptions upon which we have relied are not true and
accurate at all relevant times.

     | Re: | _Digital Realty Trust, Inc._ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 7.3(c) of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of June [ 🌑 ], 2017 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")
by and among Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Penguins REIT Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company
and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (" _REIT Merger Sub_ "), Digital
Realty Trust, L.P. a Maryland limited partnership (the " _Operating
Partnership_ "), Penguins OP Sub 2, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company
and wholly-owned subsidiary of DLR OP (" _Merger Sub GP_ "), Penguins OP Sub,
LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and subsidiary of DLR OP and Merger
Sub GP (" _OP Merger Sub_ "), DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (" _DFT_ ") and DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P., a Maryland limited
partnership (" _DFT OP_ ") with respect to the merger of DFT with and into
REIT Merger Sub, with REIT Merger Sub surviving the merger, and certain other
transactions.

You have requested our opinion concerning the Companys election to be taxed
as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). This opinion is based on certain
assumptions and factual representations concerning the business, assets
and governing documents of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their
subsidiaries as set forth in a registration statement on Form S-4,
Registration No. [ 🌑 ], initially filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on [ 🌑 ], 2017, as amended through the date hereof
(together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
including the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_
") included therein. We have also been furnished with, and with your consent
have relied upon, (i) certain representations made by the Company, the
Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries with respect to certain factual
matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company, and (ii) certain
representations made by DFT, DFT OP and their subsidiaries with respect to
certain factual matters through a certificate of an officer of DFT, each dated
as of the date hereof (together, the " _Officer s Certificates_"). [ 🌑 ], 2017

   ![LOGO](g396176g0609044223235.jpg) 



 

In our capacity as tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and
factual examinations and inquiries, including an examination of originals or
copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such
documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary
or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. For the purposes of our opinion,
we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth
in the above referenced documents or in the Officers Certificates. In
addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of
all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to
knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification. In our examination,
we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of
natural persons executing such documents and the conformity to authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.

 

We are opining herein only as to the federal income tax laws of the United
States, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto,
or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, the laws of any state or other
jurisdiction, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other
local agencies within any state.

 

Based on such facts, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions,
representations and limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion that: 



     | 1. | Commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2004,
through the Companys taxable year ending December 31, 2016, the Company has
been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The Companys proposed method of operation will enable it to
meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code
for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2017 and subsequent taxable years. 
---|---|--- 

No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed herein.

 

This opinion is rendered to you as of the date of this letter, and we
undertake no obligation to update this opinion subsequent to the date hereof.
This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated
thereunder and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the
courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to
change either prospectively or retroactively. Any such change may affect the
conclusions stated herein. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from
those set forth in the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Officers Certificates may affect the conclusions stated herein. As
described in the Joint Proxy Statement, the Companys qualification and
taxation as a REIT depend upon the Companys ability to meet the various
qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual annual
operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of
stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed
by Latham and Watkins LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the
actual results of the Companys operation for any particular taxable year will
satisfy such requirements. [ 🌑 ], 2017

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion letter is being delivered to you in connection with the proposed
merger (the " _Merger_ ") of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ ") with and into Penguins REIT Sub, LLC, a
Maryland limited liability company (" _DLR Merger Sub_ ") and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _Digital

Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June [ 🌑 ], 2017 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ ") by and among the Company, DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P., a
Maryland limited partnership (" _DFT OP_ "), Digital Realty Trust, DLR Merger
Sub, Digital Realty Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership (" _DLR OP_
"), and Penguins OP Sub 2, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and
wholly-owned subsidiary of DLR OP (" _Merger Sub GP_ "), and Penguins OP Sub,
LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and subsidiary of DLR OP and Merger
Sub GP (" _DLR OP Merger Sub_ "). This opinion letter is being delivered to
you pursuant to Section 7.3(d) of the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms
used herein and which are defined in the Merger Agreement shall have the
meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.

 

In connection with the preparation of this opinion letter, we have examined,
and with your consent relied upon, without any independent investigation
or review thereof, the following documents (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto): (1) the Merger Agreement; (2) the registration statement
on Form S-4 (Registration No. [ 🌑 ]) initially filed by Digital Realty Trust
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on [ 🌑 ], 2017, as amended through
the date hereof (the " _Form S-4_"), which includes the joint proxy
statement/prospectus relating to the Merger (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ");
(3) officers certificates delivered by each of the Company and Digital
Realty Trust to us for purposes of this opinion, both dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Tax Certificates_ "); and (4) such other instruments and
documents related to the formation, organization, and operation of the
Company and Digital Realty Trust or to the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby as we have deemed necessary or appropriate
(the documents described in clauses (1) through (4), collectively the "
_Reviewed Documents_ "). In addition, we have reviewed the form of opinion of
counsel to be delivered to Digital Realty Trust pursuant to Section 7.2(e) of
the Merger Agreement concurrently herewith (the " _DLR Opinion_ "). Board of Directors

Assumptions and Representations

 

In connection with rendering this opinion, we have assumed or obtained
representations (which with your consent we are relying upon, and upon which
our opinion is premised, without any independent investigation or review
thereof), including that:



     | 1. | (A) All information contained in each of the documents we
have examined and upon which we have relied in connection with the preparation
of this opinion is accurate and completely describes all material facts
relevant to our opinion, (B) all copies are accurate, (C) all signatures are
genuine, and (D) all documents have been or will be, as the case may be,
timely and properly executed. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 2. | There will have been, by the Company Merger Effective Time,
or at such other time as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, due execution
and delivery of all documents, where due execution and delivery are
prerequisites to the effectiveness thereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | To the extent relevant to our opinion, all representations,
warranties, and statements made or agreed to by Digital Realty Trust, DLR
Merger Sub, DLR OP, Merger Sub GP and DLR OP Merger Sub, and by the Company
and DFT OP, their respective managers, employees, officers, directors, and
stockholders in connection with the Merger, including, but not limited to,
those in the Reviewed Documents (including the Tax Certificates), have been
and will continue to be true, complete, and accurate in all respects; any
representation or statement made in the Tax Certificates "to the best of
knowledge," "to the knowledge," or "to the actual knowledge" of any person(s)
or party(ies)or similarly qualifiedis true, correct, and complete, as if
made without such qualification. 
---|---|--- 



     | 4. | The Merger Agreement is valid and binding in accordance with
its terms. The Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger
Agreement (including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and conditions

as a merger under the applicable laws of Maryland.

In addition to the assumptions set forth above, this opinion is subject to the
exceptions, limitations, and qualifications set forth below:



     | 1. | The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant
current provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including
proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the
foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history,
and the administrative rulings and practices of the IRS, including its
practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not
binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a
ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are
subject to change by the IRS, Congress, and the courts (as applicable), which
change may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in
material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the
possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent
jurisdiction, nor of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury
Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an
opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels best
professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect
to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not
binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not
assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not
sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. Neither the Company nor Digital
Realty Trust has requested or will request a ruling from the IRS as to any of
the U.S. federal income tax consequences addressed in this opinion.
Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial,
or administrative changes, including on a retroactive basis, would not
adversely affect the accuracy of the opinion expressed herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | This letter addresses only the specific tax opinion set forth
above. Our opinion does not address any other U.S. federal, state, local, or
non-U.S. tax consequences that will or may result from the Merger or any
other transaction (including any transaction undertaken in connection with the
Merger or contemplated by the Merger Agreement). 
---|---|--- 



      | 3. | Our opinion set forth herein is based upon, among other
things, the description of the contemplated transactions (including the
Merger) as set forth in the Merger Agreement. No opinion is expressed as to
any transaction other than those set forth in the Merger Agreement, or to any
transaction whatsoever, including the Merger, unless all the transactions
described in the Merger Agreement (or otherwise contemplated in connection
with the Merger) have been consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement (and also without amendment, waiver, or breach of any
provision thereof), and also unless all of the representations, warranties,
statements, and assumptions upon which we have relied are true, complete, and
accurate at all times. In the event that the actual facts relating to any
aspect of the relevant transactions (including the Merger) differ from the
terms of the Merger Agreement (without amendment, waiver, or breach of any
material provision thereof), or if any one of the representations,
warranties, statements, or assumptions upon which we have relied to issue this
opinion is incorrect, our opinion might be adversely affected and may not be
relied upon. 
---|---|--- 
 

This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with
the Merger and speaks as of the date hereof. We undertake no responsibility
by reason of this opinion letter or otherwise to advise you or any other
person of any changes in our opinion subsequent to the delivery of this
opinion letter. This opinion letter may not be relied on by any other person,
or for any other purpose, without our prior written consent, which may be
withheld in our sole discretion. This opinion letter may not be distributed,
quoted in whole or in part or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed
with any governmental agency without our prior written consent. Board of Directors
