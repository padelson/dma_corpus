an order of probation prior to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this <U>Section 7.7.A</U>. Any indemnification pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U> shall be made only
out of the assets of the Partnership, and any insurance proceeds from liability policies covering the General Partner and any Indemnitee, and neither the General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital

Opinion </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the
administrative rulings and practices of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;<B>IRS</B>&#148;), including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that
receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material
modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the United States Treasury Department in
regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&#146;s best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were
to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. </P>

qualifications set forth herein, including, without limitation, the discussion in the next two paragraphs below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with the Company&#146;s taxable year that ended on December&nbsp;31, 2007 through and including
its taxable year that ends on the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code depends upon the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual
quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, and upon the Company utilizing any and all appropriate &#147;savings provisions&#148;
(including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the close of a calendar quarter,
and all available deficiency dividend procedures) available to the Company under the Code to correct violations of specified REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. Our opinion set forth above does not foreclose the
possibility that the Company may have to utilize one or more of these &#147;savings provisions&#148; in the future, which could require the Company to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT
qualification. We have not undertaken to review the Company&#146;s compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company&#146;s operations, the sources of its income,
the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT. </P>

result in material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, nor of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in
regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&#146;s best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were
to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. Neither
the Company nor Digital Realty Trust has requested or will request a ruling from the IRS as to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences addressed in this opinion. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial, or
