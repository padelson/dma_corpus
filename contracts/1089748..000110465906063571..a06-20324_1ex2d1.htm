all respects upon:  

   

## 

  

### (i) the European Commission having issued a decision under Council
Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 (the " ** _Merger Regulation_** ") (or being
deemed to have done so under Article 10(6) of the Merger

with the common market and/or, if any aspect of the acquisition is referred

### (iii) either (a) no factual information that has not been fairly
disclosed in the Disclosure Letter or the Data Room or that has not been
delivered prior to the date hereof to the Purchasers Solicitors expressly in
the context of their review of the LDPE Technology Licence (such information
being referred to in this _Clause 2(a)(iii)_ as "new information") coming to
the attention of either the Vendor or the Purchaser which relates to the
period prior to the date hereof and which is relevant to the interpretation
of the LDPE Technology Licence (and for the avoidance of doubt, ExxonMobils
reaction, of itself (as opposed to any new information put forward as the
basis for, or in connection with such reaction), to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not be treated as a fact which is
relevant to the interpretation of the LDPE Technology Licence), or (b) if
such new information does come to the attention of the Vendor or the
Purchaser, the obtaining of an opinion pursuant to _Clause 9(b)_ or _Clause
9(c)_ in relation to the LDPE Technology Licence which gives the

obligations under _Clause 8_ (or, if the Vendor has failed to comply in all
material respects with such obligations, such failure not having been
remedied on or before Completion);

(or would be more than likely to have) a material adverse effect on the
Company, or a claim (or claims in aggregate) for a material amount under the
Environmental Covenant;

  

### (ix) no event or circumstance, other than an event or circumstance which
is constituted by matters which pertain either to general economic conditions
affecting the United Kingdom, European or world economy or to conditions in
the petrochemicals industry generally, having occurred or been discovered
which, if the Warranties were repeated immediately before Completion, would
have constituted a breach of Warranty and which would have (or would be more
than likely to have) a material adverse effect on the Company; and

  

### (x) no order or judgment of any court or governmental, statutory or
regulatory body having been issued or made prior to Completion, and no legal
or regulatory requirement remaining to be satisfied, which has the effect of
making unlawful or otherwise prohibiting either (i) the transfer of the

Agreement other than the transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser (in the case
of (ii) only) to a material extent.

  

## (b) The Vendor shall use all reasonable endeavours promptly to procure the
satisfaction of the conditions set out in _sub-clause (a)(i), (ii), (iv),

(a)(i), (ii), (iv), and (x)_

  

## (c) Without prejudice to _sub-clause (b)_ above, but subject to _sub-
clause (e) below_ , the Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable, take all
reasonable steps within its control (including making filings and
notifications and providing undertakings to merger control authorities where
such undertakings would not have a material adverse effect on the value of
the Acquired Business) to obtain all consents, approvals or actions of any
governmental or regulatory body or any other person which are required in

limitation:

  

### (i) providing information which is requested by any such governmental or

required by the Vendor for the purposes of obtaining any such consent,

### 

  

### (v) where requested by the Vendor, providing the Vendor (or advisers
nominated by the Vendor) with draft copies of all submissions and
communications to governmental or regulatory bodies or other persons at such
time as will allow the Vendor a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on
such submissions and communications before they are submitted or sent and
amending all such submissions or communications in accordance with the
reasonable requirements of the Vendor (or such nominated advisers) and
providing the Vendor (or such nominated advisers) with copies of all such
submissions and communications in the form submitted or sent.

  

## (d) Without prejudice to _sub-clause (b)_ above, the Vendor shall, so far
as is reasonably necessary, and as promptly as practicable, provide the
Purchaser with such reasonable assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably
require for the purpose of fulfilling the Purchasers obligations under _sub-
clause (c)_  above, including without limitation:

  

### (i) providing information which is requested by any governmental or
regulatory body or other persons whose consents, approvals or other actions
are required in order to permit completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including information which the Purchaser reasonably
considers necessary for it to make all notifications and filings to any such
body or person;

  

### (ii) co-operating with and assisting the Purchaser and the Company to
obtain any consents, approvals or actions of any governmental or regulatory
body or other person required by either the Purchaser or the Company;

  

### (iii) notifying the Purchaser, and providing copies, of any
communications from any such governmental or regulatory body or other persons
in relation to obtaining any such consent, approval or action where such
communications have not been independently or simultaneously supplied to the
Purchaser;

  

### (iv) where requested by the Purchaser, providing the Purchaser (or
advisers nominated by the Purchaser) with draft copies of all submissions and
communications to governmental or regulatory bodies or other persons at such
time as will allow the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to provide comments
on such submissions and communications before they are submitted or sent and
amending all such submissions or communications in accordance with the
reasonable requirements of the Purchaser (or such nominated advisers); and
providing the Purchaser (or such nominated advisers) with copies of all such
submissions and communications in the form submitted or sent.

  

## (e) Nothing in this _Clause 2_ shall impose any obligation on any party
to:

  

(i) enter into agreements to hold separate or dispose of any part of the
businesses of the Vendors Group or the Purchasers Group (as the case may
be); or

  

(ii) enter into agreements to supply any products; or

  

(iii) enter into agreements other than on commercially reasonable terms; or

     

   



  

(iv) enter into any consent judgment, consent agreement or undertaking in
relation to any part of its business which competes with all or part of the
Acquired Business; or

  

## (v) disclose confidential information relating to its financial or
business affairs to any person other than to another party to this Agreement
or such other partys legal advisors or to governmental or regulatory
authorities; or

  

## (vi) where that party is obliged under this _Clause 2_ to disclose
confidential information relating to its financial or business affairs to
another party to this Agreement or its legal advisers, disclose such
information beyond the extent necessary to enable such other party to comply
with its obligations under this _Clause 2_ (which may, by way of example,
involve disclosure of specific information to legal advisers on the basis
that it will not be disclosed to such other party).

  

## (f) The conditions set out in _sub-clauses (a)(i), (ii), (iv), (v), (viii)
and (x)_  may only be waived by the written agreement of each party to
this Agreement. The conditions set out in _sub-clauses (a)(iii), (vi), (vii)
and (ix)_ __ may be waived in writing by the Purchaser alone.  For the
avoidance of doubt, any such waiver by the Purchaser shall not in any respect
constitute a waiver by the Purchaser of any rights which it might have in
respect of the circumstances giving rise to the non-satisfaction of the
relevant condition, including but not limited to any right which it may have
to bring a claim for breach of warranty in the case of the non-satisfaction
of the conditions set out in _sub-clauses (a)(viii) or (ix)_ , provided that
if new information (as defined in _sub-clause (a)(iii)_ ) emerges in relation
to the LDPE Technology Licence and the Purchaser waives the condition set out
in _sub-clause (a)(iii)_ , that new information shall be deemed to have been
fairly disclosed in the Disclosure Letter and the Purchasers rights to bring
a claim for breach of Warranty in respect of the Warranties contained in
_paragraph 49_ or, insofar as it relates to the LDPE Technology Licence,
_paragraph 51(A),_ of _Schedule 3 shall be limited accordingly_.

  

## (g) If any fact which makes any of the conditions set out in _sub-clause
(a)_  incapable of being satisfied on or before the relevant Termination Date
comes to the knowledge of any party at any time prior to Completion then that
party shall notify the others of that fact and any party shall be entitled to
treat this Agreement as terminated by written notice to the others provided
that (i) no party shall be entitled to treat this Agreement as terminated
where that party is in breach of its obligations under this Clause where such
breach has contributed materially to the non-satisfaction of the condition
and (ii) no party other than the Purchaser or the Purchasers Guarantor
shall be entitled to treat this Agreement as terminated by reference to
the incapability of satisfaction of any of the conditions the satisfaction of
which may be waived by the Purchaser alone, unless and until the Purchaser
states in writing that it will not waive that condition.

  

## (h) If the conditions set out in _sub-clause (a)_ are not satisfied or
waived in accordance with _sub-clause (f)_ on or before the relevant
Termination Date, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.

  

## (i) If this Agreement is terminated or terminates pursuant to this Clause
then the obligations of each party under this Agreement (except for
obligations under this _Clause 2_ and _Clauses 26 to 28 and Clauses 30 to
40)_ shall automatically terminate provided that the rights and liabilities
of

     

   

## 

  

## the parties which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist and
provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, no rights and liabilities
in respect of the Warranties or in respect of any breach of _Clause 8_ shall
subsist following such termination. The only remedy available to any party
(i) for another partys failure to use all reasonable endeavours pursuant to
_sub-clause 2(b)_, or (ii) where the failure to satisfy a condition under
_Clause 2(a)_ has been caused by the Vendors breach of _Clause 8_ or a
breach of a Warranty, shall in either case be compensation for wasted costs
and expenses incurred in connection with negotiating this Agreement and
carrying out due diligence on the Company, and such remedy shall only be
available to the extent that such other party could reasonably have prevented
such failure or breach.

  

# **3.** ** SALE AND PURCHASE**

  

## (a) On the terms set out in this Agreement, the Vendor shall sell and the
Purchaser shall purchase the legal and beneficial ownership of the Shares as
at and with effect from Completion together with all rights attached or
accruing to them at Completion.

  

## (b) The Vendor undertakes that the Shares shall be transferred at
Completion free from all liens, charges and encumbrances and all other rights
in favour of or exercisable by third parties.

  

## (c) The Purchaser shall be entitled from Completion to exercise all rights
attached or accruing to the Shares, including, without limitation, the right
to receive all dividends or distributions or any return of capital declared,
paid or made by the Company, on or after the Completion Date.

  

## (d) The Vendor (for itself and on behalf of any other relevant member of
the Vendors Group) waives all rights of pre-emption over the Shares,
howsoever conferred and shall procure that no later than Completion all such
rights of pre-emption and any other similar or comparable rights over or in
respect of the Shares conferred upon any other person are waived so as to
permit the sale and purchase of the Shares hereunder.

  

## (e) For the avoidance of doubt, Part I of the Law of Property
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 shall not apply for the purpose of this
_Clause 3_.

  

# **4.** ** CONSIDERATION**

  

## (a) The initial aggregate consideration payable at Completion for the sale
of the Shares shall be the payment by the Purchaser to the Vendor of the Debt
Free Price:

  

#### (i) plus the Provisional Cash Amount;

  

### (ii) less the aggregate of the Provisional Third Party Debt Amount and
the Provisional Intra-Group Debt Amount;

  

### (iii) either:

  

### (A) plus the difference between the Provisional Working Capital and the
Target Working Capital, if the Provisional Working Capital is greater than
the Target Working Capital; or

     

   

### 

  

### (B) less the difference between the Provisional Working Capital and the
Target Working Capital, if the Provisional Working Capital is less than the
Target Working Capital;

  

### (iv) either:

  

### (A) less the amount (if any) by which the Provisional Actual Expenditure
is less than $208,000,000; or

  

### (B) plus the amount (if any) by which the Provisional Actual Expenditure
is more than $208,000,000; and

  

### (v) less the amount (if any) by which the Provisional Forecast
Expenditure is more than $360,000,000,

  

### provided the adjustments in (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) (but excluding the
adjustment in (iv)(B)) above shall only apply to the extent that they do not
result in an amount over the Debt Free Price being payable,

  

(the **" _Initial Cash Consideration_** ") (such payment to be made in
accordance with _Clause 10_).

  

Between the date of this Agreement and Completion, the parties will procure
that their respective accountants or financial personnel will meet with a
view to agreeing the methodology for determining the provisional amounts
specified in (i) to (v) above with a view to ensuring that those provisional
amounts are as accurate as possible. Where the parties do not agree prior
to Completion on a methodology for determining any such provisional amount,
the relevant provisional amount shall be as estimated in good faith by
the Vendor. Where the parties agree on a methodology in relation to any such
provisional amount prior to Completion, the Vendor shall use such methodology
in estimating such provisional amount.

  

Not less than 2 Business Days prior to the Completion Date the Vendor will
notify the Purchaser in writing of its estimates of the Provisional Cash
Amount, the Provisional Third Party Debt Amount, the Provisional Intra-Group
Debt Amount, the Provisional Working Capital, the Provisional Actual
Expenditure and the Provisional Forecast Expenditure together with supporting
documentation and a statement signed by the CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of
the Vendors Guarantor confirming that the estimates have been determined in
good faith and are believed by him (without assuming personal liability) to
be fair.

  

## (b) Following determination of the Final Third Party Debt Amount, the
Final Intra-Group Debt Amount, the Final Cash Amount, the Actual Expenditure,
the Forecast Expenditure and the Completion Working Capital, in accordance
with the provisions of _Clauses 5, 6 and 7_ and _Schedule 10_ , the Initial
Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to take account of payments made
pursuant to those Clauses in order to determine the final aggregate cash
consideration for the sale of the Shares (the **" _Final Cash Consideration_
"**), provided that:

  

### (i) the adjustments to the Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Clauses 5(a)(i) to (iv), 6 and 7_ and _Schedule 10_ (excluding any
adjustment under _paragraph 3(A)(i)_ of _Schedule 10_ and any interest under
_Clauses 5(a) or 6(b)_ ) shall apply only to the extent

     

   

### 

  

### that they do not cause the Final Cash Consideration (excluding
any reduction by virtue of _paragraph 14_ of _Schedule 4_ ) to exceed
the Debt Free Price; and

  

### (ii) any upward adjustment to the Initial Cash Consideration in relation
to Actual Expenditure pursuant to _paragraph 3(A)(i)_ of _Schedule 10_ or
in relation to Completion Working Capital pursuant to _Clause 5(a)(v) and
(vi)_  or in relation to interest under _Clauses 5(a) or 6(b)_ will
apply regardless of the extent it causes the Final Cash Consideration to
exceed the Debt Free Price.

  

## (c) The Initial Cash Consideration, the Final Cash Consideration, any
payments made pursuant to _Clauses 5, 6 and 7_ and _Schedule 10_, and
any other payment made under this Agreement to the Vendor shall be exclusive
of any amount in respect of VAT.

  

# **5.** ** CASH/THIRD PARTY DEBT/WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT**

  

## (a) Subject to _Clause 4(b)_ , if:

  

### (i) the Final Cash Amount is greater than the Provisional Cash Amount,
then the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the difference;

  

### (ii) the Final Cash Amount is less than the Provisional Cash Amount, then
the Vendor shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the difference;

  

### (iii) the Final Third Party Debt Amount is greater than the Provisional
Third Party Debt Amount, then the Vendor shall pay to the Purchaser an amount
equal to the difference;

  

### (iv) the Final Third Party Debt Amount is less than the Provisional Third
Party Debt Amount, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal
to the difference;

  

### (v) the Completion Working Capital is greater than the Target Working
Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the
difference,

  

## (A) less the amount paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor pursuant to
_Clause 4(a)(iii)(A)_ (if any); or

  

(B) plus the amount deducted from the Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Clause 4(a)(iii)(B)_ (if any);

  

### (vi) the Completion Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital, then the Vendor shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
difference,

  

(A) less the amount deducted from the Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Clause 4(a)(iii)(B)_ (if any); or

  

### (B) plus the amount paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor pursuant to
_Clause 4(a)(iii)(A)_ (if any),

     

   

### 

  

provided that the above payments shall be netted-off against each other and,
within five Business Days of the final agreement or determination of the
Final Cash Amount, the Final Third Party Debt Amount and the Completion
Working Capital, the Vendor shall be obliged to pay the Purchaser the net
balance or the Purchaser shall be obliged to pay the Vendor the net balance,
as the case may be, together with an amount equal to interest on the net
balance at the Agreed Rate (accrued daily) for the period from the Completion
Date to the date of payment.  Any payment under this _sub-clause 5(a)_ shall
constitute an adjustment to the Initial Cash Consideration.

  

## (b) Within 20 Business Days of Completion, the Vendor shall notify the
Purchaser of its calculation of the Final Cash Amount, the Final Third Party
Debt Amount and the Completion Working Capital together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation. The Purchaser shall notify the Vendor of
any dispute in relation to any such amount within 30 Business Days of the
date of the Vendors notice and shall provide reasonable details of the
grounds for disputing such amount and (so far as reasonably practicable) of
the amount which the Purchaser believes in good faith to be the correct
amount for such Final Cash Amount, Final Third Party Debt Amount or
Completion Working Capital. The Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed to
the Final Cash Amount, Final Third Party Debt Amount or Completion
Working Capital (as the case may be) which it does not so dispute within 30
Business Days of the date of the Vendors notice.

  

## (c) If the Purchaser serves notice of a dispute in accordance with _sub-
clause 5(b)_ , and if the Vendor and the Purchaser are unable to agree any of
the Final Cash Amount, Final Third Party Debt Amount or Completion Working
Capital within 15 Business Days of the date of the Purchasers notice
referred to in _sub-clause 5(b)_ (or such longer period as they may agree),
then the determination of such Final Cash Amount, Final Third Party Debt
Amount or Completion Working Capital shall be referred for determination to
the Expert who shall be instructed to notify both the Vendor and the
Purchaser of his determination and of the reasons for it within 20 Business
Days of such referral. In making his determination the Expert shall act as
expert and not arbitrator and his determination shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be final and binding and deemed to have been accepted
and approved by the Vendor and the Purchaser and shall be deemed to
constitute the Final Cash Amount, Final Third Party Debt Amount or Completion
Working Capital (as the case may be) for all purposes of this Agreement. The
fees and costs of the Expert incurred under this _Clause 5_ shall be paid as
to one-half by the Vendor and one-half by the Purchaser unless otherwise
directed by the Expert (who shall have the authority to make such direction
if he deems it equitable).

  

## (d) For the purposes of determining and agreeing the Final Cash Amount,
Final Third Party Debt Amount or Completion Working Capital the Purchaser
shall, and shall procure that the Company shall, give the Vendor and the
Expert reasonable access at all reasonable times to all books and records
relating to such Final Cash Amount, Final Third Party Debt Amount or
Completion Working Capital in their respective possession or control and the
Vendor shall as soon as reasonably practicable respond to all reasonable
enquiries and provide such relevant information reasonably within its control
as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and/or the Expert for that
purpose.

     

   

## 

  

## (e) In determining the Final Cash Amount, the Final Third Party Debt
Amount and Completion Working Capital the definitions, principles, policies,
procedures and methods and practices of accounting set out in _Attachment IV_
shall be applied.

  

## (f) All payments referred to in this _Clause 5_ shall be made in
immediately available funds to the Purchasers Bank Account or (as the case
may be) the Vendors Bank Account.

  

## (g) The Vendor undertakes that it will identify to the Purchaser no later
than the time of delivery of the Vendors notice referred to in _Clause 5(b)_
all items which are properly to be included in the Final Third Party Debt
Amount.

  

# **6.** ** INTRA-GROUP DEBTS**

  

## (a) The Purchaser shall immediately prior to Completion advance to the
Company on loan a sum sufficient to enable the Company to repay the amount
(if any) owed by it to the Vendors Group taken into account within the
Provisional Intra-Group Debt Amount, and the Vendor shall procure that,
immediately after receipt of that sum, but prior to Completion, (i) such sum
shall be paid by the Company to the Vendor (as trustee for the relevant
members of the Vendors Group) in repayment of such amount, and (ii) the
relevant member of the Vendors Group shall repay to the Company the amount
(if any) owed to the Company taken into account within the Provisional Intra-
Group Debt Amount provided that the price adjustments under _Clauses 4, 5 and
6_ shall be made disregarding such loan and the payments in (i) and (ii)
above, and the Vendor shall prepare its notifications under _sub-clauses
4(a) and 5(b)_ disregarding such loan and such payments (and for
the avoidance of doubt this _sub-clause 6(a)_ does not affect the
Vendors ability to prepare such notifications taking into account any cash
that will be applied to reduce the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount up until
immediately before such loan and such payments).

  

## (b) _Subject to Clause 4(b)_ , in relation to the Final Intra-Group Debt
Amount:

  

### (i) if the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount is greater than the Provisional
Intra-Group Debt Amount then the Vendor shall pay an amount equal to the
difference, together with an amount equivalent to interest which has accrued
on the amount of the difference outstanding from time to time at the Agreed
Rate for the period from the Completion Date to the date the relevant
difference is repaid, to the Purchaser within ten Business Days of the
agreement or determination of such Final Intra-Group Debt Amount;

  

### (ii) if the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount is less than the Provisional
Intra-Group Debt Amount then the Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the
difference, together with an amount equivalent to interest which has accrued
on the amount of the difference outstanding from time to time at the Agreed
Rate for the period from the Completion Date to the date the relevant
difference is repaid, to the Vendor within ten Business Days of the agreement
or determination of such Final Intra-Group Debt Amount.

  

## (c) Payments to be made under this _Clause 6_ from the Purchaser to the
Vendor or vice versa shall constitute an adjustment to the Initial Cash
Consideration.

     

   

## 

  

## (d) Within 20 Business Days of Completion, the Vendor shall notify the
Purchaser of the calculation of the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount owed by the
Company together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The
Purchaser shall notify the Vendor of any dispute in relation to any such
amount within 30 Business Days of the date of the Vendors notice and shall
provide reasonable details of the grounds for disputing such amount and (so
far as reasonably practicable) of the amount which the Purchaser believes in
good faith to be the correct amount for the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount.
 The Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed to the Final Intra-Group Debt
Amount if it does not so dispute within 30 Business Days of the date of the
Vendors notice.

  

## (e) If the Purchaser serves notice of a dispute in accordance with _sub-
clause 6(d)_ , and if the Vendor and the Purchaser are unable to agree the
Final Intra-Group Debt Amount within 15 Business Days of the date of the
Purchasers notice referred to in _sub-clause 6(d)_ (or such longer period as
they may agree), then the determination of the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount
may be referred for determination by any party to the Expert who shall be
instructed to notify both the Vendor and the Purchaser of his determination
and of the reasons for it within 20 Business Days of such referral. In making
his determination the Expert shall act as expert and not arbitrator and his
determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding
and deemed to have been accepted and approved by the Vendor and the Purchaser
and shall be deemed to constitute the relevant Final Intra-Group Debt Amount
for all purposes of this Agreement. The fees and costs of the Expert
incurred under this _Clause 6_ shall be paid as to one-half by the Vendor
and one-half by the Purchaser unless otherwise directed by the Expert
(who shall have the authority to make such direction if he deems it

### 

  

## (d) From the date hereof until the Completion Date, the Vendor will give,
and will cause the Company to give, the Purchaser and its representatives
such reasonable information in respect of the Company as the Purchaser may
reasonably request and notice of any matter coming to the knowledge of Sam
Scruggs, Jim Moore, Michael Maughan, Mahomed Maiter, John ONeill, Paul
Booth, Michael Ducker or Ronald Grant after the date of this Agreement which
the relevant individual is aware or ought reasonably to have been aware
constitutes a breach of this _Clause 8_ or any of the Warranties. The Vendor
undertakes that immediately prior to Completion the individuals listed in
_Schedule 1_ in the definition of "so far as the Vendor is aware" will be
consulted by one or more of the individuals named in the preceding sentence
of this paragraph in order to determine whether a notification is required
under this sub-clause in relation to a breach of this _Clause 8_  or any of
the Warranties.

  

## (e) Subject to _sub-clause (b)_, between the date of this Agreement
and Completion, the Vendor will comply with, and procure that the Company
complies with, the conduct of business provisions contained in _paragraph 1_
of _Schedule 10_ ("Wilton LDPE Project").

  

## (f) Between the date of this Agreement and Completion the Vendor shall
procure that the Company shall not depart in any material respect from
existing commitments to capital expenditure, excluding any such commitments
to the extent they relate to "Project X", being the proposal to convert the
Arosolvar unit to naphtha processing in order to increase feed-product
differentials.

  

## (g) The Vendor shall procure that the Company shall by no later than
immediately before Completion repay any amount owed to the Vendors Group
properly to be regarded as within the Intra-Group Balances to the Vendor (as
trustee for the relevant members of the Vendors Group) and the Vendor shall
procure that the relevant member of the Vendors Group shall repay any amount
owed to the Company properly to be regarded as within the Intra-Group
Balances to the Company. Such repayment shall be made in
immediately available funds and in the currency in which the relevant amount
was expressed to be repayable regardless of whether relevant amounts are then
due or payable such that following the repayments contemplated by this sub-
clause, Intra-Group Balances as at Completion will be zero.  Subject to the
following sentence, if following Completion, it is discovered that any Intra
Group Balance remains after such repayment, whether owing by the Company or
by a member of the Vendors Group, such remaining Intra-Group Balance shall
be written off by the Company and the relevant member of the Vendors Group.
Where any such remaining Intra-Group Balances are owed to the Company and,
had all such Intra-Group Balances been settled immediately prior to
Completion, that settlement would have resulted in an increase in the Initial
Cash Consideration pursuant to an adjustment under _Clause 4(a)(i) or (ii)_ ,
but for the fact that such increase was prevented or limited under _Clause
4(a)_ by virtue of it otherwise resulting in an amount over the Debt Free
Price being payable, then to the extent only that such increase would have
been so prevented or limited, the Company shall not be obliged to write off
such remaining Intra-Group Balances.

  

## (h) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Completion Date
the Vendor shall be permitted to procure that the Company completes the
Lease.

  

## (i) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Completion Date
the Vendor shall be permitted to procure that the Company carries out or
procures the carrying out of the Outstanding Refurbishment Works. Following
the Completion Date, the Purchaser shall procure that the Company carries out
or procures the carrying out of the Outstanding Refurbishment Works.

  

## (j) The Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor on the Completion Date the sum
of £0.35 million exclusive of VAT (if applicable) towards the Outstanding
Refurbishment Cost. The Outstanding Refurbishment Cost itself shall be met by
the Vendor as and when such costs fall due.

  

## (k) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Completion Date
and to the extent not already implemented by the Company, the Vendor will be
permitted at its own expense to continue to negotiate on behalf of the
Company a 10% reduction in the surplus floor space demised by the Lease in
accordance with clause 6.7 of the Lease and/or at its own expense to
otherwise negotiate a reduction in surplus floor space demised by the Lease
on terms which do not involve the Company incurring any cost or expense not
fully for the account of the Vendor.

  

# **9.** ** LDPE TECHNOLOGY LICENCE**

  

## (a) From the date hereof until the Completion Date, the Vendor will not,
and will procure that the Company will not, agree to any amendment to the
terms of the LDPE Technology Licence.

     

   

## 

  

## (b) If, between the date hereof until the Completion Date, any new
information (and "new information" shall for the purposes of this Clause have
the meaning ascribed to it in _Clause 2(a)(iii)_) comes to the attention of
either the Vendor or the Purchaser which relates to the period prior to the
date hereof and which is relevant to the interpretation of the LDPE
Technology Licence, the Vendor or the Purchaser (as the case may be) shall
promptly inform the other and thereafter the Vendor and the Purchaser shall
as soon as reasonably practicable and on a shared cost basis jointly instruct
Lord Grabiner Q.C. by:

  

### (i) providing him with the new information that has emerged; and

  

### (ii) seeking an opinion confirming that such new information would not
change the conclusion in paragraph 16 of his opinion, given on 6 September
2006, that the terms of the LDPE Technology Licence do not permit ExxonMobil
either to terminate such licence or to accelerate the payment of royalties
under such licence in each case as a result of the proposed sale of the
Company to the Purchaser and that such claims, if put forward by ExxonMobil
before a court or arbitrator correctly applying English law, would fail.

  

## (c) In the event that Lord Grabiner Q.C. is not available, by reason of
death, incapacity or otherwise, to provide this second opinion, the Vendor
and the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable and on a shared
cost basis jointly instruct Laurence Rabinowitz Q.C., or in the event of
his unavailability, Mark Barnes Q.C., by:

  

### (i) providing him with the instructions previously given to Lord Grabiner
Q.C. and a copy of his opinion, together with the new information and a copy
of the LDPE Technology Licence; and

  

### (ii) seeking an opinion confirming that, taking into account such new
information, he would conclude that the terms of the LDPE Technology Licence
do not permit ExxonMobil either to terminate such licence or to accelerate
the payment of royalties under such licence in each case as a result of the
proposed sale of the Company to the Purchaser and that such claims, if put
forward by ExxonMobil before a court or arbitrator correctly applying English
law, would fail.

  

## (d) Prior to Completion, the Purchaser may engage in discussions with
ExxonMobil in relation to the LDPE Technology Licence, provided that such
discussions are limited to appropriate ring-fencing protections to both the
Purchaser and ExxonMobil relative to each partys LDPE technology and know-
how. If, in the context of such discussions, ExxonMobil indicates that the
sale of the Company might have an adverse effect on the ongoing validity of
the LDPE Technology Licence or otherwise provides new information, the
Purchaser will reasonably promptly notify the Vendor of such fact, and the
Vendor will approach ExxonMobil to discuss the matter and will keep the
Purchaser informed as to the progress of its discussions.

  

## (e) Prior to Completion, the Purchaser will not seek contractual
modifications to the LDPE Technology Licence with ExxonMobil.  For the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchasers satisfaction as to its ability to
successfully negotiate contractual modifications with ExxonMobil will not be
a condition to Completion.

# **10.** ** COMPLETION**

  

## (a) Completion of the sale and purchase of the Shares shall take place at
10 a.m. on the last Business Day of the month in which all of the conditions
in _Clause 2(a)_  shall have been satisfied (or, where applicable, waived in

Purchaser at Completion in accordance with _Schedule 2_.

  

## (e) Receipt of funds in accordance with _sub-clause (d)_ shall constitute

Cash Consideration but not, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of the
Purchasers other obligations under this _Clause 10_ or _Clauses 5, 6 and 7
and Schedule 10_.

  

## (f) If either the Vendor or the Purchaser fails to comply in any material
respect with its obligations under _Schedule 2_ at Completion then the other
may:

  

### (i) defer Completion (so that the provisions of this _Clause 10_ shall
apply to Completion as so deferred);

  

### (ii) proceed to Completion as far as practicable (without limiting its
rights under this Agreement); or

  

### (iii) terminate this Agreement by notice to the other.

  

## (g) The right to terminate under this _Clause 10_ is without prejudice to
_Clause 26_ and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies provided by
law, including any right to seek compensation for the other partys breach
leading to such termination. Notwithstanding such termination, obligations
under _Clauses 26 and 28_ and _Clauses 30 to 40_ and the rights and
liabilities of the parties which have accrued prior to termination shall
subsist and provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, no rights and
liabilities in respect of the Warranties or in respect of any breach of
_Clause 8_ shall subsist following such termination.

  

# **11.** ** ACTION AFTER COMPLETION**

  

## (a) The Vendor shall procure that originals of all notices,

of the Vendors Group.

## (a) Subject as provided in _sub-clause (b)_, the Purchaser, for itself
and its successors and assigns, covenants that, at any time and from time to

## of an appropriate member of the Vendors Group as the primary obligor in
respect of, each such Assurance on a non-recourse basis to the Company and

the matter giving rise to the payment, pay to the other party an amount which
will leave it, or other such member, (after payment of that amount) in the

in which case the party concerned shall take all such steps as may be
reasonable and practicable in the circumstances to agree the contents of such
announcement with the other parties before making such announcement.

  

## (c) The restrictions contained in this Clause shall continue to apply
after the termination of this Agreement without limit in time.

provided that any such information disclosed pursuant to _paragraph (i) or

(b) The Purchasers Guarantor irrevocably appoints the Purchaser to be its

England and Wales by service on its agent effected in any manner permitted by

(as the case may be) shall appoint a replacement agent having an address for
service in England or Wales and shall notify the other parties to this
Agreement of the name and address of the replacement agent.  Failing such

entitled by notice to the Vendors Guarantor or the Purchasers Guarantor (as
the case may be)  to appoint a replacement agent to act on behalf of the
Vendors Guarantor or the Purchasers Guarantor (as the case may be). The

service on a replacement agent.

  

(d) A copy of any Service Document served on an agent shall be sent by post

# **40.** ** RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES**

  

The provisions of _Clause 20(a)_ , _Clause 14(c)_ ,  _Clause 17(h)_ and
_Schedule 6_ confer a benefit on the persons specifically referred to in
those provisions (each, a " ** _Third Party_** ") and, subject to the
remaining terms of this Clause, are intended to be enforceable by each such
Third Party by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
The parties do not intend that any term of this Agreement, apart from
the provisions specifically referred to in this Clause, should be
enforceable, by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by
any person who is not a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Clause, this Agreement may be amended or varied in any way
and at any time by the parties to the Agreement without the consent of
any Third Party.

  

# **41.** ** PRE-SALE SPLIT OUT**

  

The Vendor and the Purchaser will negotiate prior to Completion with a view
to agreeing on an alternative structure for the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, such alternative structure to involve (i) the Company
transferring to a new company (" **Newco"** ) to be set up as a new member
of the Vendors Group such elements of the Acquired Business as the Purchaser
may reasonably request and/or (ii) a tolling or similar
contractual arrangement/structure (the " **Pre-Sale Split"** ) and on the
Completion Date the Vendor selling the Shares and (if applicable) the entire
issued share capital of Newco, provided that (without prejudice to the
generality of the requirement of reasonableness):

  



  

(a) the Purchaser will indemnify the Vendor, any other member of the Vendors
Group and (if so requested) the Company against all liabilities and
reasonable costs incurred by, or claims brought against, them in connection
with or resulting from the Pre-Sale Split;

  

(b) without limiting paragraph (a) above, the Purchaser will indemnify the
Vendor, any other member of the Vendors Group and (if so requested) the
Company against any amount by which the liability to Tax incurred by the
Vendor, any other member of the Vendors Group or the Company as a direct or
indirect consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, the Pre-Sale Split,
the disposal of the Shares or the disposal of the shares in Newco (or any
alternative structure agreed pursuant to this _Clause 41_ ) exceeds the
liability to Tax that would have been incurred by them as a direct or
indirect consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, the sale of the
Shares as currently contemplated in _Clause 3_ of this Agreement, and neither
the Tax Warranties nor clause 2 (Covenant) of the Tax Covenant will apply to
any liability to Tax incurred by the Company, or any other event,
act, transaction or omission occurring, in connection with the Pre-Sale
Split;

  

(c) the Vendor will have no obligation to do or to procure anything in
connection with the Pre-Sale Split which would cause it, any other member of
the Vendors Group or the Company unreasonable inconvenience, cost or risk;

  

(d) neither the Vendor nor the Company shall be obliged to seek the consent
of any third party (not being a member or the Vendors Group, an Employee or
a trustee of the Huntsman pension scheme) for the doing of anything in
connection with the Pre-Sale Split;

  

(e) the amount of time required to be spent by the personnel of the Vendor,
any other member of the Vendors Group or the Company in connection with the
Pre-Sale Split will be modest and not such as to interfere materially with
their existing duties;

  

(f) the Purchaser acknowledges that nothing done by way of a Pre-Sale Split
shall be deemed to fall within the circumstances provided for in _paragraph
17.1 (Part E) of Schedule 9_ ;

  

(g) the Vendor will be not be obliged to use more than reasonable endeavours
to obtain the consent of the trustees of the Huntsman pension scheme in
relation to the Pre-Sale Split and no party will be required to agree to Pre-
Sale Split if such consent would be on terms which are less favourable to
that party than the terms which have already been agreed with the trustees of
the Huntsman

       

pension scheme and the Pre-Sale Split will be subject to the consent of the
trustees of the Huntsman pension scheme;

  



  

(h) no party will be required to agree to a Pre-Sale Split if it would give
rise to a less favourable tax treatment (or create greater uncertainty about
the tax treatment) for that party in connection with the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement than if the Pre-Sale Split did not occur;

  

(i) no party will be required to agree to a Pre-Sale Split if it will lead
to Completion taking place at a later date than it would otherwise have
taken place (including where it will lead to the non-satisfaction or a delay
in the satisfaction of any of the conditions set out in _Clause 2_ ) and
the agreement and achievement of a Pre-Sale Split will not, for the avoidance
of doubt, be a condition to Completion;

  

(j) the Pre-Sale Split will not result in less consideration being payable by
the Purchaser than would otherwise have been the case under this Agreement or
in an increase in the liability of the Vendor or any member of the Vendors
Group under any of the Warranties, indemnities or other provisions of this
Agreement; and

  

(k) the Purchaser must provide to the Vendor within 14 days of this
Agreement reasonable details of the structure it proposes for the Pre-Sale
Split (failing which, there will be no negotiation in relation to the Pre-
Sale Split) and the Vendor will be entitled to raise any reasonable
objections to such proposal and if, when the parties pursue negotiations
relating to the Purchasers proposal, it becomes apparent that the proposal
would involve the Vendor, the Company or any member of the Vendors Group
doing anything which it would not be obliged to do or which is otherwise
prevented under _paragraphs (c) to (i)_ above, the Vendor will not be
entitled to pursue those negotiations further,

  

and the provisions of _paragraphs (a) to (k)_ above will apply whether
Completion occurs or not, and notwithstanding termination of this Agreement
for any reason. If the Pre-Sale Split is agreed, appropriate amendments to
the terms of this Agreement and the Tax Covenant shall be made to reflect the
provisions of _paragraphs (a) to (j)_ above and the alternative transaction
structure. This will include changing references in this Agreement to Shares
so that they comprise both shares in the Company and shares in
Newco, changing references in this Agreement to the Company to be references
to the Company and Newco, changing _Clause 8_ of this Agreement to permit
the restructuring to take place and changing _Clause 2_ of this Agreement
so that any consequences of implementing the Pre-Sale Split will not be
treated as a material adverse effect for the purposes of _Clause 2(a)(viii)
or (ix)_.

the Vendor under each of the Environmental Covenant and the Tax Covenant in
so far as any provision in this Schedule is expressed to be applicable
thereto.

  

(F) The provisions of this Schedule shall not apply to any claim for breach
of any of the Warranties in _paragraphs 1, 2 or 3_ of _Schedule 3_.

  

(G) The provisions of this Schedule shall not apply to any claim for breach
of any of the Warranties in circumstances where the Vendor knowingly failed
to disclose facts or circumstances of which any of Sam Scruggs, Jim Moore,
Michael Maughan, Mahomed Maiter, John ONeill, Paul Booth, Michael Ducker,
Ronald Grant, Mike Kern, Wade Rogers, Ian Machin, Brian Thomas, Gary Hodgson,
John Galbraith, David Hughes, Joe Duffy, Kevin Hardman, Brian Watson, David

actual knowledge at the date hereof that such facts or circumstances
constituted a breach of the Warranties. The Vendor confirms that each of
such individuals has read the Warranties.

     

   

 **2.** ** _Time limits for bringing claims_**

  

No claim shall be brought against the Vendor in respect of any of the
Warranties or the Tax Covenant unless the Purchaser shall have given to the
Vendor written notice of its intention to make such claim:

  

### (i) subject to _sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii)_, on or before the
second anniversary of the Completion Date; or

  

### (ii) in respect of any claims under the Tax Warranties or the Tax
Covenant on or before the seventh anniversary of the Completion Date; or

  

(iii) in respect of any claim for breach of the Warranties in _paragraph 21
of Schedule 3_ on or before the sixth anniversary of the Completion Date,

  

provided that the liability of the Vendor in respect of such claim shall
absolutely terminate (if such claim has not been previously satisfied,
settled or withdrawn) if legal proceedings in respect of such claim shall not
have been commenced within twelve months of the service of such notice and
for this purpose proceedings shall not be deemed to have been commenced
unless they shall have been properly issued and (except where the Vendor is
resisting service) validly served upon the Vendor.

  

Such notice shall specify (in reasonable detail) the matter which gives rise
to the claim, the nature of the claim and (to the extent reasonably
practicable) the amount claimed in respect thereof (detailing the Purchasers
calculation of the loss thereby alleged to have been suffered by it or the
relevant member of the Purchasers Group), but the Vendor shall not be
entitled to dispute liability by reason only of any alleged deficiency in the
content of such notice.

  

 **3.** ** _Conduct of third party claims_**

  

## (A) Upon the Purchaser becoming aware of any assessment, claim, action or
demand against any member of the Purchasers Group (for the purposes of this
_paragraph 3_, a " **third party claim** ") which in its reasonable opinion
is likely to give rise to any claim by the Purchaser it in respect of any of
the Warranties, the Purchaser shall:

  

(i) as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Vendor thereof in writing;

  

(ii) subject to the Vendor indemnifying the Purchaser against any liability,
cost, damage or expense which may be incurred thereby (but without implying
any admission of liability thereby), take such action and give such
information and access to personnel, premises, chattels, documents and
records to the Vendor and their professional advisers as the Vendor may
reasonably request and the Vendor shall be entitled to require the Company to
take such action and give such information and assistance in order to avoid,
dispute, resist, mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or appeal any claim in
respect thereof or adjudication with respect thereto;

  

(iii) subject to the Vendor indemnifying the Purchaser against any liability,
cost, damage or expense which may be incurred thereby (but without implying
any admission of liability

     

   

thereby), at the request of the Vendor, allow the Vendor to take the sole
conduct of such actions as the Vendor may deem appropriate in connection with
any such assessment or claim in the name of the Purchaser or the Company and
in that connection the Purchaser shall give or cause to be given to
the Vendor all such assistance as the Vendor may reasonably require in
avoiding, disputing, resisting, settling, compromising, defending or
appealing any such claim and shall instruct such legal or other professional
advisors as the Vendor may nominate to act on behalf of the Purchaser or any
relevant company, as appropriate, but to act in accordance with the Vendors
instructions provided that the Purchaser shall not be required to commence
any legal proceedings where either:

  

(a) the Purchaser has validly assigned all of its rights in relation to the
relevant claim to the Vendor in a manner which entitles the Vendor to the
same benefits in respect of such rights as the Purchaser had; or

  

(b) where the above _sub-paragraph (a)_ does not apply, the Vendor has not
notified the relevant party against whom such proceedings are brought that
such proceedings are being brought at the instruction of the Vendor;

  

(iv) be entitled to participate in the defence of any claim and to employ
separate counsel to represent it at its own expense, provided that the Vendor
shall control the defence of any claim;

  

(v) make no admission of liability, agreement, settlement or compromise with
any third party in relation to any such claim or adjudication without the
prior written consent of the Vendor; and

  

(vi) take all reasonable action to mitigate any loss suffered by it or any
member of the Purchasers Group in respect of which a claim could be made
under the Warranties.

  

## (B) Notwithstanding  _paragraph 3(A)_ above, (i) the Vendor shall be
entitled on behalf of the Purchaser to settle any third party claim provided
that, and (ii) neither the Purchaser or the Company shall be obliged to admit
liability or settle any third party claim unless, the Vendor has first
admitted liability to the Purchaser for breach of the applicable Warranty.

  

## (C) Without prejudice to any remedy the Vendor may have (including any
claim for damages for breach of _paragraph 3(A) above)_ , or the extent of
any damages to which the Vendor might be entitled, in relation to such
failure and without prejudice to the Purchasers duty to mitigate or any
reduction in the quantum of damages the Purchaser may be able to recover if
it fails to mitigate, the failure by the Purchaser to comply with _paragraph
3(A)_ above shall not by itself disqualify it from maintaining a claim under
any applicable Warranty.

  

 **4.** ** _No liability if loss is otherwise compensated for_**

  

(A) No liability shall attach to the Vendor by reason of any breach of any of
the Warranties or the Tax Covenant to the extent that the same loss has
been recovered by the Purchaser under the Tax Covenant or any other Warranty
or term of this Agreement or any other document referred to herein and
accordingly the Purchaser may only recover once in respect of the same loss.

     

   



  

(B) The Vendor shall not be liable (save that nothing in this sub-paragraph
shall prejudice the right of any Further Protected Person under the terms of
the Environmental Covenant) for breach of any of the Warranties or under the
Tax Covenant or the Environmental Covenant to the extent that the subject of
the claim has been or is made good or is otherwise compensated for without
cost to the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group.

  

(C)  The Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours to obtain and utilise,
or as the case may be procure the obtaining and utilisation of, any Tax
credit, repayment or other Tax benefit which is available to the Purchaser or
any other member of the Purchasers Group solely as a result of the matter
giving rise to a liability of the Vendor for any breach of the Warranties or
the under the Environmental Covenant and if the Purchaser or any other member
of the Purchasers Group obtains and utilises any such Tax credit, repayment
or other Tax benefit, the Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable after the
utilisation in whole or in part of any such Tax credit, repayment or other
Tax benefit, pay to the Vendor an amount which will leave it (after that
payment) in the same after Tax position as it would have been had the
obligation of the Vendor to make the payment not arisen. For the purposes of
this _paragraph_ , the amount of any Tax credit, repayment or other Tax
benefit is to be determined by the auditors of the Purchaser at the shared
expense of both parties and is to be certified as such to the Vendor.

  

 **5.** ** _Recovery from Insurers and other Third Parties_**

  

(A) If, in respect of any matter which would give rise to a claim under the
Warranties or under the Environmental Covenant, any member of the Purchasers
Group is entitled to claim under any policy of insurance, then no such matter
shall be the subject of a claim under the Warranties or under the
Environmental Covenant, unless and until the appropriate member of the
Purchasers Group shall have made a claim against its insurers and used all
reasonable endeavours to pursue such claim and any such insurance claim shall
then reduce by the amount recovered or extinguish any such claims under the
Warranties or under the Environmental Covenant.

  

(B) Where the Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group is at any time
entitled to recover from some other person any sum in respect of any matter
giving rise to a claim under the Warranties or under the Environmental
Covenant (provided that this does not apply to a claim under the ICI
Indemnity), the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the member of the
Purchasers Group concerned shall, subject to the Vendor indemnifying the
Purchaser against any liability, cost, damage or expense which may be
incurred thereby, take all reasonable steps to enforce such recovery prior to
taking action against the Vendor (other than to notify the Vendor of the
claim against the Vendor) and, in the event that the Purchaser or any member
of the Purchasers Group shall recover any amount from such other person, the
amount of the claim against the Vendor shall be reduced by the amount
recovered provided that the Purchaser shall not be required to commence any
legal proceedings where either:

  

(i) the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Purchasers Group has validly
assigned all of its rights in relation to the relevant claim to the Vendor in
a manner which entitles the Vendor to the same benefits in respect of such
rights as the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Purchasers Group had;
or

     

   



  

(ii) where  _sub-paragraph (B)(i)_ does not apply, the Vendor has not
notified the relevant party against whom such proceedings are brought that
such proceedings are being brought at the instruction of the Vendor.

  

(C) If the Vendor pays at any time to the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchasers Group an amount pursuant to a claim in respect of the Warranties
or under the Environmental Covenant or under any other provision of this
Agreement and the Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchasers Group
subsequently recovers from some other person any sum in respect of any matter
giving rise to such claim, the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the
relevant member of the Purchasers Group shall, repay to the Vendor the
lesser of (i) the amount paid by the Vendor to the Purchaser or other member
of the Purchasers Group and (ii) the sum (including interest (if any))
recovered from such other person (less, in each case, the costs of recovery
of such sum).

  

(D) For the purposes of _paragraph 2_ of this Schedule, provided notice of
the potential claim is given by the Purchaser to the Vendor within the
period specified in that paragraph, there shall be no obligation on the part
of the Purchaser to commence proceedings until after the outcome of its claim
under its insurance policy or against the third party has been finally dealt
with, and the Purchasers right to maintain its claim against the Purchaser
shall not expire by reason of its failure to commence such proceedings.
Further, notwithstanding this _paragraph 5_, the Purchaser may
commence Proceedings against the Vendor at any time if by failing to do so it
would lose (or risk losing) the right to do so by reason of the operation of
any statute of limitation or other time limit.

  

 **6.** ** _Acts of Purchaser_**

  

(A) No claim shall lie against the Vendor under or in relation to the
Warranties to the extent that such claim is attributable to:

  

(i) any act, omission, transaction, or arrangement carried out by the
Purchaser or by a member of the Purchasers Group on or after Completion
which the Purchaser or the member of the Purchasers Group could reasonably
have avoided and which it knew or ought reasonably to have appreciated might
give rise to the claim; or

  

(ii) any omission by the Vendor or the Company between the date of this
Agreement and Completion that is due to the Purchaser unreasonably
withholding its consent to a matter in respect of which consent is sought
under _Clause 8_.

  

(B) The Vendor shall not be liable for any breach of any Warranty, which
would not have arisen but for any reorganisation or change in ownership of
any member of the Purchasers Group or of any assets of any such member after
Completion or change in any accounting basis on which any member of the
Purchasers Group values its assets or any accounting basis, method, policy
or practice of any member of the Purchasers Group which is different from
that adopted or used in the preparation of the Accounts (provided the
Accounts comply with the Warranties in _paragraph 9_ of _Schedule 3)_.

     

   



  

 **7.** ** _The Accounts_**

  

No matter shall be the subject of a claim under the Warranties or under the
Environmental Covenant, to the extent that allowance, provision or reserve in
respect of such matter shall have been expressly made in the Accounts (other
than any such allowance, provision or reserve in respect of Tax).

  

 **8.** ** _Retrospective legislation_**

  

No liability shall arise in respect of any breach of any of the Warranties to
the extent that liability for such breach occurs or is increased directly or
indirectly as a result of any legislation not in force on or prior to the
date of this Agreement or as a result of the withdrawal of any published
extra-statutory concession or other agreement or arrangement currently
granted by or made with any governmental authority or as a result of any
change after the date of this Agreement of any generally
accepted interpretation or application of any legislation or in the
enforcement policy or practice of the relevant authorities.

  

 **9.** ** _Purchaser s knowledge_**

  

The rights of the Purchaser to maintain a claim for breach of the Warranties
shall not be limited by, nor shall the quantum of damages to which it is
entitled thereunder be reduced by any matter of which the Purchaser is, or is
alleged to have been, aware (whether actually, or notionally, or vicariously)
or which it could have discovered, at or prior to Completion:

  

(i) except to the extent provided by _paragraph 12_ of this _Schedule 4_ ;
and

giving rise to such a claim and Abdullah Bazid intends, having consulted with
such individuals as to whether they are aware of such circumstances or facts
(and the Purchaser confirms that he has so consulted such individuals), that
the Purchaser will bring such a claim, unless the Purchaser has notified the
Vendor in writing of such circumstances and facts and such intention prior to
the date hereof.

negotiated and agreed the terms of the Warranties and agreed the terms of the
Disclosure Letter on the basis set out in this paragraph.

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees with the Vendor (on behalf of itself and

## (i) the discussions with them regarding the purchase of the Shares and the

the Vendors Group or any of their respective agents, directors,
officers, employees and advisers has made or makes any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information, or accepts
any duty of care in relation to the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchasers Group or any provider of finance to any such person in respect of
the provision of any such information and that none of such persons shall be

 **(A)** **_Vendor s obligations conditional upon Purchasers obligations
being duly performed_**

  

The Vendors obligations in this **paragraph 6** are conditional upon the
Purchasers obligations in **paragraphs 3** and **4** being duly performed
before the Payment Date.

     

   



  

 **(B)** ** ****_Vendor to procure payment of Transfer Amount on the Payment
Date by the Vendor s Scheme Trustees_**

  

(i) Subject to **paragraph 6(A)**, the Vendor shall use its reasonable
endeavours to procure that on the Payment Date, or such other date as the
Vendor and the Purchaser may agree, the Vendors Scheme (to the extent that
it can lawfully make such payment) shall pay the Transfer Amount to the
Purchasers Scheme.

  

(ii) The payment of the Transfer Amount shall be satisfied by the transfer
of a reasonable cross-section of the assets of the Vendors Scheme (as agreed
by the Vendors Scheme and the Purchasers Scheme) having a mid-market value
on the day before the Payment Date equal to the Transfer Amount.

  

(iii) If the Vendors Scheme and the Purchasers Scheme are unable to
agree some or all of the particular assets to be transferred or the mid-
market value of any such assets, the payment of the Transfer Amount (or the
appropriate part of it) shall be satisfied by the Vendors Scheme
transferring cash equal in value to that part of the Transfer Amount in
respect of which there has been no agreement as to the assets to be
transferred less a deduction to reflect dealing costs and advisers fees.

  

 **(C)** ** ****_Shortfall_**

  

(i) Subject to **paragraph 6(A)**, if the amount which has been actually
transferred (if any) by the Vendors Scheme to the Purchasers Scheme on or
before the Payment Date in respect of the Transferring Members is less (other
than by the application of the final sentence of **paragraph 6(B)**) than
the Transfer Amount plus the Deficit Transfer Amount, then the Vendor shall
pay to the Purchaser within 5 Business Days after the Payment Date, so far as
possible by way of repayment of the consideration payable for the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement, a cash sum in US dollars or, if the Vendor
and the Purchaser agree, in pounds sterling (the **"Gross Shortfall"**
) calculated according to the formula:

  

![](g203241kc11i001.gif)((A-B) + C)

  

where

       

A

    |  

=

    |  

the Transfer Amount plus the Deficit Transfer Amount  in pounds sterling;

    
---|---|--- 
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

B

    |  

=

    |  

the amount in pounds sterling actually transferred  on or before the Payment
Date multiplied by the Timing Adjustment for the  period from and including
the date or dates on which such amount was  transferred to and excluding the
Payment Date;

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

C

    |  

=

    |  

the amount representing interest at the Agreed  Interest Rate on an amount
equal to A - B for the period from and including  the Payment Date to and
excluding the date on which payment is made under  this sub-paragraph,

    
   



     

   



  

provided that, if ((A  B) + C) exceeds £18 million then ((A  B) + C) shall
be deemed to be equal to £18 million and where, unless the Vendor and the
Purchaser agree otherwise, once ((A  B) + C) has been calculated in pounds
sterling it is converted to US dollars in accordance with **paragraph
6(C)(v)**.

  

The amount of the Gross Shortfall shall be determined by the Vendors Actuary
and agreed by the Purchasers Actuary or, in default of agreement, be
determined under **paragraph 9**.

  

(ii) (a) If any deduction or withholding is required by law to be made from
the payment of the Gross Shortfall, the Vendor shall also be obliged to pay
to the Purchaser such sum as will, after such deduction or withholding has
been made, leave the Purchaser with the same amount as it would have been
entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make such
deduction or withholding.

  

(b) If any Tax Authority brings into charge to Tax (or into any
computation of income, profit or gain for the purposes of any charge to Tax)
the payment of the Gross Shortfall, then the Vendor shall pay such additional
amount to the Purchaser as shall be required to ensure that the Purchaser is
placed in the same after Tax position as if the obligation to make payment of
the Gross Shortfall had not arisen.

  

PROVIDED that the Purchaser shall:-

  

(aa) use all reasonable endeavours to obtain and utilise, or as the case
may be procure the obtaining and utilisation of, any Tax credit, repayment or
other Tax benefit which is available to the Purchaser or any other member of
the Purchasers Group solely as a result of the payment of the Gross
Shortfall on the same basis as any other Tax credit, repayment or other Tax
benefit which is available to the Purchaser or any other such member; and

  

(bb) as soon as practicable after the utilisation in whole or in part of
any Tax credit, repayment or other Tax benefit which is available to the
Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group solely as a result of
the payment of the Gross Shortfall, pay to the Vendor by way of further
consideration for the Shares an amount in US dollars (such amount to be
calculated in accordance with **paragraph 6(C)(v)** ) or, if the Vendor and
the Purchaser agree, in pounds sterling equal to the amount of Tax which has
been saved by the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group
in consequence of utilising in whole or in part such Tax credit, repayment
or other Tax benefit.

  

(iii) If, after the Payment Date, the Vendors Scheme makes any payment
in respect of any benefits retained by the Vendors Scheme in respect of
any Transferring Member the Purchaser shall pay forthwith to the Vendor so
far as possible by way of further consideration for the Shares a cash sum in
US dollars equal to that payment converted to US dollars in accordance with
**paragraph 6(C)(v)** or, if the Vendor and the Purchaser agree, in pounds
sterling,

     

   



  

provided that the Vendor shall be required to use its reasonable endeavours
to prevent any payment being made by the Vendors Scheme where such payment
is not legally required. If the Purchaser does not pay the amount due under
the previous sentence within 2 days of the date of the payment in respect of
benefits by the Vendors Scheme, the Purchaser shall, in addition,
pay interest at the Agreed Interest Rate (as well after as before judgment)
on the amount due from and including the date on which the payment was made
by the Vendors Scheme to and excluding the date on which payment actually is
made by the Purchaser.

  

(iv) Whenever, after the payment by the Purchaser of any amount due under
**paragraph 6(C)(iii)** , the Vendor achieves a reduction in its liability to
corporation tax as a result of being able to treat a payment of an amount
equal to that amount to the Vendors Scheme as deductible for corporation tax
purposes, the Vendor shall pay to the Purchaser, within 7 days after the
Vendor would otherwise have been liable to pay the saved corporation tax, so
far as possible by way of repayment of the consideration payable for the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement a cash sum in US dollars equal to that
corporation tax reduction converted to US dollars in accordance with
**paragraph 6(C)(v)** or, if the Vendor and the Purchaser agree, in
pounds sterling.

  

## (v) ** _ _**For the purposes of this **paragraph 6(C)** , where any
monetary sum is expressed in a currency other than US dollars, that amount
shall be translated into US dollars at the closing rate of exchange on the
last Business Day prior to the date of payment under the relevant provision
of this **paragraph 6(C)** as published by Bloomberg, or, where no such rate
of exchange is published in respect of that date, at the rate quoted by
Reuters **** as at close of business on that date. For these purposes, what
constitutes a "Business Day" will be determined by reference to days on which
banks are open for business in London (other than solely for trading and
settlement in euros), but not taking into account whether banks are open in
New York or The Netherlands.

  

 **7.** ** ****_VOLUNTARY FUND_**

  

 **(A)** ** ****_Meaning of "Voluntary Fund"_**

  

In this **paragraph 7**, the expression **"Voluntary Fund"** means a fund
comprising those voluntary contributions, or the investments or moneys
representing them and any income derived from them, in respect of which the
entitlements of the members who have paid them are not related to earnings
(however defined) but are based on the respective parts of such Voluntary
Fund which are attributable to them.

  

 **(B)** ** ****_Voluntary Fund to be disregarded for calculations_**

  

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Schedule, if within the
Vendors Scheme there is a Voluntary Fund, the Voluntary Fund, the benefits
payable from it, the contributions payable to it and any transfer payment
made from it shall be disregarded for all the preceding provisions of this
Schedule.

     

   



  

 **(C)** ** ****_Transfer of Voluntary Fund_**

  

The Vendor shall nevertheless use its reasonable endeavours to procure that
the part of the Voluntary Fund attributable to the Transferring Members in
accordance with the provisions of the Vendors Scheme is transferred to the
Purchasers Scheme on the Payment Date.

  

 **8.** ** ****_TRANSFER AMOUNT TO PURCHASE BENEFITS FOR TRANSFERRING
MEMBERS_**

  

Subject to receipt of the Transfer Amount (as reduced in accordance with the
final sentence of **paragraph 6(B)**, if applicable) by the Purchasers
Scheme (and, where applicable, the payment of the Gross Shortfall by the
Vendor under **paragraph 6(C)**), the Purchaser shall procure that
the Purchasers Scheme shall provide benefits in respect of the pensionable
service (including transfer credits) of each Transferring Member in the
Vendors Scheme before Completion which are identical to the benefits
applying in the Vendors Scheme (as in force on the date of this Agreement)
in relation to such service.

  

 **9.** ** ****_DISPUTES_**

  

 **(A)** ** ****_Referral to an independent Actuary_**

  

(i) Any dispute between the Vendors Actuary and the Purchasers Actuary
concerning the determination or agreement of the Transfer Amount or of any
other matters to be determined or agreed by them for the purposes of this
Schedule shall, in the absence of agreement between them, be referred to an
independent Actuary.

  

(ii) The independent Actuary shall be nominated jointly by the Vendor and
the Purchaser or, failing such nomination, shall be nominated by the
President for the time being of The Institute of Actuaries at the instance of
the party first applying to him. If the independent Actuary is unable to
agree the terms of his appointment with the Vendor and the Purchase jointly,
the terms of his appointment shall be agreed between him and the Vendor.

  

 **(B)** ** ****_Independent Actuary to act as expert and direct payment of
costs_**

  

The independent Actuary so appointed shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. His decision shall be final and binding. His costs shall be borne
between the Vendor of the one part and the Purchaser of the other part as the
independent Actuary may direct.

  

 **10.** ** ****_NO ASSISTANCE TO BE GIVEN BY THE PURCHASER_**

  

 **(A)** ** ****_No assistance to be given which would result in an amount
larger than the Transfer Amount being payable_**

  

(i) The Purchaser undertakes neither to take any action nor to assist,
whether directly or indirectly, any person in any manner which would result
in the Vendors Scheme having to pay a larger amount than the Transfer Amount
to the Purchasers Scheme.

     

   



  

(ii) The Purchaser agrees that this undertaking extends to the Purchaser
and any other company directly or indirectly controlled or connected with
the Purchaser.

  

 **(B)** ** ****_Purchaser s Scheme trust deed and rules to require
Purchaser to approve acceptance of transfer payment_**

  

The Purchaser undertakes to the Vendor:

  

(i) that on and after the Completion Date the trust deed and rules of the
Purchasers Scheme will require that the Purchaser must approve the
acceptance of any transfer payment to be made by the Vendors Scheme to the
Purchasers Scheme pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agreement; and

  

(ii) that it will not give such approval to the extent that the total
payment proposed to be made to the Purchasers Scheme by the Vendors Scheme
exceeds an amount equal to the Transfer Amount for any reason including
without limitation any statutory or other requirement that transfer values be
of a minimum amount.

  

 **11.** ** ****_CALCULATION OF LIABILITY_**

  

In quantifying any liability, damage, cost, claim or expense which either
party may incur or sustain arising out of or in connection with the breach by
the other of any of the provisions of this Schedule, the parties agree that
the Actuarial Assumptions shall be applied as nearly as may be and in default
of agreement as to how they should apply, the disagreement shall be resolved
in accordance with **paragraph 9**.

  

 **12.** **_THIRD PARTY RIGHTS_**

  

## (A) Certain of the provisions of this Schedule confer a benefit on the
persons specifically referred to in that provision (each a **"Third Party"**
) and, subject to **paragraph 12(B),** are intended to be enforceable by
each Third Party by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
1999.

  

(B) Notwithstanding **paragraph 12(A),**  such provisions may be rescinded or
varied in any way and at any time by the parties to this Agreement without
the consent of any Third Party.

## 2.3 any Tax Liability in respect of any accounting period of the Company

### (D) carried out or effected in the ordinary course of the trade carried
on by the Company as at Completion; or

# **5.** ** TAX RELIEFS**

  

The Purchaser shall, at the direction in writing of the Covenantor, procure
that the Company take all such steps as the Covenantor may require to:-

  

## 5.1 use all Reliefs as are available to the Company, other than a
Purchasers Relief, to reduce or eliminate any Tax Liability in respect of
which the Purchaser would have been able to make a claim against the
Covenantor under this deed (such Reliefs including, without limitation,
Reliefs made available to a company by means of a surrender from another
company), the said use being to effect the reduction or elimination of any
such Tax Liability in the manner and to the extent specified by the
Covenantor and permitted by law, and to provide to the Covenantor, at the
Covenantors expense, a certificate from the auditors (for the time being) of
the Company confirming that all such Reliefs have been so used;

  

## 5.2 make all such claims and elections specified by the Covenantor in
respect of any accounting period of the Company commencing before Completion,
including so as to have the effect of reducing or eliminating any such Tax
Liability as is mentioned in _sub-clause 5.1_ or increasing the amount of
Group Relief available to be surrendered by the Company, provided that no
such claim or election shall require the Company to use any Purchasers
Relief; and

  

## 5.3 allow the Covenantor to reduce or eliminate any Tax Liability by
surrendering, or procuring the surrender by any company other than the
Company, of Group Relief to the Company to the extent permitted by law but
without any payment being made in consideration for such surrender.

  

# **6.** ** OVER-PROVISIONS, RELIEFS, ETC.**

  

## 6.1 If the auditors for the time being of the Company shall certify (at
the request and expense of the Covenantor) that any provision for Tax in the
Completion Statement (excluding any provision for deferred Tax) has proved to
be an over-provision, then the amount of such over-provision shall be dealt
with in accordance with _sub-clause 6.4_.

       



  

## 6.2 If the auditors for the time being of the Company shall certify (at
the request and expense of the Covenantor) that any Tax Liability which has
resulted in a payment having been made by or becoming due from the Covenantor
under this deed has given rise to a Relief for the Company which would not
otherwise have arisen and that Relief has reduced or eliminated a liability
of the Company or any member of the Purchasers Group to make an actual
payment of Tax, then the amount of that Relief shall be dealt with in
accordance with _sub-clause 6.4_; provided that if the Relief in question is
a deduction from or offset against Income, Profits or Gains, the amount to be
so dealt with shall be a sum equal to the amount of Tax saved through the use
of that Relief on the basis of the rates of Tax current at the date of the
certification made by the auditors under this _sub-clause_.

  

## 6.3 The Purchaser shall notify the Covenantor as soon as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of any right to repayment or actual repayment
of Tax from any Tax Authority to which the Company is or becomes entitled or
which it receives in respect of an Event occurring or period falling prior to
Completion (including any repayment attributable to the surrender of Group
Relief in respect of a period ending on or before Completion whenever such
surrender is effected), where or to the extent that such right or repayment
was not included in the Completion Statement as an asset, does not arise from
the use of a Purchasers Relief, is not a payment or Relief to which _Clause
7_ (RECOVERY FROM OTHER PERSONS) below applies, and is not paid over or taken
into account under any other provision of this deed (a " ** _Tax Refund_**
") and the amount of any such Tax Refund (whether paid as such or discharged
by set off) shall be dealt with in accordance with _sub-clause 6.4_.

  

## 6.4 Where it is provided under _sub-clause 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3_ that
any amount (the " ** _Relevant Amount_** ") is to be dealt with in
accordance with this _sub-clause_ :-

  

### (A) the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any payment then
due from the Covenantor under this deed;

  

### (B) to the extent there is an excess, a refund shall be made to the
Covenantor of any previous payment or payments made by the Covenantor under
this deed and not previously refunded under this _Clause 6_ up to the amount
of such excess; and

  

### (C) to the extent that the excess referred to in _paragraph 6.4(B)_ is
not exhausted under that paragraph, the remainder of that excess shall be
carried forward and set off against any future payments which become due from
the Covenantor under this deed.

  

## 6.5 Where any such certification as is mentioned in _sub-clause 6.1 or
6.2_ has been made, the Covenantor or the Purchaser or the Company may (at
the expense of the party making the request) request the auditors for the
time being of the Company to review such certification in the light of
all relevant circumstances, including any facts which have become known only
since such certification, and to certify whether such certification remains
correct or whether, in the light of those circumstances, the amount that was
the subject of such certification should be amended.

  

## 6.6 If the auditors certify under _sub-clause 6.5_ that an
amount previously certified should be amended, that amended amount shall
be substituted for the purposes of _sub-clause 6.4_ as the

       



  

## Relevant Amount in respect of the certification in question in place of
the amount originally certified, and such adjusting payment (if any) as may
be required by virtue of the above-mentioned substitution shall be made as
soon as practicable by the Covenantor or (as the case may be) to the
Covenantor.

  

# **7.** ** RECOVERY FROM OTHER PERSONS**

  

If, in the event of any payment becoming due from the Covenantor under
_Clause 2_ (COVENANT), the Company either is immediately entitled at the due
date for the making of that payment to recover from any person (not being the
Company but including any Tax Authority) any sum in respect of the Tax
Liability that has resulted in that payment becoming due from the Covenantor,
or at some subsequent date becomes entitled to make such a recovery, then the
Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify the Covenantor of its entitlement and shall (if so
required by the Covenantor and subject to the Covenantor indemnifying
the Purchaser and the Company to their reasonable satisfaction against all
costs or expenses which may thereby be incurred and pursuant to such
indemnity paying to the Purchaser or the Company within a reasonable period
of demand an amount equal to any such costs or expenses as are so incurred)
take all reasonable steps to enforce that recovery (keeping the Covenantor
informed of the progress of any action taken); and if the Covenantor has made
a payment under _Clause 2_ (COVENANT) in respect of the Tax Liability in
question, the Purchaser shall account to the Covenantor for whichever is the
lesser of:-

  

### (A) any sum so recovered by the Company in respect of that Tax Liability
(including any interest or repayment supplement paid by the Tax Authority or
other person on or in respect thereof, but less any Tax payable by the
Company in respect of that interest); and

  

### (B) the amount paid by the Covenantor under _Clause 2_ (COVENANT) in

as reasonably practicable give written  details of the Claim to the
Covenantor or, as the case may be, shall procure that the Company give
written details of that Claim as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Covenantor, and (subject to the Covenantor indemnifying the Purchaser and the
Company to their reasonable satisfaction against all losses, costs, damages
and expenses, including interest on overdue Tax, which have been incurred
thereby and pursuant to such indemnity paying to the Purchaser or the Company
within a reasonable period of demand an amount equal to any such losses,
costs, damages and expenses as are so incurred) the Purchaser shall further
procure that the Company take such action and give such information and
assistance in connection with the affairs of the Company as the Covenantor
may reasonably and promptly by written notice request to avoid, resist,
appeal or compromise the Claim;

#### (ii) have a material adverse effect on the business of any member of the
Purchasers Group (but excluding any effect on such members dealings with
any Tax Authority);

, to take that action;

  

### (C) in the case of the Covenantor requesting that the Company appeal to
the High Court against a decision of the Special Commissioners or the VAT and

counsel that there is a reasonable prospect that the appeal will succeed;

  

### (D) where legal proceedings are started to put the Covenantor into

against the Covenantor under this deed in respect of any such Tax Liability
as is mentioned in _Clause 2_ (COVENANT).

  

# **10.** ** DUE DATE OF PAYMENT**

  

## 10.1 Where the Covenantor becomes liable to make any payment under this
deed, the due date for the making of that payment (in cleared funds) shall
be:-

  

### (A) in a case that involves an actual payment of Tax by the Company, the
date falling two Business Days before the last date on which the Company
would have had to have paid to the appropriate Tax Authority the Tax that has
given rise to the Covenantors liability under this deed in order to avoid
incurring a liability to interest or a charge or penalty in respect of that
Tax Liability; or

  

### (B) in any other case, the date falling five Business Days after the date
when the Covenantor have been notified by the Company or the Purchaser that
the auditors for the time being of the Company have certified, at the request
of the Purchaser or the

       



  

### Company, that the Covenantor has a liability for a determinable amount
under _Clause 2_ (COVENANT).

  

## 10.2 If any payment required to be made by the Covenantor under this deed
is not made by the due date for the making thereof, then, except to the
extent that the Covenantors liability under _Clause 2_ (COVENANT)
compensates the Purchaser for the late payment by virtue of its extending to
interest and penalties, that payment shall carry interest from that due date
until the date when the payment is actually made at the Agreed Rate on the
basis of a 365-day year and actual days elapsed, and to accrue daily (but
without compounding).

  

# **11.** ** DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYMENTS, ETC.**

save only as may be required by law.

  

## 11.2 If any deductions or withholdings are required by law to be made from
any of the sums payable as mentioned in _sub-clause 11.1_, the
Covenantor shall be obliged to pay to the Purchaser such sum as will, after
the deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Purchaser with the same
amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such
requirement to make a deduction or withholding.

  

## 11.3 If any sum payable by the Covenantor to the Purchaser under this deed
(other than interest under _Clause 10_ (DUE DATE OF PAYMENT) shall be
subject to a Tax liability in the hands of the Purchaser, the Covenantor
shall be under the same obligation to make an increased payment in relation
to that Tax liability as if the liability were a deduction or withholding
required by law.

  

## 11.4 If the Purchaser has assigned the whole or part of the benefit of
this deed, then _sub-clauses 11.2 and 11.3_ shall only apply to the extent
that the Covenantor would have been obliged to make such payment or payments
had no such assignment occurred.

  

## 11.5 If the Purchaser receives a credit for or refund of any Tax by reason
of any deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax in respect of
payments made under this deed it shall reimburse to the Covenantor such part
of such additional amounts paid to it pursuant to this _sub-clause 11.2 and
11.3_  above as the Purchaser certifies to the Covenantor will leave it
(after such reimbursement) in no better and no worse position than it would
have been if the Covenantor had not been required to make such deduction or
withholding.

  

# **12.** ** SURRENDER OF GROUP RELIEF**

  

## 12.1 The Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall surrender (to the
extent permitted by law) to the Covenantor or to such other member of the
Covenantors Group as the Covenantor may specify all such Group Relief as the
Covenantor may at its sole discretion direct in writing in respect of the
Straddle Period and any prior accounting period of the Company.

  

## 12.2 The Purchaser hereby undertakes that it shall, and shall procure that
the Company will, use all reasonable endeavours to procure that full effect
is given to the surrenders to be made under

       



  

## _sub-clause 12.1_ and that such surrenders are allowed in full by HM
Revenue and Customs and (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing)
the Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall sign and submit to HM
Revenue and Customs all such notices of consent to surrender (including
provisional or protective notices of consent in cases where any relevant Tax
computation has not yet been agreed) and all such other documents and returns
as may be necessary to secure that full effect is given to this _Clause 12_.

  

## 12.3 In consideration of each of the surrenders to be made under _sub-
clause 12.1_, the Covenantor shall pay to the Company or, as the case may
be, shall procure that the relevant member of the Covenantors Group shall
pay to the Company a sum equal to the amount of corporation Tax from which
the relevant claimant company has been relieved by virtue of that surrender
being validly and effectively made; PROVIDED THAT the provisions of this
_sub-clause_  shall not have effect if and to the extent that payment in
respect of any such surrender has been made on the basis specified in the
foregoing provisions of this _sub-clause_ on or before the date of this deed.

  

## 12.4 Any sum payable under _sub-clause 12.3_ shall be paid on the date
on which any corporation Tax chargeable on the taxable profits of the
relevant claimant company for the accounting period to which the relevant
surrender relates becomes due and payable (or would have become due and
payable had the Company incurred any liability to corporation Tax in respect
of that accounting period).

  

## 12.5 In the event that any payment is made in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this _Clause 12_ in respect of any surrender of Group
Relief made under _sub-clause 12.1_ and corporation Tax falls nevertheless
to be charged in respect of the taxable profits that the relevant surrender
was intended to relieve from such Tax (whether as a result of HM Revenue and
Customs refusing to allow Group Relief or subsequently withdrawing Group
Relief in respect of the relevant surrender or for any other reason
whatsoever), the Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall forthwith
repay to the Covenantor or to the relevant member of the Covenantors Group
either the sum previously paid in respect of the relevant surrender in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Clause 12_ or, as the case
may be, such part of that sum as is attributable to the element of the
surrender that did not have the effect of relieving from corporation Tax the
taxable profits intended to be relieved by virtue of that surrender.

  

## 12.6 The Purchaser shall pay to the Covenantor by way of an adjustment to
the consideration payable under the Agreement for the Shares an amount equal
to the payment required to be made by the Covenantor or other member of the
Covenantors Group pursuant to _sub-clause 12.3_ on the same date that such
payment is made.

  

## 12.7 The Covenantor shall pay to the Purchaser by way of an adjustment to
the consideration payable under the Agreement for the Shares an amount equal
to any payment required to be made by the Company pursuant to _sub-clause
12.5_  on the same date that such payment is made.

  

## 12.8 The Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall claim (to the
extent permitted by law) from the Covenantor or from such member of the
Covenantors Group as the Covenantor may

       



  

## specify such Group Relief as the Covenantor may at its sole discretion
direct in writing in respect of the Straddle Period and any prior accounting
period of the Company provided that nothing in this _sub-clause_ or _sub-
clause 12.9_ shall require the Company to make any payment in consideration
for such surrender.

  

## 12.9 The Purchaser hereby undertakes that it shall, and shall procure that
the Company will, use all reasonable endeavours to procure that full effect
is given to the claims to be made under _sub-clause 12.8_ and that such
claims are allowed in full by HM Revenue and Customs and (without prejudice to
the generality of the foregoing) the Purchaser shall procure that the Company
shall sign and submit to HM Revenue and Customs all such claims and other
documents and returns as may be necessary to secure that full effect is given
to _sub-clause 12.8_.

  

# **13.** ** COUNTER COVENANT**

  

## 13.1 The Purchaser covenants with the Covenantor to pay to the Covenantor
an amount equal to any of the following:-

  

### (A) any liability or increased liability to Tax of the Covenantor or any
other member of the Covenantors Group which arises as a result of or by
reference to any reduction or disallowance of Group Relief validly
surrendered by the Company that would otherwise have been available to the
Covenantor or other member of the Covenantors Group where and to the extent
that such reduction or disallowance occurs as a result of or by reference
to:-

  

#### (i) any total or partial withdrawal effected by the Company after
Completion of any surrender of Group Relief validly made;

  

#### (ii) any total or partial disclaimer made by the Company after
Completion of any capital allowances available to the Company in respect of

#### (iii) any breach by the Purchaser of its obligations under _Clause 9_
(TAX RETURNS)

  

save where any such withdrawal or disclaimer as is referred to in _sub-
paragraphs (i) and (ii)_ above is made at the express written request, or
with the express written approval, of the Covenantor;

  

### (B) any liability or increased liability to Tax of the Covenantor or any
member of the Covenantors Group which arises as a result of or by reference
to the making or giving or the amendment by the Purchaser or the Company at
any time after Completion of any election, claim, surrender, disclaimer,
notice, consent, or any Tax return, in each case, validly made, given or
completed and relating wholly or partly to the Straddle Period or any prior
accounting period, save where any such action is made at the express written
request, or with the express written approval, of the Covenantor;

       



  

### (C) the liability of any member of the Covenantors Group to make a

member of the Covenantors Group which arises as a consequence of or by

in or right over any asset;

  

#### (ii) the making by any Relevant Company of any such payment or deemed
payment as constitutes a chargeable payment for the purposes of section 214
ICTA;

  

#### (iii) any Relevant Company ceasing to be resident in the United Kingdom
for the purposes of any Tax; or

  

#### (iv) the effecting by any Relevant Company of any such payment or
transfer of assets as constitutes the receipt by another person of an
abnormal amount by way of dividend (as defined in section 709 ICTA); or

  

#### (v) any Relevant Company failing to pay the whole of the Tax charged by
any Tax Assessment made in respect of that Relevant Company where (and to the
extent that) the liability for that Tax arises in circumstances such that
the Purchaser would not have been entitled to make a claim against the
Covenantor under _Clause 2_ (COVENANT) of this deed in respect of that Tax
had it been paid by the Relevant Company,

  

and, for the purposes of this _paragraph_ , the term " ** _Relevant Company_**
" shall mean the Purchaser or the Company and any other company which is, or
has at any time been, treated for the purposes of any Tax as being a member
of the same group of companies as the Purchaser or as being associated with
the Purchaser; and

  

### (E) any reasonable out-of-pocket legal and accounting costs and

member of the Covenantors Group (if the Purchaser shall indemnify the
Covenantor and any relevant member of the Covenantors Group to the
Covenantors reasonable satisfaction against all losses,

       



  

costs, damages and expenses, including interest on overdue Tax, which may be
incurred thereby) take such action and give such information and assistance
in connection with the affairs of the Covenantor or any relevant member of
the Covenantors Group as the Purchaser may reasonably and promptly by
written notice request to avoid, resist, appeal or compromise the Claim;
PROVIDED THAT the Covenantor shall not be obliged to appeal against any Tax
Assessment or to procure that any member of the Covenantors Group appeals
against any Tax Assessment if:

  

#### (i) the Purchaser, having been given written notice of the receipt of
that Tax Assessment in accordance with the preceding provisions of this
_sub-clause_ , has not within 15 Business Days thereafter provided
instructions in writing to the Covenantor or the relevant member of the
Covenantors Group, in accordance with the preceding provisions of this
_sub-clause_ , to make that appeal; or

  

#### (ii) the actions requested by the Purchaser are unlawful.

  

### (B) The actions which the Purchaser may reasonably request under
_paragraph 13.2(A)_ shall include (without limitation) the Covenantor or any
relevant member of the Covenantors Group applying to postpone (so far as
legally possible) the payment of any Tax or allowing the Purchaser to take on
or take over at its own expense the conduct of all or any proceedings of
whatsoever nature arising in connection with the Claim in question, and, if
the Purchaser takes on or takes over the conduct of proceedings, the
Covenantor shall provide or shall procure that any relevant member of the
Covenantors Group shall provide such information and assistance as the
Purchaser may reasonably require in connection with the preparation for and

clause 13.1_, the due date for the making of that payment shall be the date
falling two Business Days before the last date on which the Covenantor or, as
the case may be, any relevant member of the Covenantors Group would have had
to have paid to the appropriate Tax Authority the Tax that has given rise to
the Purchasers liability under _sub-clause 13.1_ in order to avoid
incurring a liability to interest or a charge or penalty in respect of that
amount of Tax.

  

### (B) If any payment required to be made by the Purchaser under _sub-clause
13.1_ is not made by the due date for the making thereof, then, except to the
extent that the Purchasers liability under _sub-clause 13.1_ compensates
the Covenantor for the late payment by virtue of its extending to interest
and penalties, that payment shall carry interest from that due date until the
date when the payment is actually made at the Agreed Rate on the basis of a
365-day year and actual days elapsed, and to accrue daily (but without
compounding).

  

13.4 (A) All sums payable by the Purchaser to the Covenantor under this
_Clause 13_  shall be paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings
whatsoever, save only as may be required by law.

amount as they would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such
requirement to make a deduction or withholding.

  

### (C) If any sum payable by the Purchaser to the Covenantor under this
_Clause 13_  (other than interest under _paragraph 13.3(B)_) shall be
subject to a liability to Tax in the hands of the Covenantor, the Purchaser

to that liability to Tax as if the liability were a deduction or withholding
required by law.

  

# **14.** ** TAX GROUPS**

  

## 14.1 The Covenantor and the Purchaser shall make all reasonable efforts to

Completion.

  

## 14.2 The Covenantor shall ensure that the nominated company of any group

input tax exceeds the relevant output tax (in either case, the " **
_Credit_** ") in respect of any supply of goods or services made to the
Company or any importation or acquisition made by the Company (in either
case, before the date on which the Company ceases to be a member of the

the relevant claim would not have arisen but for, results from or is
increased by matters which relate to:

  

### (a) except in relation to soil or groundwater contamination, the carrying
out of or the failure to carry out works after 2006 Completion which are
routine or recurring as a result of the normal and lawful operation of the
business of the Protected Person in a negligent manner or other than in
accordance with the standards of a Reasonable and Prudent Operator, but, for
the avoidance of doubt, not including any failure to carry out routine
maintenance in relation to a Discovery Window Defect prior to its discovery;

  

### (b) town and country planning (in the United Kingdom) or comparable land
use planning or zoning systems in other jurisdictions except to the extent
relating to Hazardous Materials or Waste;

  

### (c) any tax, duty or levy imposed or calculated in relation to claims
under paragraph 2.1(B).

     

   



  

## 6.2 In respect of any claim under the Part A1 Indemnities other than in
relation to Pre-2006 Completion Protected Matters and except in relation to
paragraphs 8.1(b) and 11.1(a), the Vendor shall not be liable to the extent
that the relevant claim would not have arisen but for, results from or is
increased by Future Environmental Laws, provided that the Vendor shall not be
entitled to exclude, avoid or reduce its liability under this Schedule 9 as a
result of Future Environmental Laws which are no more onerous than
Environmental Laws and references to Environmental Laws shall be interpreted
accordingly.

  

## 6.3 Any reference to liability under Environmental Laws or Future
Environmental Laws (as applicable) shall be deemed to include any contractual
obligation by which a Protected Person is responsible for or to contribute to
that liability, to the extent such obligation is in force and binding on the
relevant Protected Person at or prior to 2006 Completion or as the direct
result of the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  

 **MITIGATION**

  

## 7.1 The Purchaser and any relevant Protected Person shall mitigate any
Environmental Losses under this Schedule 9.

  

## 7.2 The Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim under the Part A1
Indemnities or the Part A2 Indemnities in respect of Environmental Losses

 **DISCLOSURE TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES**

  

## 8.1 Subject to paragraph 8.2 and 9 neither the Purchaser nor any member of
the Purchasers Group shall disclose any information in relation to any
matter which could reasonably be expected to be the subject of a claim under
the Part A1 Indemnities or the Part A2 Indemnities to any Governmental
Authority without the prior written consent of the Vendor except following
prior written notice to and consultation with the Vendor in relation to sub-
paragraphs (b) and (c) below:

  

### (a) in an Emergency where, because of the circumstances it is
impracticable to obtain the prior written consent of the Vendor; or

  

### (b) as required by law;

  

### (c) following the final determination by the expert under paragraph 13
(or earlier agreement between the parties) that there is a Significant
Environmental Impact;

  

### (d) in relation to Pre-2006 Completion Compliance Issues following the
final determination under paragraph 13.1 (or earlier agreement between the
parties) that there is a high likelihood that a Governmental Authority would
require any Protected Person to carry out Remedial Action ( **
_High Likelihood_** ).

  

## 8.2 The notice referred to in paragraph 8.1 shall contain specific
reasonable details of the matter proposed to be disclosed, the identity of
the Governmental Authority and individual officers to

     

   



  

## whom the disclosure is to be made and the proposed manner and timetable
for disclosure (including any documents or presentations or drafts of the
same). The Vendor shall be given 30 days (or such lesser period which allows
compliance with the relevant law where paragraph 8.1(b) applies) in which to
review and comment on the proposals for disclosure and the Purchaser shall
have regard to and incorporate the reasonable requests of the Vendor in
relation to the proposed disclosure.

  

## 8.3 In the event that the Vendor withholds its consent to a disclosure

is of the opinion that there is a Significant Environmental Impact then
the provisions of paragraph 13.1 shall apply.

  

## 8.4 In the event that such disclosure is made, the provisions of paragraph
9.4 and 9.6 below shall apply mutatis mutandis.

  

 **CLAIMS PROCEDURE**

  

## 9.1 Upon the Purchaser becoming aware of a matter which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a claim for Environmental Losses under the Part
A1 Indemnities, the Part A2 Indemnities or the Part A3 Indemnities the
Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter notify the
Vendor by written notice. Without limiting the obligation of the Purchaser to
comply with this paragraph 9.1, the purpose of such notice shall be to alert
the Vendor to the existence of the relevant matter in order that the Vendor
may decide to exercise its rights in relation to conduct and such notice
shall (if the Purchaser wishes to proceed with a claim under this Schedule 9)
be accompanied by or followed by a notice under clause 3.7 or 3.18.

  

## 9.2 The Vendor shall have the right to conduct Environmental Proceedings
and Remedial Action in respect of any matter which could reasonably be
expected to become a claim under the Part A1 Indemnities, unless the Vendor
(i) notifies the Purchaser in writing within a reasonable time thereafter,
that it declines the right to conduct under this paragraph; or (ii) is in
breach of paragraph 9.10 in circumstances which would result in any material
Environmental Losses being incurred by the relevant Protected Person which
are not covered by a valid claim under this Schedule 9 and/or would
materially adversely affect the value of the Property or the goodwill or good
name of such Protected Person, in which event the Purchaser shall have
conduct.  For the avoidance of doubt the provisions of paragraph 9.6 shall
not apply to such conduct by the Vendor of Environmental Proceedings or
Remedial Action under this paragraph.

  

## 9.3 Subject to paragraph 9.10 below, the Vendor shall have the right at
any time to assume by written notice to the Purchaser conduct of all or any
part of any Environmental Proceedings or the carrying out of any Remedial
Action relating to or affecting any claim under the Part A1 Indemnities or
the Part A2 Indemnities provided that if the Vendor has assumed any such
conduct and the Vendor is in breach of paragraph 9.10 in the circumstances
described in paragraph 9.2 above the Purchaser shall be entitled to have
conduct.

  

## 9.4 The Purchaser shall promptly provide the Vendor with such reports,
documents, correspondence, information, assistance and facilities relating to
any Environmental Proceedings or Remedial Action or other matter for which
written notice has been given under paragraphs 3.7, 3.18 or 9.1 as the Vendor
may reasonably require the Purchaser to provide

     

   



  

## (including if required by the Vendor reasonable access to any Property or
so far as practicable adjacent or affected property) except that nothing in
this paragraph shall require any waiver of legal privilege or breach of any
duty of confidentiality excluding any duty of confidentiality between the
Purchaser (or the relevant Protected Person) and any consultant in respect of
or relating to Environmental Proceedings or Remedial Action or other matter
the subject of written notice under paragraph 9.1. Each party shall use its
reasonable endeavours to avoid assuming any duty of confidentiality which
would impede the efficient operation of this paragraph 9.

  

## 9.5 The Conduct Party shall be entitled to avoid, dispute, deny, defend,
resist, appeal, compromise or contest any Environmental Proceedings, or any
matter the subject of the relevant written notice (including, without
limitation, making counterclaims or other claims against third parties in its
own name) and to have the conduct of any Environmental Proceedings, and any
related Remedial Action or appeals or other matter the subject of the
relevant written notice but no admission of liability shall be made by or on
behalf of the Conduct Party and the Environmental Proceedings or other matter
the subject of written notice under paragraph 9.1 shall not be compromised,
disposed of or settled without, in each case, the consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and provided that
such consent shall not be withheld where the relevant settlement or agreement
satisfies the criteria in paragraph 4.2 (b) (including as to quantum of
Environmental Losses) and has been reached in accordance with this paragraph
9).

  

## 9.6 The Conduct Party (where the Purchaser is the Conduct Party) shall use
its reasonable endeavours to ensure that:

  

### (a) the other party shall be informed promptly of any information which
comes to the knowledge of the Conduct Party other than information which the
Conduct Party reasonably considers to be immaterial to the Environmental
Proceedings or any other matter the subject of the relevant written notice;

  

### (b) the other party shall be allowed a reasonable opportunity to review
and to comment upon any material reports documents and correspondence to be
prepared and provided by the Conduct Party to the other parties to, or to any

notice and the Conduct Party shall have regard to the views of the other
party on such reports, documents or correspondence;

  

### (c) the other party shall be provided with advance notice of and be
allowed to attend and participate in any material site visit meeting or
negotiation involving the Conduct Party (or any subsidiary of the Conduct
Party) and any other parties to, or the Governmental Authority hearing,
administering or involved in, any Environmental Proceeding or matter the
subject of the relevant written notice under paragraph 9.1 and if it so
requests and undertakes to pay for the reasonable cost of taking and
providing such notes the other party shall be provided promptly with
reasonably full and accurate but not verbatim notes of such visit meetings
negotiations which it does not attend and participate in;

   

150   

 

  

### (d) if the other party so requests, copies of all material correspondence
and documents passing between the Conduct Party and other parties to
the Environmental Proceedings or matter the subject of the relevant written
notice under paragraph 9.1 or provided by the Conduct Party to the
Governmental Authority hearing, administering or involved in the
Environmental Proceedings or matter the subject of the relevant written
notice under paragraph 9.1 shall be provided promptly to the other party;

  

### (e) subject to the other Party undertaking to pay the reasonable cost
thereof detailed written reports shall be provided to the other Party
regarding the status and progress of any Environmental Proceedings or any
other matter the subject of the relevant written notice under paragraph 9.1
as frequently and in such form and detail as the other party shall reasonably
require;

  

### (f) the other party shall be provided with reasonable notice of any
proposal by the Conduct Party or any third party (to the extent the Conduct
Party is aware of such proposal) to undertake Remedial Action PROVIDED THAT
this obligation shall not apply in case of an Emergency;

  

### (g) any Remedial Action carried out by the Conduct Party or any
contractor or subcontractor of the Conduct Party shall be carried out using
all reasonable skill and care;

  

### (h) the other party shall be allowed to send such representatives as the
other party may reasonably require to attend and inspect the carrying out of
Remedial Action whilst they are being carried out PROVIDED THAT such
representatives shall not interfere with the proper undertaking of the
Remedial Action or the operation of the relevant business or the activities
of any third party;

  

### (i) where an environmental expert is to be appointed the Conduct Party
shall consult with the other party and have regard to the other Partys views
on whom to appoint, the scope of the appointment and the terms and conditions
of appointment.

  

## 9.7 Each party shall comply with the reasonable requests of the other for
arrangements or procedures to maintain confidentiality or legal privilege in
relation to any matters arising out of or relating to any Environmental
Proceedings, Remedial Action or other matter the subject of written notice
under paragraph 9.1.

  

## 9.8 The other party shall give the Conduct Party or its agents or
contractors access to personnel, premises, chattels, documents and records as
the Conduct Party may reasonably request and allow without limitation entry
to premises to make such examination and investigations as the Conduct Party
may consider necessary, the taking of samples, measurements, photographs and
recordings of soil, air, water or substances and combinations of substances
at any Property, with the full co-operation of the other party, the
interviewing of any person the Conduct Party has reasonable cause to believe
to be able to give relevant information and the production of extracts,
papers and records in relation to any matter which is or is likely to be the
subject of a claim under the Part A1 and Part A2 Indemnities.

  

## 9.9 The other party shall in a timely fashion:

     

   



  

(a) provide the Conduct Party with such information as it may reasonably
require to enable it to assist in the conduct of Environmental Proceedings;

  

### (b) consult in good faith with the Conduct Party in relation to
Environmental Proceedings; and

  

### (c) provide the Conduct Party with such material information as comes to
the knowledge of the other Party and which relates to the Environmental
Proceedings.

  

## 9.10 Where the Vendor has conduct of all or any part of Environmental
Proceedings pursuant to paragraph 9.2 above, or assumes conduct of all or any
part of Environmental Proceedings pursuant to paragraph 9.3 above, the Vendor
shall (subject to appropriate arrangements to maintain confidentiality and
privilege):

  

### (a) provide reasonably frequent and reasonably detailed reports to the
other party regarding the progress of Environmental Proceedings or Remedial
Action;

  

### (b) allow the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
in advance on proposals for Remedial Action;

  

### (c) develop in consultation with the other party, proposals for Remedial
Action, having regard to the Vendors obligation at sub-paragraph (f) below;

  

### (d) have regard to and incorporate the reasonable requests of the other
party in relation to such Environmental Proceedings or Remedial Action
(unless any such request of the other party would in excess of the cost of
complying with (e) and (f) increase the amount of Purchasers claim or the
cost of the Remedial Action in excess of the cost of complying with (e) and
(f) in which case the Purchaser shall be liable to the Vendor for any such
increase in relation to such request which is accepted by the Vendor);

  

### (e) carry out Remedial Action in a proper and workmanlike manner
(including, in relation to any claims which are not the subject of a claim on

and every term of the leases of any of the Properties to the extent that such
terms are applicable) and proceed with the same in a timely manner and with
due diligence;

  

### (f) so far as reasonably practicable avoid or minimise interruption or
disruption to the business carried on at any of the Properties;

  

### (g) if so requested by the Purchaser (a) carry out any intrusive

the criteria in paragraph 8 are satisfied. Any right of the Purchaser to
claim under this Schedule 9 which would have arisen had the Purchaser

be adversely affected or reduced as a result of any unreasonable delay in
complying with any such request (the assessment of reasonableness to take
account of all relevant matters including the effect of any such delay on the
Purchasers claim under this Schedule 9, or the claim which the Purchaser
would have had, but for such

     

   



  

### delay having regard to when the Purchaser might reasonably have been
expected to have carried out such work or made such disclosure had the
Purchaser retained conduct).

  

 **STANDARD OF WORKS**

  

## 10.1 The Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim under the Part A1
Indemnities or the Part A2 Indemnities in respect of the cost of carrying out
Remedial Action except for the reasonable costs of such Remedial Action which
are the minimum necessary:

  

### (a) to comply with the Final notice, order or requirement of a
Governmental Authority acting under Environmental Law or (in relation to
Pre-2006 Completion Protected Matters or Part A2 Indemnity Matters) Future
Environmental Law or a settlement or agreement under paragraph 4.2; or

  

### (b) to address the Emergency (which for the avoidance of doubt excludes

reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for Environmental Losses
neither the Purchaser, Protected Persons nor the Vendor or any member of the
Vendors Group shall make any public statements (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any statement to any Governmental Authority, unless required by law
or in an Emergency) regarding such circumstances without first discussing
with the other party and reaching written agreement on the text of any such
public statement before it is made,

     

   



  

## such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either Party
and without prejudice to paragraph 8.1.

  

 **DISPUTES**

  

## 13.1 If any dispute arises between the Vendor and the Purchaser as to:

  

### (a) whether or not an Emergency arose; or

  

### (b) whether or not a High Likelihood exists; or

  

### (c) whether or not a Significant Environmental Impact has occurred; or

  

### (d) whether a matter is to be deemed to be Substantially Pre-1999 for the
purposes of Part C,

  

the matter shall be referred for final determination in accordance with the
Criteria, at the request of either of the Vendor or the Purchaser to an
independent environmental consultant having experience relevant to the matter
in dispute as agreed between the Vendor and the Purchaser or in default of
any such agreement within seven days of such request by the Vendor or the
Purchaser, nominated in accordance with the criteria set out below at the
request of either the Vendor or the Purchaser by or on behalf of the
Chief Executive of the Environmental Auditors Registration Association or, if
he or she is unable to make a nomination within 28 days (or 14 days in the
case of a dispute as to whether a matter is Substantially Pre-1999 for the
purposes of Part C) of the request made to him or her, by the President for
the time being of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. Such independent
environmental consultant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and
his fees and expenses shall be borne as he shall direct.

  

## 13.2 The criteria referred to and to be applied in the nomination of the
independent environmental consultant shall be that he shall not have less
than 10 years experience relevant to the matter in issue and he shall be a
member of a company or firm which has been established for at least three
years preceding the date of the nomination.

  

## 13.3 The said environmental consultant shall be offered the appointment
within seven business days of the parties reaching agreement on the
appointment or upon nomination by the Chief Executive of the Environmental
Auditors Registration Association or President of the Chartered Institute of
Arbitrators as the case may be, he can only be dismissed by the mutual
agreement of the Vendor and the Purchaser. The said environmental consultant
shall present his written determination within 28 days (or 14 days in the
case of a dispute as to whether a matter is Substantially Pre-1999 for the
purposes of Part C) of his appointment or nomination or such longer period as
the Vendor and the Purchaser may mutually agree.

  

## 13.4 The terms of appointment of the environmental consultant will include
a provision that neither the Vendor nor the Purchaser will engage the
environmental consultant or any consultancy firm with which he is associated
after his nomination in relation to the relevant matter without the written
consent of the other party.

     

   



  

## 13.5 The decision of the said environmental consultant in relation to the
matters referred to in paragraph 13.1 shall in the absence of manifest error
be final and binding on the parties hereto.

  

 **PART B: PRE-1999 MATTERS UNDER THE CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT**

  

## 14.1 The Purchaser shall only be entitled to claim under the Part A1
Indemnities or Part A2 Indemnities in relation to any Pre-1999 Matters on the
basis set out in Part D and Part E and subject to and after the application
of the provisions set out in Part C for a claim or claims to be made by the
Vendor or any member of the Vendors Group for the benefit of the Purchaser
against ICI under the Contribution Agreement in relation to Pre-1999 Matters
on the Further Protected Person Basis.

bona fide believes could give rise to a claim on the Further Protected Person
Basis (irrespective of the strength or merits of the potential claim) the
Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter notify the
Vendor by written notice. The purpose of such notice shall be to alert the
Vendor to the existence of the relevant matter and the possibility of a claim
being made on the Further Protected Person Basis.

  

## 15.3 The parties agree that the relevant claim in relation to a matter
notified under paragraph 15.2 shall be brought on the Further Protected
Person Basis if:

  

### (a) the parties agree that the subject matter of the relevant claim is
Substantially Pre-1999; or

  

### (b) in default of agreement it is determined under the Expert Procedure
in Part A that on the basis of the available evidence (irrespective of the
strength or merits of the potential claim) such matter reasonably appears to
be Substantially Pre-1999:

  

For the purposes of this paragraph 15.3, a matter shall be deemed to
reasonably appear to be Substantially Pre-1999 if on the basis of the
available information as at as the date of the relevant determination under
the Expert Procedure in Part A it is reasonably likely that such matter
comprises or relates substantially to Pre-1999 Matters.  For the avoidance
of doubt, any agreement or determination under this paragraph 15.3 that a
matter shall be deemed to be Substantially Pre-1999 shall be binding on the
parties for the purposes of determining whether or not a claim shall be
brought on the Further Protected Person Basis under this Part C but shall not
preclude a claim being brought by the Purchaser under the Part A1 Indemnities
or Part A2 Indemnities in the circumstances provided for in paragraph 15.8
below.

Vendors Group shall comply with all requests of the Purchaser in relation to

unlawful act or omission;

  

### (c) excluding any request which would entail the Vendor or any member of
the Vendors Group making any payment, settling or withdrawing any claim by a
member of the Vendors Group under the ICI Indemnity (other than a claim made
on the Further Protected Person basis under this schedule 9) or otherwise
offering any other benefit of a similar nature to ICI in order to achieve a
favourable outcome for the Purchaser or the relevant Protected Person.

  

## 15.6 Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 15.5, where the
Vendor or the relevant member of the Vendors Group has conduct of a claim on
the Further Protected Person Basis, the Vendor shall and shall procure that

representatives shall not interfere with the proper undertaking of
the Remedial Action or the operation of the relevant business or the
activities of any third party;

  

### (i) where an environmental expert is to be appointed the Vendor or the
relevant member of the Vendors Group shall consult with the Purchaser and

claims to be made or pursued under the Part A1 Indemnities or the Part A2
Indemnities shall be deemed to be suspended as at the date it is agreed or
determined under paragraph 15.3 that a claim shall be brought on the Further
Protected Person Basis. Such suspension shall extend until it is reasonable to
conclude on an objective basis that the claim being brought by the relevant
member of the Vendors Group on the Further Protected Person basis no longer
has a reasonable chance of success.

Indemnities or the Part A2 Indemnities comes to be made in relation to a
matter which in whole or in part has been subject to a claim on the Further
Protected Person Basis, the Purchaser shall be entitled in its claim under
the Part A1 Indemnities or the Part A2 Indemnities to allege that

that such matter is deemed to be Substantially Pre-1999 and, to the extent
permitted by law, the Vendor and the Purchaser and any Protected Persons and
any third party shall be excluded from producing such determination before
any subsequent expert procedure, arbitration, dispute resolution, judge in a
court of law or any other legal or quasi-legal form of resolution.

  

## 15.10 Where any claim is made by the relevant member of the Vendors Group
on the Further Protected Person basis and is subsequently brought under the
Part A1 Indemnities or Part A2 Indemnities as applicable, the conduct
provisions set out at paragraphs 7 and 9 shall be applied in a reasonable
manner taking account of information available and actions taken in the
course of the claim made on the Further Protected Person Basis, provided that
this paragraph is without prejudice to paragraph 15.9.

  

 **PART D: TOP UP PAYMENTS IN RELATION TO PRE-1999 MATTERS **

  

## 16.1 This Part D relates to circumstances in which a claim against ICI
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser for Environmental Losses (as defined in
the Contribution Agreement) is reduced or avoided as a result of the
application of:

  

### (a) the reference in the definition of Environmental Law in Part A of
Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement to "Closing" (as defined under the
Contribution Agreement); and/or

  

### (b) the percentage share provisions in paragraph 3.2 (ii) of Part A of
Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement; and/or

  

### (c) the £3,000,000 threshold in paragraph 3.4(ii) of Part A of Schedule
14 of the Contribution Agreement; and/or

  

### (d) the limitation in relation to voluntary renewal by a Protected Person
after "Closing" (as defined under the Contribution Agreement) of any lease
set out in paragraph 5(viii) of Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement;
and/or

     

   



  

### (e) the limitation in relation to intrusive Investigative Works set out
in paragraph 5(xiii) of Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement; and/or

  

### (f) the limitation relating to any Contractual Obligation entered into
after "Closing" (as defined under the Contribution Agreement) set out in
paragraph 5(xv) of Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement.  

  

### (together the " **Relevant Contribution Agreement Provisions** ").

  

## 16.2 If and to the extent that Environmental Losses in relation to
Pre-1999 Matters:-

  

### (a) would have been recoverable under the Contribution Agreement but for
the Relevant Contribution Agreement Provisions;

  

### (b) and such Environmental Losses are not recoverable under the
Contribution Agreement solely as a result of the Relevant Contribution
Agreement Provisions,

  

### (c) then the Vendor undertakes to pay to the Purchaser the Top-up Payment
in respect of such unrecoverable Environmental Losses (as defined under Part
A of Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement) calculated on the basis set
out in paragraph 16.3 below. Such payment shall be made as payment under the
Part A1 Indemnities or Part A2 Indemnities as applicable.

  

## 16.3 The Top-up Payment shall be calculated on the basis of such
additional Environmental Losses as would have been recoverable from ICI under
the Contribution Agreement if they were assumed to have been amended as shown
in the third column of the relevant table set out below:

 **PART E: APPLICATION OF PART A1 INDEMNITIES OR PART A2 INDEMNITIES IN
RELATION TO PRE-1999 MATTERS**

  

## 17. This Part E relates to circumstances in which a claim on the Further
Protected Person Basis is not capable of being made, reduced or avoided as a
result of:

  

### (a) the arrangements set out in Part C not validly and effectively giving
the relevant member of the Vendors Group the right to claim in respect of
Environmental Losses on behalf of the relevant member of the Purchasers
Group, provided that this sub-paragraph (a) shall not apply:-

  

(i) where and to the extent there is no valid and effective right to claim as
a result of any change in circumstances or matters arising after 2006
Completion where such circumstances or matters arising are within the control
of the Purchasers or any member of the Purchasers Group (subject to sub-
paragraph (e)); and/or

  

### (ii) where and to the extent that the relevant Environmental Losses would
not have been recoverable irrespective of the arrangements set out in Part C,
unless and to the extent sub-paragraph (c), (d), (e) or (f) applies;

  

### (b) the Vendor or any member of the Vendors Group (including its
employees, contractors, agents, sub-tenants or licensees) failing to comply
with Part C;

     

   



  

### (c) any act or omission of the Vendor or any member of the Vendors Group
(including its employees, contractors, agents, sub-tenants or licensees)
before or after 2006 Completion (not being an act or omission which is
provided for in Part C);

  

### (d) any act or omission of the Company before 2006 Completion;

  

### (e) the benefit granted to the Vendor in respect of a Further Protected
Person under paragraph 16.2 of Schedule 14 of the Contribution Agreement
ceasing to apply as the result of a share transaction within the Purchasers
Group satisfying all of the following conditions:

  

(i) the Company remaining a fully and directly owned subsidiary of the
Purchaser following such transaction;

  

(ii) both the Purchaser and the Company remaining wholly owned subsidiaries
of a member of the Purchasers Group following such transaction; and

  

(iii) no subsequent transaction (connected with the first transaction) causes
the Company or the Purchaser to cease to be wholly owned subsidiaries of a
member of the Purchasers Group;

  

### (f) in the event of ICI Insolvency.

  

## 17.2 If and to the extent that a Halo Default or ICI Insolvency has arisen
and the relevant Environmental Losses would have been recoverable under the
Contribution Agreement but for such Halo Default or ICI Insolvency, then to
that extent the exclusion of claims under Part A1 Indemnities or the Part A2
Indemnities in respect of Pre-1999 Matters in paragraph 14.1 shall be deemed
to not apply and the Purchaser shall be entitled to claim under the Part A1
Indemnities or Part A2 Indemnities as applicable.

  

## 17.3 Where any claim is made by the relevant member of the Vendors Group
on the Further Protected Person basis and is subsequently brought under the
Part A1 Indemnities or Part A2 Indemnities as applicable, the conduct
provisions set out at paragraphs 7 and 9 shall be applied in a reasonable
manner taking account of information available and actions taken in the
course of the claim made on the Further Protected Person Basis.

  

 **PART F: POST-2006 COMPLETION COUNTER INDEMNITY**

  

## 18.1 The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Vendor and the Vendors
Guarantor for themselves and any member of the Vendors Group harmless on an
after Tax basis (" **Post-2006 Completion Counter Indemnity** ") from and
against any liability of any member of the Vendors Group to ICI in relation
to Post-2006 Completion Environmental Conditions under paragraph 14 (Post-
Closing Counter Indemnity) of Part A of Schedule 14 of the
Contribution Agreement.

  

## 18.2 The Purchaser acknowledges that conduct in relation to matters giving
rise to a claim by ICI against any member of the Vendors Group under
paragraph 14 (Post-Closing Counter Indemnity) of the Contribution Agreement
shall be governed by Part E of Schedule 14 of the

     

   



  

## Contribution Agreement. The Purchaser shall provide all necessary
information, access, facilities and assistance after 2006 Completion to
enable the relevant member of the Vendors Group to comply with its
obligations in relation to conduct under Part E of Schedule 14 of
the Contribution Agreement.

  

 **PART G: AGREED DEMOLITION AND THE AGREED DEMOLITION PROCEDURES**

  

## 19.1 The Purchaser shall be entitled in its sole discretion to decide
whether or not to decommission and/or demolish any or all of the Agreed
Demolition Units. If the Purchaser so decides in relation to one or more of
the Agreed Demolition Units then the provisions of this Part G shall apply.

  

## 19.2 If the Purchaser decides to decommission and/or demolish an Agreed
Demolition Unit, the Purchaser shall give prior written notice to the Vendor.
The Purchaser will consult in good faith with the Vendor in relation to the
proposed work plan for the proposed decommissioning and demolition in advance
of commencement and shall take reasonable account of comments provided by the
Vendor. The Purchaser shall ensure that the Vendor is provided with such
information as it reasonably requires in order for such consultation to take
place.

  

## 19.3 The Vendor shall be provided with a copy of the agreed demolition
work plan determined in accordance with paragraph 19.2 and shall be informed
of and consulted with in relation to any proposed changes.

  

## 19.4 The Vendor shall be provided with advance notice of commencement of
decommissioning and/or demolition and shall be provided with reasonable
opportunities to attend and inspect whilst work is being carried out and
shall be involved to a reasonable extent in the supervision of the work. The
Vendor shall be kept reasonably informed as to the progress of the work and
of any matters relevant to compliance with the following provisions of this
Part G.

  

## 19.5 The demolition and/or decommissioning in relation to an Agreed
Demolition Unit shall be carried out in accordance with the Agreed Demolition
Work Plan and shall be carried out reasonably and without negligence, having
regard to the need to minimise any Agreed Demolition Liabilities.

  

## 19.6 Subject to paragraphs 19.7 and 19.8 below, but without prejudice to
paragraph 19.5 above, the Agreed Demolition shall not extend beyond any
concrete slab or to other surface or sub-surface structures which do contain
or are reasonably likely to contain any Hazardous Materials or Waste.

  

## 19.7 Where the Agreed Demolition Unit includes surface or sub-surface
structures which contain or are reasonably likely to contain Hazardous
Materials or Waste (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any above ground
structures) then the Purchaser shall not remove such structure as part of the
Agreed Demolition unless taking into account any available information and
the need to minimize Agreed Demolition Liabilities the risk presented by such
structure is sufficient to justify intrusive investigation and the removal of
such structure. Subject to paragraph 19.8, intrusive investigations shall not
be carried out in relation to such structure.

     

   



  

## 19.8 If the removal of a structure reasonably appears to the Purchaser to
be justified on the basis set out in paragraph 19.7 above, the Purchaser
shall consult with the Vendor and the Vendor shall have the right to direct
that such structure is not removed and instead is purged, sealed or otherwise
so far as reasonably practicable (having regard to the need to minimize
Agreed Demolition Liabilities) is made safe without it being removed. The
Part A2 Indemnities shall apply to any such structure which is not removed
pursuant to a direction under this paragraph as and to the extent provided
for therein (for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations at paragraphs
5.1(a), 5.1(c) and 6.1(b) which are applicable to the Part A2 Indemnities
will only apply in the context of Sealed Structure Contamination to such
structures which are the subject matter of the direction of the Vendor under
this paragraph 19.8, once such direction has been given and Sealed Structure
Contamination shall not, at any time, be subject to Parts B, C, D and E of
this Schedule 9). However nothing in this paragraph 19.8 shall prejudice the
right and ability of the Purchaser to remove such structures if required by
law (including any Permit or the terms of any applicable lease) to do so,
although, where the Purchaser is required by law to remove such structures
then he shall as far as reasonably practicable consult with the Vendor and if
so requested by the Vendor the relevant Governmental Authority in respect of
the work being carried and shall have regard to the reasonable views of the
Vendor and the Governmental Authority.  Where the Purchaser, having regard at
all times to its obligations under this paragraph 19.8, is required to remove
such structure by law (including any Permit or the terms of any applicable
lease) at the time of or prior to the physical act of decommissioning or
demolishing an Agreed Demolition Unit under the Agreed Demolition Work Plan
then paragraph 3.16 of this Schedule 9 shall cease to apply to any claim
relating to the removal of such structure.

  

## 19.9 Where the Purchaser carries out any Remedial Action in connection
with the demolition and/or decommissioning at an Agreed Demolition Unit, the
Part A1 Indemnities and Part A2 Indemnities shall not apply to such Remedial
Action and the Purchaser shall carry out works in relation to such Remedial
Action as are the minimum necessary:

  

### (a) to comply with the Final notice, order or requirement of a
Governmental Authority acting under Future Environmental Law, a Permit
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any requirements under any Permit on
the cessation of operations and the surrender of such Permit if the relevant
Governmental Authority so requires) or a settlement or agreement under
paragraph 4.2 (mutatis mutandis); or

  

### (b) to address the Emergency (which for the avoidance of doubt excludes
anything other than such works as are necessary at the time of the Emergency
to (a) remove the direct cause of and (b) control the immediate effects of
the Emergency).

  

## 19.10 The costs of demolition and/or decommissioning shall be borne by the
Purchaser (including the removal of asbestos and any other environmental or
health and safety matters except as provided for in paragraph 19.11 below).

  

## 19.11 The Part A3 Indemnities shall apply in relation to an Agreed
Demolition Unit where and to the extent:-

  

### (a) notice is provided by the Purchaser to the Vendor on or before the
first anniversary of the Agreed Demolition Completion Date; and

     

   



  

### (b) a liability arises in relation to:

  

(i) any soil and groundwater contamination (but not including any Sealed
Structure Contamination); and/or

  

(ii) any Environmental Losses in relation to any structure or item of plant
or equipment (including any liquids or other materials contained therein)
(disregarding its size, age or complexity or the costs associated with its
decommissioning or demolition) where such structure or item of plant or
equipment (including any liquids or other materials contained therein) would
not usually be encountered in the context of decommissioning and/or
demolishing a petrochemicals unit,

  

in each case, existing at the Agreed Demolition Unit prior to 2006 Completion
as the direct result of carrying on the demolition and decommissioning in
accordance with this Part G.

  

## 19.12 For the avoidance of doubt, where the Purchaser carries out any
decommissioning and/or demolition not part of the Agreed Demolition and such
decommissioning and/or demolition results in Environmental Losses, the
Purchaser shall not by virtue of the Part G be prevented from making a claim
under the Part A1 Indemnities or Part A2 Indemnities in respect of such
Environmental Losses where the Environmental Losses did not occur as a direct
result of the decommissioning and/or demolition.

  

 **PART H: MISCELLANEOUS**

  

 **PAYMENT**

  

## 20.1 Any sums for which either party is liable under this Schedule 9 shall
be due and payable 30 days from the day following service of a proper invoice
in accordance with this Agreement.

  

 **PART I: 2006 FURTHER PROTECTED PERSONS**

  

## 21.1 In this Part I:-

the Vendor in accordance with paragraph 22.10 prior to the expiry of the
Discovery Window, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in favour of the
Purchaser and against the Vendor that such soil or groundwater is as
applicable Pre-2006 Completion Soil or Groundwater Contamination (as opposed
to Post-2006 Soil or Groundwater Contamination) or Pre-2006 North Tees Soil
or Groundwater Contamination (as opposed to Post-2006 Soil or Groundwater
Contamination). Such rebuttable presumption shall cease to apply if the
Vendor is able to prove on the balance of probabilities that such soil or
groundwater contamination is Post-2006 North Tees Soil or
Groundwater Contamination.

  

## 22.2 Where soil or groundwater contamination is discovered and notified to
the Vendor in accordance with paragraph 22.10 after the expiry of the
Discovery Window, it shall be for the Purchaser to prove on the balance of
probabilities that such soil or groundwater contamination is Pre-2006
Completion Soil or Groundwater Contamination or Pre-2006 North Tees Soil or
Groundwater Contamination (as opposed to applicable Pre-2006 Completion Soil
or Groundwater Contamination or Pre-2006 North Tees Soil or Groundwater
Contamination).

   

170   

 

  

Rebuttable presumptions in relation to Relevant Defects

  

## 22.3 Where any Relevant Defect in a pipe, drain, sump, interceptor or
other item of plant or equipment designed to contain liquid or other
materials at the relevant Property is discovered by the relevant Protected
Person (its employees, contractors, agents, sub-tenants or licensees) and
notified to the Vendor during the Discovery Window in accordance with
paragraph 22.10 there shall be a rebuttable presumption in favour of the
Purchaser and against the Vendor that such fracture, crack, or leak first
arose prior to 2006 Completion. Such rebuttable presumption shall cease to
apply if the Vendor is able to prove on the balance of probabilities that
such fracture, crack, leak or other defect first arose after 2006 Completion.

  

## 22.4 Where any Relevant Defect in a pipe, drain, sump, interceptor or
other item of plant or equipment designed to contain liquid or other
materials at the relevant Property is discovered by the relevant Protected
Person (its employees, contractors, agents, sub-tenants or licensees) after
the Discovery Window it shall be for the Purchaser to prove on the balance of
probabilities that such Relevant Defect first arose on or prior 2006
Completion.

  

## 22.5 The Purchaser shall procure that the relevant Protected Person
carries out any repair, replacement or other corrective action in relation to
a pipe, drain or other item of plant or equipment promptly following the
discovery of a Discovery Window Defect. Following completion of such work
(or the failure to complete such work promptly), the Discovery Window Period
shall be deemed to have ceased in relation to that section or part of the
pipe, drain or other item of plant or equipment that was subject to the work
and there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that any subsequently
discovered Relevant Defect in relation to such pipe, drain or other item of
plant or equipment shall have arisen after the date of such repair,
replacement or other corrective action.

  

Procedure in relation to Discovery Window

  

## 22.6 The Vendor and the Purchaser agree that it is in their respective
best interests to ensure that they have equal access to an authoritative and
up to date record of matters potentially relevant to whether matters have
arisen before or after 2006 Completion as provided for in paragraphs 22.1 to
22.5 above (the "Shared Record") including without limitation:

  

### (a) soil and groundwater monitoring data;

  

### (b) records of spills and leaks;

  

### (c) records of leaks and repairs,

  

such information being referred to below as Shared Record Data.

  

## 22.7 The Vendor and Purchaser shall between the date of this Agreement and
2006 Completion agree on the identity of a suitable environmental consultancy
to compile and maintain the Shared Record and also the identity of the
individual senior consultant to take lead responsibility from the date of
this agreement for compilation and maintenance of the Shared Record
(respectively the "Shared Record Consultancy" and "Shared Record Consultant"
and together "SRC"). Failing such agreement the Shared Record Consultancy and
Shared Record

     

   

## 

  

## Consultant shall be determined by the Chief Executive of the Environmental
Auditors Registered Association and shall not be a firm which has or an
individual who has performed any substantial work for the Vendor or the
Purchaser or their respective Affiliates during the 5 year period preceding
their appointment. Should it become reasonably necessary at any future time
to replace the SRC the above procedure shall be applied mutatis mutandis.

  

## 22.8 The terms and conditions under which the SRC will act shall be
determined by the Vendor and Purchaser acting reasonably and the fees, cost
and expenses of the SRC shall be borne equally by the Vendor and the
Purchaser. The duration of such appointment shall be five years from the date
of 2006 Completion unless the parties agree in writing to extend such period.

  

## 22.9 The Vendor and the Purchaser and each member of their respective
groups shall and shall procure that all Shared Record Data in their
possession or coming into their possession in future during the Shared Record
Period is provided reasonably promptly to the SRC in such form as the SRC
shall reasonably request, provided that this paragraph shall not entitle or
oblige any person to breach any contractual or other duty to any third party
(including any obligation owed under the ICI Indemnity) and shall be subject
to appropriate arrangements to preserve confidentiality and privilege.

  

## 22.10 Save in the case of emergency, the Purchaser shall and shall procure
that any Protected Person shall notify in relation to the relevant Property
the SRC as soon and as fully as reasonably practicable of:

  

### (a) any proposal to carry out any assessment or investigation of soil or
groundwater;

  

### (b) integrity issues relating to containment of liquid or other
materials;

  

### (c) any known or suspected leaks or spills excluding minor leakages or
spillages which could not be expected to have an impact below 0.3m of the
soil sub-surface;

  

### (d) any works for preventing, removing, remedying, cleaning-up,
containing or ameliorating soil or groundwater contamination;

  

### (e) any action to take repair, replacement or other corrective action in
relation to a Discovery Window Defect;

  

### (f) any other current or proposed activity at the relevant Property which
is reasonably relevant to the Shared Record.

  

## 22.11 The Purchaser shall and shall procure that any Protected Person
shall provide the SRC with all such facilities, access and co-operation as
reasonably required in order for the Shared Record to be compiled and
maintained.

  

## 22.12 The Purchaser and the Vendor shall ensure that the Shared Record and
any updates to it is made available to each of them on an equal basis and in
such form and with such frequency as each shall reasonably request.
Accordingly any communication with the SRC in relation to the Shared Record
shall be simultaneously copied to the other party and the Vendor and

     

   

## 

  

## Purchaser shall agree acting reasonably a protocol for regular contact
with and updating from the SRC.

  

## 22.13 For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of paragraph 22.1 to
22.12 above do not impose any duty, right or obligation on the Vendor or
Purchaser to carry out, or agree to the carrying out of, intrusive
investigations or to allow the SRC to do so.

  

## 22.14 The Purchaser and the Vendor agree to discuss in good faith the
timing and content and other issues arising out of the making of an approach
after 2006 Completion to the freeholder of the North Tees Site (the "North
Tees Freeholder") in order to formalise the current basis upon which the
North Tees Freeholder provides monitoring data to the Company (a "Formalised
Monitoring Arrangement"), provided that:

  

### (a) such Formalised Monitoring Arrangement shall not impose any positive
contractual obligation on the North Tees Freeholder to monitor except as
provided for in the North Tees Site Protection and Monitoring Plan (as
amended or added to from time to time);

  

### (b) such Formalised Monitoring Arrangement shall not extend in terms of
location or methodology beyond the current level of monitoring provided for
in the North Tees Site Protection and Monitoring Plan;

  

### (c) such Formalised Monitoring Arrangement may subject to the provisions
of this paragraph below impose a positive obligation on the North Tees
Freeholder to disclose the results of such monitoring as it elects to carry
out in addition to monitoring as provided for in the North Tees Site
Protection and Monitoring Plan;

  

### (d) the Purchaser and the Vendor acknowledge that it shall be regarded as
of a paramount importance that the making of an approach in relation to
the Formalised Monitoring Arrangement and/or the existence and/or exercise of
any such arrangement shall not prejudice the potential availability of the
ICI Indemnity;

  

### (e) the Purchaser and the Vendor shall make reasonable efforts to
formulate a basis for such an approach that will not give rise to any such
prejudice as referred to in (d);

  

### (f) the Vendor shall consent to such an approach being made and to such
Formalised Monitoring Arrangement being entered into and exercised if and to
the extent that there is no reasonable prospect of any such prejudice as
referred to in (d).

  

### (g) the Vendor shall be consulted with fully in relation to any such
approach and in relation to any subsequent negotiation, agreement and
exercise of such Formalised Monitoring Arrangement.

1. **Conduct of business between signing and Completion**

  

(A) The Vendor shall notify the Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable
upon becoming aware of any matter which is more than likely to require
either:

  

(i) a variation to a Fixed Price Contract; or

  

(ii) the provision of goods or services by third parties (being persons other
than members of the Vendors Group) in respect of the LDPE Project otherwise
than pursuant to Fixed Price Contracts to the extent such is consistent with
the Project Financial Plan both as regards the stage which the LDPE Project
has then reached and the budget for the goods or services in question;

  

involving (or likely to involve) expenditure in excess of £100,000.

  

(B) The Vendor shall procure that:

  

(i) no variation/change order is made to any Fixed Price Contract prior to
Completion which will lead to additional expenditure by the Company of more
than £100,000 in any individual case; and

  

(ii) no commitment is entered into by the Company for the provision of goods
or services by third parties (being persons other than members of the
Vendors Group) in respect of the LDPE Project involving expenditure by the
Company of more than £100,000 in any individual case, except so far as is
consistent with the Project Financial Plan both as regards the stage which
the LDPE Project has then reached and the budget for the goods or services in
question;

  

except (in each case) with the prior written consent of the Purchaser (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and in any event, in
relation to a Fixed Price Contract, the Purchaser shall give its decision
within 10 Business Days).

  

(C) For the purposes of determining whether or not anticipated expenditure in
a currency other than sterling will exceed the sterling thresholds set out in
_paragraphs (A) and (B)_ above, the amount of the anticipated expenditure
will be converted to sterling at the spot exchange rate applying at that
time.

  

(D) Any expenditure incurred by the Vendor in breach of _paragraph
1(B)_ shall be excluded from Actual Expenditure for the purposes of
_paragraph 3(A)_. Any additional expenditure which is required to achieve
Project Completion as a result of the Purchaser unreasonably withholding or
delaying its consent where required under _paragraph 1(B)_  shall be deducted
from Forecast Expenditure for the purposes of _paragraph 3(A)_.

  

2. **Exchange Rates for determining Actual Expenditure and Forecast Expenditure**

  

(A) In order to determine the amount of Forecast Expenditure, the following
exchange rates (the " **Budgeted Exchange Rates** ") will be used to
translate amounts of expenditure paid or to be paid in currencies other than
US dollars into US dollars:

     

   



  

£1 : 1.49725;

  

£1 : $1.7967; and

  

1 : $1.2.

  

(B) In order to determine the amount of Actual Expenditure:

  

(i) amounts of Actual Expenditure paid in currencies other than US dollars on
or before 30 September 2006 will be translated into US dollars using the
Budgeted Exchange Rates; and

  

(ii) amounts of Actual Expenditure paid in currencies other than US dollars
in any calendar month after 30 September 2006 will be translated into US
dollars using the Vendors booking rates, being the closing rate of exchange
on the third Business Day prior to the end of the month preceding the month
in which such amounts are paid as published by Bloomberg, or, where no such
rate of exchange is published in respect of that date, at the rate quoted by
Reuters as at close of business in the UK on that date. For these purposes,
what constitutes a "Business Day" will be determined by reference to days on
which banks are open for business in London (other than solely for trading
and settlement in euros), but not in New York or The Netherlands.

  

3. **Actual Expenditure and Forecast Expenditure**

  

(A) If:

  

(i) the Actual Expenditure is greater than $208,000,000, then the Purchaser
shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the difference:

  

(a) plus the amount deducted from the Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Clause 4(a)(iv)(A)_ (if any); or

  

(b) less the amount paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor pursuant to _Clause
4(a)(iv)(B)_ (if any);

  

(ii) the Actual Expenditure is less than the $208,000,000, then the Vendor
shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the difference:

  

(a) less the amount deducted from the Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Clause 4(a)(iv)(A)_ (if any); or

  

(b) plus the amount paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor pursuant to _Clause
4(a)(iv)(B)_ (if any);

  

(iii) the Forecast Expenditure is greater than $360,000,000, then the Vendor
shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the difference, less the amount
deducted from the Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to _Clause 4(a)(v)_
(if any); and

     

   



  

(iv) the Forecast Expenditure is less than $360,000,000, then the Purchaser
shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the amount deducted from the
Initial Cash Consideration pursuant to _Clause 4(a)(v)_ (if any),

  

provided that the above payments shall be netted-off against each other and,
within five Business Days of the final agreement or determination of the
Actual Expenditure and the Forecast Expenditure, the Vendor shall be obliged
to pay the Purchaser the net balance or the Purchaser shall be obliged to pay
the Vendor the net balance, as the case may be, together with an amount equal
to interest on the net balance at the Agreed Rate (accrued daily) for the
period from the Completion Date to the date of payment. Any payment under
this sub-paragraph shall constitute an adjustment to the Initial Cash
Consideration.

  

(B) The Vendor and the Purchaser shall use reasonable endeavours to agree in
good faith the Forecast Expenditure prior to Completion.  Where Forecast
Expenditure has been so agreed prior to Completion, the following provisions
of this _paragraph 3_ shall apply only in relation to Actual Expenditure.

  

(C) Within 30 Business Days of Completion, the Vendor shall notify the
Purchaser of its calculation of Actual Expenditure and Forecast Expenditure,
together with reasonably detailed supporting figures. The Purchaser shall
notify the Vendor of any dispute in relation to any such amounts within 30
Business Days of the date of the Vendors notice and shall provide reasonable
details of the grounds for disputing such amounts and (so far as reasonably
practicable) of the amounts which the Purchaser believes in good faith to be
the correct amounts for such Actual Expenditure and Forecast Expenditure. The
Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed to the Actual Expenditure or
Forecast Expenditure (as the case may be) to the extent it does not so
dispute within 30 Business Days of the date of the Vendors notice.

  

(D) If the Vendor and the Purchaser are unable to agree the Actual
Expenditure or Forecast Expenditure within 30 Business Days of the date of
the Vendors notice referred to in _paragraph (C)_ above, then the
determination of Actual Expenditure and/or Forecast Expenditure (as the case
may be) shall be referred for determination to the Project Expert who shall
be instructed to notify both the Vendor and the Purchaser of his
determination and of the reasons for it within 20 Business Days of such
referral, and such instructions shall be in the form of the pro forma
instruction letter at Annex 2 to this Schedule. In making his determination
the Project Expert shall act as expert and not arbitrator and his
determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding
and deemed to have been accepted and approved by the Vendor and the Purchaser
and shall be deemed to constitute the Actual Expenditure and/or Forecast
Expenditure (as the case may be) for all purposes of this Agreement.  The
fees and costs of the Project Expert incurred under this _paragraph (D)_
shall be paid as to one-half by the Vendor and one-half by the Purchaser
unless otherwise directed by the Project Expert (who shall have the authority
to make such direction if he deems it equitable).

  

(E) For the purposes of determining and agreeing the Actual Expenditure or
Forecast Expenditure the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Company
shall, give the Vendor and the Project Expert reasonable access at all
reasonable times to all books and records relating to such Actual Expenditure
and/or Forecast Expenditure in their respective possession or control.

     

   



  

(F) In determining the Actual Expenditure and/or Forecast Expenditure the
definitions, principles, policies, procedures and methods and practices of
accounting set out in Attachment IV shall be applied.  In relation to the
Forecast Expenditure, the Project Expert shall change items in the Forecast
Expenditure only to the extent that they arise from the LDPE Forecasting Tool
not being applied properly.

 **SCHEDULE 10 : ANNEX 2 (FORM OF INSTRUCTION LETTER)**

  

To: [Project Expert]

  

[Date]

  

Dear Sirs,

  

We refer to the Share Purchase Agreement between, Huntsman Petrochemicals
(UK) Holdings (the "Vendor"), Huntsman International LLC, SABIC UK
Petrochemicals Holdings Limited (the "Purchaser") and SABIC Europe N.V., a
copy of which is enclosed herewith (the "Share Purchase Agreement"), and in
particular to _Schedule 10_ (Wilton LDPE Project) of the Share Purchase
Agreement.  Capitalised terms in this letter shall bear the meanings ascribed
to them in the Share Purchase Agreement (including _Schedule 10_)
unless otherwise defined in this letter.

  

The Vendor and the Purchaser have not been able to agree the [Actual
Expenditure] [and] [Forecast Expenditure] in accordance with _paragraph
2(C)_ of _Schedule 10_, and accordingly the determination of [Actual
Expenditure] [and] [Forecast Expenditure] is hereby being referred to you, as
the chosen "Project Expert", in accordance with _paragraph 3(D)_ of
_Schedule 10_.

  

In your determination of the [Actual Expenditure] [and] [Forecast
Expenditure], you must apply the definitions, principles, policies,
procedures and methods and practices of accounting set out in _Attachment
IV_ to the Share Purchase Agreement. [In relation to Forecast Expenditure,
you may change items in the Forecast Expenditure only to the extent that they
arise from the LDPE Forecasting Tool not being applied properly.]

  

Please notify us of your determination and the reasons for it within 20
Business Days of the date of this letter.

  

Your fees and costs shall be paid as to one-half by the Vendor and one-half
by the Purchaser unless you otherwise direct, and you have the authority to
make such direction if you deem it equitable.

  

Yours sincerely

       

    |

 **ATTACHMENT IV 
 (Completion Statement)**

  

 **Completion Statement in respect of Working Capital, Final Cash Amount,
Final Third Party Debt Amount and the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount**

  

 **Preparation of Completion Statement**

  

1. The Completion Statement shall be prepared and agreed in accordance with the provisions of _Clauses 5 and 6_ and this _Attachment IV_ _._

  

2. Subject only to _paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7_ of this Attachment, the Completion Statement shall:

  

(A) be extracted from the books and records of the Company;

  

(B) reflect actual values at Completion (including by reference to the stock
take referred to in _paragraph 5_ below);

  

(C) exclude all Tax liabilities and deferred taxes other than VAT, payroll
taxes, construction industry tax, climate change levy or amounts in respect
thereof and all Tax assets or rights to repayments of Tax other than such Tax
assets or rights to repayments of Tax relating to VAT, payroll taxes,
construction industry tax, climate change levy or amounts in respect thereof;

  

(D) include a statement of the Completion Working Capital comprising the
following line items in the Accounts:

  

## (i) Stocks (including engineering spares) net of provision for stock
losses and obsolescence in respect of engineering spares; plus

  

## (ii) Debtors (and, for the avoidance of doubt, there will be no reserve
for doubtful or bad debts) including prepayments and other debtors; less

  

## (iii) Creditors due within one year, including accruals and any other
short term liabilities,

  

but excluding any amounts comprised in the following:

  

## (iv) the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount or the Intra-Group Balances;

  

## (v) the Final Cash Amount;

  

## (vi) any payables or accruals in respect of the LDPE Project;

  

## (vii) interest receivable and payable;

  

## (viii) dividends payable and receivable; or

     

   

## 

  

## (ix) US GAAP adjustments;

  

(E) include statements of the Final Cash Amount, the Final Third Party Debt
Amount and the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount;

  

(F) subject to _sub-paragraphs (B), (C), (D) and (E)_ and _paragraphs 3 to 7_
, be prepared on the same basis and in accordance with the same
principles, policies, procedures, methods and practices of accounting as were
applied for the purposes of the Accounts on the basis that the exercise of
judgment and discretion in the application of principles, policies,
procedures, methods and practices of accounting will be consistent with such
exercise as applied in relation to the Accounts and, for the avoidance of
doubt, this _sub-paragraph (F)_ shall not prevent changes in factual
circumstances (including, but not limited to, the Companys withdrawal from
the securitisation program relating to accounts receivable operated by the
Vendors Group) that have taken place between the Accounts Date and
Completion from being taken into account in the preparation of the Completion
Statement; and

  

(G) subject to _sub-paragraphs (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F)_ and _paragraphs 3
to 7_ , be prepared in accordance with principles, policies, procedures,
methods and practices of accounting generally accepted in the United Kingdom.

  

 _Sub-paragraphs (F) and (G)_ are intended to be applied as a hierarchy, with
_sub-paragraph (F)_ being applied first and with _sub-paragraph (G)_ being
applied only where ambiguity remains following application of _sub-paragraph
(F)_.

  

3. The Completion Statement shall be prepared on the basis that the Completion Statement relates to the Company as a going concern and excludes any effects of the change of control and ownership of the Company contemplated by this Agreement or any other effect of this Agreement.

  

4. All balances relevant for the calculation of the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount in the Completion Statement shall be reconciled to the extent practicable between the records of the payer and those of the payee; in the event of any discrepancy, the records of the payee, shall, unless otherwise agreed between the Purchaser and the Vendor, prevail.

  

5. For the purposes of the Completion Statement, the quantities used for the valuation of Stocks (including engineering spares) shall be based on a physical stock-take conducted on (or as soon as practicable after) the Completion Date, which both the Vendor and the Purchaser (or its accountants) will attend. 

  

6. In the preparation of the Completion Statement, where any monetary sum to be taken into account in calculating the Final Cash Amount, the Final Intra-Group Debt Amount, the Final Third Party Debt Amount or the Completion Working Capital is expressed in a currency other than US dollars, that amount shall be translated into US dollars at the closing rate of exchange on the third Business Day preceding the Completion Date as published by Bloomberg, or, where no such rate of exchange is published in respect of that date, at the rate quoted by Reuters as at close of business in the UK on that date.  For these purposes, what constitutes a "Business Day" will be determined by reference to days on which banks are open for

     

   



  

business in London (other than solely for trading and settlement in euros),
but not in New York or The Netherlands.

  

7. The Completion Statement shall reflect events which occur and information which becomes available after Completion to the extent that to do so is required by UK GAAP.
