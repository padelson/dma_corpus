shares has been determined by subtracting (i) the number of Escrow Shares from
(ii) Two Million (2,000,000), and the value of the Closing Shares shall be

be prepared and delivered, to the Buyer an estimated unaudited balance sheet
of the Company and the Subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, as of the end of

good faith estimate, calculated on a reasonable basis using the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Companys and the Subsidiarys books and records
and then available financial information, of the following amounts (the "
_Draft Computation_ "): (i) the Cash Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated
Cash Amount_ "), (ii) the Indebtedness Payoff Amount (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Indebtedness Payoff Amount_ "), (iii) the Net Working Capital
Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ ") and
(iv) the Unpaid Selling Expenses (such estimate, the " _Estimated Unpaid

with the preparation of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, but subject to the
methodology and procedures set forth in _Section 1.7(f)_ hereof.

3 1.6 Escrow Agreement. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit the Escrow
Shares with the Escrow Agent, who shall hold the Escrow Shares for up to a
period of twenty-four (24) months in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement, for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations
of the Company Shareholder set forth in this Agreement and for securing the
payment obligations of the Company Shareholder pursuant to _Section 1.7_. The
Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

1.7 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Company Shareholder shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Buyer an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, as
of the Closing Date but without giving effect to the Closing (the " _Draft
Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and a statement setting forth the Company
Shareholders determination of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Payoff
Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount and the Unpaid Selling Expenses (the "
_Closing Adjustment Statement_ " and together with the Draft Closing Balance
Sheet, the " _Closing Statements_ "). The Closing Statements shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the Most Recent Balance
Sheet and subject to the methodologies and procedures set forth in _Section
1.7(f)_ hereof. The Buyer shall cause the Company and its employees (i) to
assist the Company Shareholder in the preparation of the Closing Statements
and (ii) to provide the Company Shareholder and his representatives on-site
access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records
of the Company until final resolution of all matters in dispute (if any) under
this _Section 1.7_. 

(b) The Buyer shall deliver to the Company Shareholder, by the Objection
Deadline Date, either a notice indicating that the Buyer accepts the Closing
Statements or a detailed statement describing its objections (if any) to the
Closing Statements (the " _Statement of Objections_ "), which Statement of
Objections shall specify in reasonable detail the amount by which and the
reasons why the Buyer reasonably believes the Closing Statements either
contain errors or were not prepared in accordance with the methodology
specified in the second sentence of _Section 1.7(a)_ and _Section 1.7(f)_.
If the Buyer delivers to the Company Shareholder a notice accepting the
Closing Statements, or the Buyer does not deliver a Statement of Objections by
the Objection Deadline Date, then, effective as of the earlier of the date of
delivery of such notice of acceptance and the close of business on the
Objection Deadline Date, the Closing Statements shall be deemed to be the "
_Final Closing Statements_." If the Buyer timely objects to the Closing
Statements, such objections shall be resolved as follows:

(i) The Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall first use Reasonable Best
Efforts to resolve such objections. 

(ii) If the Buyer and the Company Shareholder do not reach a resolution of all
objections set forth on the Buyers Statement of Objections within 60 days
after delivery of such Statement of Objections, the Buyer and the Company
Shareholder shall, within 15 days following the expiration of such 60-day
period, engage the Accountant, pursuant to an engagement agreement
executed by the Buyer, the Company Shareholder and the Accountant, to resolve
any remaining objections set forth on the Buyers Statement of Objections (the
" _Unresolved Objections_ ").



 

4 (iii) The Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall jointly submit to the
Accountant, within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the Accountant
(as evidenced by the date of the engagement agreement), a copy of the Closing
Statements, a copy of the Statement of Objections delivered by the Buyer to
the Company Shareholder, and a statement setting forth the resolution of any
objections agreed to by the Buyer and the Company Shareholder. Each of the
Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall submit to the Accountant (with a copy
delivered to the other Party on the same day), within 45 days after the date
of the engagement of the Accountant, a memorandum (which may include
supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the
Unresolved Objections. Each of the Buyer and the Company Shareholder may (but
shall not be required to) submit to the Accountant (with a copy delivered to
the other Party on the same day), within 60 days after the date of the
engagement of the Accountant, a memorandum responding to the initial
memorandum submitted to the Accountant by the other Party. Unless requested
by the Accountant in writing, neither Party may present any additional
information or arguments to the Accountant, either orally or in writing.

(iv) Within 90 days after the date of its engagement hereunder, the Accountant
shall determine whether the objections raised by the Buyer are appropriate and
shall issue a ruling which shall include statements, consisting of the
Closing Statements as adjusted pursuant to any resolutions to objections
agreed upon by the Buyer and the Company Shareholder and pursuant to the
Accountants resolution of the Unresolved Objections. Such statements shall
be deemed to be the " _Final Closing Statements_."

(v) The resolution by the Accountant of the Unresolved Objections shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the Company Shareholder. The
Buyer and the Company Shareholder agree that the procedure set forth in this
_Section 1.7(b)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing
Statements shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; provided that this _Section 1.7(b)(v)_ shall not prohibit any Party
from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling of the Accountant.

(vi) The burden of proof with respect to any matter in dispute shall be on the
Buyer. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated by
the Accountant to each objection raised by the Buyer which is submitted to
the Accountant. The Buyer shall pay the Accountants fees and expenses for
each objection to the extent that each such objection was unsuccessful (as
finally determined by the Accountant) and the Company Shareholder shall pay
the balance of such fees and expenses.

(vii) The " _Actual Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to (i) Two
Hundred Five Million Dollars ($205,000,000), (ii) plus the Cash Amount, (iii)
minus the Indebtedness Payoff Amount, (iv) plus the excess of the Net Working
Capital Amount over the Target Net Working Capital Amount, if any, (v) minus
the excess of the Target Net Working Capital Amount over the Net Working
Capital Amount, if any, and (vi) minus the Unpaid Selling Expenses, in each
case as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_.



 

5 (c) If the Actual Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price
then within five Business Days after the final determination of the Actual
Purchase Price, the Buyer shall pay to the Company Shareholder, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company Shareholder, an amount equal to the amount by which the Actual
Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price plus simple
interest thereon, at an interest rate equal to 6%, from the Closing Date to
the date of payment, computed on an annual basis using a 360 day year.

 

(d) If the Actual Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then within five Business Days after the determination thereof, the Company
Shareholder shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the amount by which the
Actual Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price plus simple
interest on such amount at an interest rate equal to 6%, from the Closing Date
to the date of payment, computed on an annual basis using a 360 day year.

(e) In no event shall any adjustment amount payable pursuant to  _Section
1.7(c)_ or _Section 1.7(d)_ be subject to the Indemnity Cap, the General
Basket Amount or the IP Basket Amount. In no event shall any such adjustment

_Section 6.8(g)_ hereof, and shall not take a position inconsistent with such

6.8 Tax Matters.

(a) The Company Shareholder shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company and Subsidiary for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods subject to review and approval by the Buyer (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be
filed all other Tax Returns required for the Company. Any such Tax Returns
with respect to which the Buyer is responsible for preparing and filing
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall, insofar as they relate
to the Company, be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous such
returns filed in respect of the Company.

(b) The Company Shareholder shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction
or other tax items for Pre-Closing Tax Periods on his Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Schedule K-1s prepared by the Company for such periods.
The Company Shareholder shall pay on behalf of the Company any non-income
Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods including his share of Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Straddle Period Tax Return allocable to him as provided in
_Section 6.8(c)_.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax with respect to the
income, property or operations of the Company that are attributable to
any Straddle Period will be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period. The portion of such Tax
attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes,
withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or
profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the
denominator  



 

30  of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case
of any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes,
withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or
profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing
Date. The portion of Tax attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period shall
be calculated in a corresponding manner. The Buyer shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company
that are due and which include any Pre-Closing Straddle Period. At least 15
days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is filed, the Buyer shall
submit such Tax Return to the Company Shareholder for his review and approval.
On or before the date on which each such Tax Return that includes a Pre-
Closing Straddle Period is required to be filed, the Company Shareholder shall
pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes shown thereon that are allocable
to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period as provided under this  _Section 6.8(c)_
to the extent such amount is in excess of the reserve for Taxes shown on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that there is any dispute as to
the accuracy or completeness of any Tax Return or the amount of any Company
Shareholder obligation governed by this _Section 6.8_ (a " _Tax Dispute_ "),
the Buyer shall pay any Tax pursuant to such Tax Return as it becomes due and
the Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall resolve such Tax Dispute as
follows:

(i) The Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall first use Reasonable Best
Efforts to resolve such Tax Dispute. 

(ii) If the Buyer and the Company Shareholder do not reach a resolution of a
Tax Dispute within 30 days after delivery of the disputed Tax Return or
request for payment of tax obligations at issue, the Buyer and the Company
Shareholder shall, within 15 days following the expiration of such 30-day
period, engage the Accountant, pursuant to an engagement agreement executed by
the Buyer, the Company Shareholder and the Accountant, to resolve such Tax
Dispute.

(iii) The Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall jointly submit to the
Accountant, within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the Accountant
(as evidenced by the date of the engagement agreement), a copy of the Tax
Return at issue and a statement setting forth the resolution of any items of
the Tax Dispute agreed to by the Buyer and the Company Shareholder. Each of
the Buyer and the Company Shareholder shall submit to the Accountant (with a
copy delivered to the other Party on the same day), within 45 days after the
date of the engagement of the Accountant, a memorandum (which may include
supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the Tax
Dispute. Each of the Buyer and the Company Shareholder may (but shall not be
required to) submit to the Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other
Party on the same day), within 60 days after the date of the engagement of the
Accountant, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the
Accountant by the other Party. Unless requested by the Accountant in writing,
neither Party may present any additional information or arguments to the
Accountant, either orally or in writing.

(iv) Within 90 days after the date of its engagement hereunder, the
Accountant shall issue a ruling on the Tax Dispute.



 

31 (v) The resolution by the Accountant of the Tax Dispute shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Buyer and the Company Shareholder. The Buyer and the
Company Shareholder agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section
6.8(c)_ for resolving Tax Disputes shall be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving any such disputes; provided that this _Section 6.8(c)(v)_ shall
not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling of
the Accountant.

(vi) The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne equally by each
of the Buyer and the Company Shareholder.

(d) The Company Shareholder shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate
payment from the Company or the Buyer of, any Tax refund (including refunds
arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date) or
credit of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes (plus any interest thereon
received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority) relating
to the Company or the Subsidiary, for any Pre-Closing Period or a Pre-Closing
Straddle Period. The Buyer shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund or
credit of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes (plus any interest thereon
received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority) relating
to the Company or the Subsidiary, that were paid with respect to a period
after the Closing Date and to which the Company Shareholder is not otherwise
entitled under this _Section 6.8_. The Buyer and the Company Shareholder
shall cooperate with respect to claiming any refund referred to in this 
_Section 6.8(d)_, including notifying the Company Shareholder or the Buyer,
as the case may be, of the existence of any facts that would constitute a
reasonable basis for claiming such a refund, providing all relevant
information available to the Company Shareholder or the Buyer (through the
Company or otherwise), as the case may be, with respect to any such claim,
filing and diligently pursuing such claim (including by litigation, if
appropriate), and, in the case of the Party filing such a claim, consulting
with the other applicable Party prior to agreeing to any disposition of such
claim.

(e) The Buyer shall not permit the Company to amend a Tax Return with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period nor take any action that might have an adverse
effect upon the Tax liability of the Company or the Company Shareholder with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

(f) All transfer, sales, use and similar Taxes arising out of the sale of the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid (or cause to be paid) by the
Buyer.

(g) The Company, the Company Shareholder and the Buyer shall join in making an
election under Code §338(h)(10) (and any corresponding state, local and
foreign tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of Company stock
hereunder (collectively, a " _§ 338(h)(10) Election_"). If the §338(h)(10)
Election is made, Buyer and the Company Shareholder agree to allocate the
Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiary (and all
other relevant items) to the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary in
accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Buyer and the
Company Shareholder agree to cooperate to prepare and file IRS Form 8883 and
all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such Purchase Price Allocation.
The Company and the Company Shareholder shall include any income, gain, loss,
deduction or other tax item resulting from the §338(h)(10) Election on their
Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable law. The Company and the
Company Shareholder shall also pay any Tax imposed on Company or the  



 

32  Subsidiary attributable to the making of the §338(h)(10) Election, including
(i) any Tax imposed under Code §1374 or (ii) any state, local or foreign Tax
imposed on the Companys or the Subsidiarys gain, and the Company and the
Company Shareholder shall indemnify Buyer against any adverse consequences
arising out of any failure to pay any such taxes.

(h) The Company shall not revoke its election to be taxed as an S corporation
within the meaning of Code §1361 and §1362\. The Company shall not take or
allow any action other than the sale of the Companys stock pursuant to this
Agreement that would result in the termination of the Companys status as a
validly electing S corporation within the meaning of Code §1361 and §1362\.
The Subsidiary shall not revoke its election to be taxed as a qualified
subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Code §1361 and §1362\. The

subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Code §1361 and §1362\.

(i) The Buyer shall reimburse the Company Shareholder promptly in immediately
available funds the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount of
Built-in Gains Tax included in the Net Working Capital Amount over the actual
amount of Built-in Gains Tax relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement payable by the Company following the Closing.

6.9 Access to Information.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company will give the
Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and
records of the Company; provided, that any such access (i) shall be during
normal business hours on reasonable notice, (ii) shall not, except as
otherwise agreed in writing by the Company Shareholder and the Company,
include any sampling or testing of soil, sediment, surface or ground water

be prohibited or otherwise limited by any applicable Law or agreement and
(iii) shall not otherwise unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, in connection with any matter relating to
any period prior to, or any period ending on, the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Company Shareholder,
permit the Company Shareholder and his representatives full access at all
reasonable times to the books and records of the Company, and the Buyer shall
execute (and shall cause the Company to execute) such documents as the
Company Shareholder may reasonably request to enable the Company Shareholder
to defend Tax audits, perform Tax planning or file any required reports or Tax
Returns relating to the Company. The Buyer shall not dispose of such books
and records during the seven-year period beginning with the Closing Date
without the Company Shareholders written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Following the expiration of
such seven-year period, the Buyer may dispose of such books and records at any
time upon giving 60 days prior written notice to the Company Shareholder,
unless the Company Shareholder agrees to take possession of such books
and records within 60 days at no expense to the Buyer.

6.10 Director and Officer Liability, Indemnification and Insurance. For a
period of six years after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not, and shall
not permit the Company or the  



 

33  Subsidiary to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent documents) relating to the exculpation
or indemnification of any current or former officer, manager, director or
similar functionary, it being the intent of the Parties that the officers,
managers, directors and similar functionaries of the Company and the
Subsidiary shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent of the law. The Company Shareholder may,
but shall not be required to, maintain or purchase, at the Company
Shareholders expense, officers and directors liability insurance, or other
liability insurance that covers events occurring prior to the Closing on such
terms and in such amounts as the Company Shareholder shall determine. The
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate with the Company
Shareholder and provide such reasonable assistance, not including any
obligation to pay any part of any premium, as is reasonably requested by the
Company Shareholder in connection with the maintenance and purchase of such
insurance. If the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Subsidiary shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former officer,
director or similar functionary of the Company and the Subsidiary and his or
her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have had by contract or otherwise.

applicable Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) 



 

34  through the end of Buyers current fiscal year, provide each such Company

deductible or out-of-pocket requirements (except to the extent prohibited by
the terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plan); and (iii) recognize all
continuous service of the Company Employees with the Company, as applicable,
for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate,

such Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing
(except to the extent prohibited by the terms of the applicable
Employee Benefit Plan and provided that the Company sponsored or maintained a
similar plan prior to the Closing); provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. In no event
shall the provisions of this  _Section 6.11_ in any way limit the Buyers
ability to transition Company Employees from Company Plans to Employee Benefit
Plans of the Buyer following the Closing.

(d) No provision of this _Section 6.11_ shall (i) create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, the Subsidiary, or any other
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, (ii) constitute or create an employment agreement or (iii)

conjunction with another Person, shall hire or solicit any Person who is an
employee, consultant or agent of the Company or the  



 

35  Subsidiary within six (6) months of the Closing Date to terminate his
employment or consulting arrangement with the Buyer (or the Company or
the Subsidiary) or to become an employee of the Company Shareholder or any of
his Affiliates; provided, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Company
Shareholder or any of his Affiliates from hiring or soliciting any such Person
whose employment is terminated by the Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiary
(or any other Affiliate of the Buyer) at any time following the Closing Date.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 6.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, from
and for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, neither the Company
Shareholder nor any of his Affiliates shall, whether individually or in
conjunction with another Person, except as an officer or employee of the
Buyer or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, directly or

or acceptance of business from, any of the customers of the Company or the
Subsidiary. In the event the Company Shareholder is contacted by any such
customer during such five-year period in connection with any product or
service prohibited in this _Section 6.14_, he will refer such customer to the
Buyer. In addition, the Company Shareholder agrees that he will not disparage
or make fraudulent statements to another Person or otherwise with respect to
the services, business or reputation of the Buyer or Parent whether by making
false or misleading statements to another Person or otherwise.

(d) The Parties agree that the duration and geographic scope of the non-
competition provision set forth in _Section 6.14_ are reasonable. In the
event that any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the duration or
the geographic scope, or both, are unreasonable and that such provision is to
that extent unenforceable, the Parties agree that the provision shall remain

area that would not render it unenforceable.

aggregate value (as determined pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) equal to the

Tax benefit after an indemnification payment has been made, the Buyer shall
promptly pay to the Company Shareholder the amount of such Tax benefit at such
time or times and to the extent that such Tax benefit is realized. In the
event that an insurance recovery is made by the Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates with respect to any Damages for which any such
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate
amount of such recovery (net of all attorneys fees, expenses and other costs
of recovery) shall be made promptly to the Company Shareholder.

properties, including, where available, risk-based cleanup standards to

unreasonably interfere with the Buyers operation of the Companys business.
The Company and the Buyer shall provide the Company Shareholder with (a) the
right to receive and comment on copies of all environmental and engineering
studies and data prepared by the Company or the Buyer or their agents, and (b)

and the Buyer shall also provide the Company Shareholder with (i) a reasonable
opportunity to attend any site visits or meetings with Governmental Entities;
(ii) copies of material correspondence and reports; (iii) a reasonable
opportunity to comment in advance on any draft scope of work, specifications,
proposals, statements, reports or other material documents or correspondence;
and (iv) an opportunity to attend and observe any such investigation or
remediation, including obtaining split samples.

(k) The Company Shareholder shall be entitled to continue to control the
defense of the Aztec Litigation, at the Companys expense until the expenses
exceed the reserve for the Aztec Litigation included in the balance sheet used
to calculate the Actual Purchase Price in accordance with  _Section 1.7_,
and thereafter it is at the Company Shareholders expense; provided, however,
that the Company Shareholder shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from the Aztec Litigation without the Buyers
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. In addition, in determining the amount of Damages for which the
Company Shareholder may be obligated to indemnify the Buyer under  _Section
8.1(f)_, if any judgment or settlement of the Aztec Litigation requires the
Company to provide product to Aztec, the Buyers Damages related to the
provision of such product shall be limited to the Companys actual cost for
such products (and will not include any lost profit or gross margin) plus any
out of pocket expenses of the Company directly related to such judgment or
settlement (including reasonable legal expenses).



 

49 (l) After the Closing, except for claims relating to fraud, intentional
misrepresentations, criminal activity, or claims relating to a breach of the
covenants set forth in _Section 6.14_ or as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Article VIII_
shall be the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to
claims under this Agreement, whether resulting from or relating to any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or
otherwise. The burden of establishing intentional misrepresentations is on the
Buyer.

8.6 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any amount paid by the Company

or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified.

of any state or federal court sitting in Connecticut in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any action
