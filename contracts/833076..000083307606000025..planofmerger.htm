RECITALS

 



 

The  parties intend that, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth,  Merger Sub merge with and into JJI in a statutory merger (the
"Merger"), with  JJI to be the surviving corporation, all pursuant to the
terms and conditions  of  this Agreement and a Certificate of Merger
substantially in the form of  ** _Exhibit  A_**   with any  blanks to be
completed as agreed by JJI and Merger Sub (the "Certificate of  Merger") and
the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the  State of
Delaware ("DGCL"). Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, (i) all  outstanding
capital stock of JJI ("JJI Stock") shall be cancelled, and each  outstanding
Class B Common Stock Warrant shall be cancelled, in exchange for  the  right
to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, as provided in this 
Agreement and the Certificate of Merger and (ii) there will not be
outstanding  any rights to acquire or equity claims regarding any JJI Stock
or Class B Common  Stock Warrants, or other equity rights or rights to
acquire equity.

 



 

The  Merger is intended to be a taxable transaction pursuant to the
provisions of  the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and the parties intend  to treat the transaction as a taxable purchase of the
JJI Stock and Class B  Common Stock Warrants.

 



 

The  Board  of Directors of JJI (i) has determined that the Merger is
consistent with and  in  furtherance of the long-term business strategy of
JJI and advisable and fair  to,  and in the best interests of JJI and its
stockholders, (ii) has approved this  Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions and (iii) has determined to  recommend that the Stockholders of
JJI adopt and approve this Agreement and  approve the Merger.

 



 

The  holders of 87% of the JJI Stock have agreed to vote in favor of or
consent  in a  binding manner to the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.

 



 

The  Board  of Directors and the sole shareholder of Merger Sub has approved
the Merger  and  related Transactions and authorized certain officers to
take any and all actions  on behalf of the Merger Sub that any such
authorized officer deems necessary  in  connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 



 

The  Board  of Directors of Parent has approved the Merger and related
Transactions and  authorized certain officers to take any and all actions on
behalf of the Parent  that any such authorized officer deems necessary in
connection with the Merger  and the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

covenants  and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as 
follows:

 



 

ARTICLE  I

 

MERGER

 



 

1.1  _The  Merger_.  At the  Effective Time, and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this  Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL,
Merger Sub shall be merged with  and  into JJI, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and JJI  shall continue as the surviving
corporation, being the successor to all the  property, rights, powers,
privileges, liabilities, and obligations of both  JJI  and Merger Sub. JJI
as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter  referred to as
JJI or the "Surviving Company."

 



 

1.2  _The  Closing_.  The  closing of the Merger (the "Closing") __
shall  take place at a time and on a date (i) specified by the parties, which
shall  be  no later than five (5) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver
of each of  the  conditions set forth in Article V or (ii) agreed to in
writing by JJI and Parent  (the "Closing Date"). The Closing will be held at
the offices of Stoll Keenon  Ogden PLLC, at 1700 PNC Plaza, 500 West
Jefferson Street, Louisville, KY 40202,  unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

1.3  _Effective  Time_.  Simultaneous with the Closing, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to  be  consummated by filing a Certificate of
Merger, executed in accordance with  the  relevant provisions of the DGCL,
with the Delaware Secretary of State (the  time  of such filing being the
"Effective Time").

 



 

1.4  _Conversion  of Merger Sub Stock and JJI Stock and Class B Common
Stock  Warrants_.

 



 

1.4.1  _Merger  Sub Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger, (i) each share of common stock of  Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be  converted into and become Eleven
Thousand (11,000) shares of common stock of  the  Surviving Company of the
Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and  privileges as the shares
so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding  shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Company and (ii) no Person other than  the
shareholder(s) of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time 
shall have any ownership of any capital stock, or any right to thereafter 
acquire any ownership of any capital stock, of JJI.

 

 

1.4.2  _Treasury  Shares_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part  of  any Person each share of
capital stock of JJI then held in the treasury of  JJI  or owned by JJI
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without  payment of
any consideration therefor.

 



 

1.4.3  _JJI  Stock and Warrants_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part  of  any Person, each share of
JJI Stock outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time and each Class
B Common Stock Warrant outstanding  immediately

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

prior  to  the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired, in exchange for
the right  to  receive either (i) (A) a portion (determined as set forth on
the "Net Merger  Consideration Payable at the Effective Time" column of
**_Exhibit  B_** )  of the  Net Merger Consideration and (B) possibly a
portion of the Escrow Fund Amount  (determined as set forth in Sections 1.8
and 1.9), but only to the extent  expressly provided in this Agreement
(collectively such rights are the "Merger  Consideration Rights") or (ii)
only with respect to JJI Stock, the right to  receive consideration in
connection with perfected appraisal rights in  accordance with Section 1.4.5.

 



 

1.4.4  _Funding  of Escrow Agreement_.  On the  Effective Date (or such
later time as may be approved by the Stockholders' Agent) and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section  1.4, the Escrow Fund
Amount shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration  in  accordance with
Section 1.7 and the Escrow Fund Amount shall be paid to the  Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of Section 1.7.2.1 of this Agreement  and the
Escrow Agreement (the difference between (i) the Merger Consideration  as 
of the Effective Time and (ii) the sum of the Escrow Fund Amount and the 
Appraisal Right Stockholders' Consideration, if any, is the "Net Merger 
Consideration").

 

 

1.4.5  _Appraisal  Rights_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any issued and  outstanding shares of JJI Stock held by a
person who has neither voted in favor  of the Merger nor consented in writing
thereto and who otherwise complies with  all the applicable provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL concerning the rights  of holders of shares of JJI
Stock to dissent from the Merger and require  appraisal of their shares of
JJI Stock (the "Dissenting Stockholder") shall not  be converted into or
exchangeable for the right to receive any portion of the  Merger
Consideration or any other amount pursuant to this Agreement, but shall 
become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due  to  such Dissenting Stockholder with respect to shares for which
appraisal rights  have been perfected pursuant to the laws of the State of
Delaware. Shares of  JJI  Stock with respect to which appraisal rights have
been perfected are referred  to  as "Dissenting Shares". The Dissenting
Shares held by each Dissenting  Stockholder that withdraws his, her or its
demand for appraisal or fails to  perfect or otherwise loses his, her or its
right of appraisal, in any case  pursuant to the DGCL, shall no longer be
considered Dissenting Shares and shall  be deemed to be canceled as of the
Effective Time in exchange for the right  to  receive the same portion of
the Merger Consideration Rights that he, she or  it  would have received as
set forth in this Section 1.4. The remaining Dissenting  Stockholders shall
be referred to as the "Appraisal Rights Stockholders". JJI  or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall give the Parent  (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of JJI Stock  received by JJI
or the Surviving Company, as applicable, and (ii) the  opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect  to  any such
demands. JJI shall not, without the prior consent of Parent, make  any 
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, 
any  such demands. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i)  the Appraisal Rights Stockholders will not be entitled to any
portion of the  Merger Consideration or any payment pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) any  amounts from the Merger Consideration and the Escrow
Fund Amount which would  have been paid to Appraisal Rights Stockholders had
such Appraisal Rights  Stockholders not

become  Appraisal Rights Stockholders shall be paid to and be the sole
property of  the  Surviving Company and neither the Stockholders nor any
other Person shall have  any right thereto.

appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for  the purpose of exchanging the
Merger Consideration for certificates representing  shares of JJI Stock and
for agreements representing Class B Common Stock  Warrants (collectively, the
"Certificates"). Parent has the right at any time in  its sole discretion to
replace the Exchange Agent with another agent, including  itself or one of
its Affiliates, for the purpose of exchanging Merger  Consideration for
Certificates.

 

 

1.4.6.2  _Deposit  of Merger Consideration with Exchange Agent_.  Parent 
or the Surviving Company shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as
needed  and at the time required by this Agreement, cash sufficient to fund
the portion  of the Merger Consideration to be paid by the Exchange Agent in
respect of  the  Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

1.4.6.3  _Letter  of Transmittal_.  At or  prior to the Closing, JJI shall
provide Parent with a list showing, for each  Stockholder, the address of
each such Stockholder, holdings of JJI Stock and  Class B Common Stock
Warrants by each such Stockholder, the percentage of the  Merger
Consideration applicable to each such Stockholder and such other  information
as Parent may reasonably request. As soon as reasonably practicable 
following the Closing, the Exchange Agent or Parent shall provide to each 
Stockholder (at the address provided by JJI pursuant to this Section
1.4.6.3)  a  letter of transmittal (in form attached hereto as **_Exhibit 
C_**   ("Letter  of Transmittal")) and instructions for use in such
exchange. If Parent desires  to modify the Letter of Transmittal, then Parent
may send Stockholders' Agent  written notice of Parent's proposed
modifications and Stockholders' Agent shall  have five (5) Business Days
after such notice has been received by Stockholders' Agent in which to object
to the notice. If no such objection is received by  Parent during such five
(5) Business Days, Parent shall have the right to modify  the Letter of
Transmittal as indicated in the written notice Parent sent  Stockholders'
Agent. Provided further, Parent shall, at any time, with or  without
complying with the immediately preceding two sentences, have the right  to
modify the Letter of Transmittal with the prior written consent of 
Stockholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed.

 

 

1.4.6.4  _Surrender  of Certificates_.  Subject  to Sections 1.4.5 and

entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a  Certificate
(negotiated as provided in the instructions from the Exchange Agent  or
Parent), together with the properly completed and duly executed (by the 
holder) Letter of Transmittal, payment(s) (determined in accordance with
this  Agreement) in respect of such holder's Merger Consideration Rights in

Consideration Rights  pursuant and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement upon proper presentment  of the Certificate and the Letter of
Transmittal. No interest shall be paid  or  accrue on any Merger
Consideration except to the extent otherwise expressly  provided in the
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement  to  the
contrary, no holder of Merger Consideration Rights shall be entitled to 
any  payment(s) of the Merger Consideration (including post-closing payments,
if  any  from the Escrow Fund Amount) with respect to any Merger
Consideration Rights  for  which Certificate(s) and Letters of Transmittal
have not been properly executed  and presented in accordance with this
Section 1.4.6.4 or for which the  requirements of 1.4.6.10 have not been
complied with relating to lost, stolen  or  destroyed Certificates.

tax has been paid  or is  not payable.

Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of  JJI  Stock or

Stock Warrants presents to the Exchange Agent(s) such holder's

Agent or Parent) therefor along with the Letter(s) of Transmittal duly
completed  and executed by such holder and effects the surrender of such
Certificate(s)  (all in compliance with Sections 1.4.6.3 and 1.4.6.4), then

Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent  pursuant to this Section
1.4.6 that remains unclaimed by the holders of  Merger Consideration Rights
thirty (30) days after the Effective Time shall  be  returned to the
Surviving Company, upon demand by the Parent. Any such holder  who has not
exchanged his, her or its Merger Consideration Rights for his,  her  or its

prior to such return of unclaimed Merger Consideration shall  (i) be subject
to the provisions of Sections 1.8.7 and 1.9.4.4 and the  provisions of the

Consideration he, she or it may be entitled to receive, if any, in respect 
of  such Merger Consideration Rights (without any interest thereon and
reduced  for  any amounts required to be withheld under the Code with
respect to the making  of  such payment). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement  to the contrary, neither Parent, nor any
Affiliate of Parent, nor the Surviving  Company nor any Exchange Agent shall

the Merger Consideration paid to a  public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar  laws.

Fund") as directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any interest and  other income
resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent. In the  event there
are any losses resulting from such investments or wrongful conduct  on the
part of such Exchange Agent such that the cash in the Exchange Fund  shall 
be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made 
by  such Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly cause cash to be

1.7.1.4.4  _Adjustment  of Merger Consideration_.  At the  Closing, the
parties shall calculate an amount equal to (i) the Estimated  Working Capital
minus (ii) the Target Working Capital (the "Closing Working  Capital
Adjustment Amount"). If the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount is 
positive, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased by the Closing 
Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Closing Working Capital

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Adjustment  Amount is negative, then the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by the  Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

1.8.1  THIS SECTION INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.

 



 

1.8.2  _Indemnity  Escrow Amount Following General Survival Period_.  In 
order to avoid holding unnecessary funds in escrow, the Parent and the 
Stockholders' Agent have agreed that after the General Survival Period, the 
Indemnity Escrow Amount need not be greater than the lesser of (x) the
Adjusted  Indemnity Escrow Amount at the expiration of the General Survival
Period and  (y)  the sum of (i) Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)
plus (ii) One Million  One Hundred Ninety-Seven Thousand Dollars ($1,197,000)
plus (iii) the Estimated  Unresolved Claims Amount (as defined in Section
1.8.2.2 but determined in  accordance with Sections 1.8.2.1, 1.8.2.2 or
1.8.2.3, as applicable)  (collectively, the "Continuing Indemnity Escrow").

 



 

1.8.2.1  _Estimated  Unresolved Claims Amount Equals Zero_.  If the 
Escrow Agent and Stockholders' Agent have not been sent notice (as referenced
in  Section 7.1) of one or more Parent Claims prior to the termination of
the  General Survival Period or if a Parent Indemnified Party has provided
one or  more of such notices and such Parent Claims have been fully resolved
and paid  to  the satisfaction of the applicable Parent Indemnified Party,
then (i) the  Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount shall be deemed to equal
zero and (ii) the  Continuing Indemnity Escrow shall be deemed to equal One
Million Six Hundred  Ninety-Seven Thousand Dollars ($1,697,000). If  the 
Continuing Indemnity Escrow is less than the Adjusted Indemnity

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Escrow  Amount, then the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall promptly
provide joint  written directions to the Escrow Agent to disburse (and the
intended recipients  shall be entitled to demand from the Escrow Agent and
receive) such difference  between the Continuing Indemnity Escrow and the
Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount  in accordance with the Agreed Escrow
Distribution Methodology.  If the  Continuing Indemnity Escrow is more than
the Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount,  there shall be no disbursements from
the Indemnity Escrow Amount at that  time.

 



 

1.8.2.2  _Determining  Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount During Resolution
Period_.  If the  Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount has not been deemed to
equal zero pursuant  to  Section 1.8.2.1, then the aggregate amount of the
past, present and estimated  future Adverse Consequences from each and every
Parent Claim that has not been  fully resolved and paid to the satisfaction
of the applicable Parent Indemnified  Party from the Indemnity Escrow Amount
prior to the end of the General Survival  Period (each a "Surviving Claim")
shall be aggregated (the "Estimated Unresolved  Claims Amount"). The Parent
and the Stockholders' Agent shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to
resolve any Surviving Claims in a reasonable time period.  The Stockholders'
Agent and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts, for  a period of up
to thirty (30) days (or such longer period as to which they  shall  mutually
agree) (the "Resolution Period") following the termination of the  General
Survival Period, to agree on an amount for the Estimated Unresolved  Claims
Amount which shall be an amount sufficient to pay all past, present  and 
estimated future Adverse Consequences relating to all Surviving Claims. If 
three  (3) Business Days remain prior to the termination of the Resolution
Period  and  the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent have failed to agree on
the amount of the  Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount, then Parent or Parent
Indemnified Party  shall provide written notice of its Parent Demand Amount
to Stockholders' Agent  on or before two (2) Business Days prior to the
termination of the Resolution  Period. If the Parent and the Stockholders'
Agent agree on the amount of the  Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount during
such Resolution Period, then the  Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall
calculate the amount of the Continuing  Indemnity Escrow. Otherwise, the
Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall follow  the procedures set forth in
Section 1.8.2.3. If the Continuing Indemnity Escrow  is less than the
Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount, then the Parent and the  Stockholders'
Agent shall promptly provide joint written directions to the  Escrow Agent to
disburse (and the intended recipients shall be entitled to  demand from the
Escrow Agent and receive) such difference between the Continuing  Indemnity
Escrow and the Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with  the 
Agreed Escrow Distribution Methodology. If the Continuing Indemnity Escrow 
is  more than the Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount, there shall be no
disbursements  from the Indemnity Escrow Amount at that time.

 



 

1.8.2.3  _Accountant  Determination of Estimated Unresolved Claims
Amount_.  If the  Parent and the Stockholders' Agent fail to agree on the
Estimated Unresolved  Claims Amount prior to the termination of the
Resolution Period, then the amount  of the Continuing Indemnity Escrow shall
be tentatively calculated based on  an  assumption that the Estimated
Unresolved Claims Amount is equal to the Parent  Demand Amount. If such
tentatively calculated Continuing Indemnity Escrow is  less than the Adjusted
Indemnity Escrow

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Amount,  then the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall promptly provide
joint written  directions to the Escrow Agent to disburse (and the intended
recipients shall  be  entitled to demand from the Escrow Agent and receive)
such difference between  the tentatively calculated Continuing Indemnity
Escrow and the Adjusted  Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the
Agreed Escrow Distribution  Methodology. If the Continuing Indemnity Escrow
is more than the Adjusted  Indemnity Escrow Amount, there shall be no
disbursements from the Indemnity  Escrow Amount at that time.

 



 

The  Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall thereafter promptly submit
the  estimation of the Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount to the Accounting
Firm  for  final resolution based on the Accounting Firm's estimate of the
amount which  will be sufficient to pay all past and present and estimated
future Adverse  Consequences relating to all Surviving Claims. The fees and
expenses of the  Accounting Firm in connection with its duties under this
Section 1.8 shall  be  paid one-half (1/2) by Parent and one-half (1/2) from
the Estimated Unresolved  Claims Amount and the amount to be paid from the
Estimated Unresolved Claims  Amount shall also be considered a Surviving
Claim and referred to hereafter  as  the "Accountant Surviving Claim." The
amount for the Estimated Unresolved Claims  Amount shall be increased by the
Accountant Surviving Claim. Once the Accounting  Firm has estimated the
Estimated Unresolved Claims Amount, then the Parent  and  the Stockholders'
Agent shall calculate an amount equal to (i) the Parent Demand  Amount minus
(ii) the Accounting Firm's estimate of the Estimated Unresolved  Claims
Amount (the "Adjustment Amount"). If the Adjustment Amount is positive,  then
the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall promptly provide joint written 
directions to the Escrow Agent to disburse (and the intended recipients
shall  be  entitled to demand from the Escrow Agent and receive) the
Adjustment Amount  in  accordance with the Agreed Escrow Distribution
Methodology. If the Adjustment  Amount is negative, there shall be no
additional disbursements from the  Indemnity Escrow Amount at that time.

 



 

1.8.3  _Stockholders  Shall Not Contribute Additional Funds Following
General Survival  Period_.  The  Stockholders shall not be obligated to
contribute additional funds upon  termination of the General Survival Period
to increase the amount of the  Indemnity Escrow Amount in the event the
amount of the Continuing Indemnity  Escrow is greater than the Adjusted
Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided,  however_ ,  while  the Stockholders
are not obligated to increase the Indemnity Escrow Amount,  the  provisions
of this sentence shall not impair the right or access of any Parent 
Indemnified Party to any other remedy, including specific performance and 
damages, against any one or more Stockholders in connection with any Parent 
Limitation Exceptions.

 



 

1.8.4  _Indemnity  Escrow Amount Following Tax_ _and  German Environmental
Issue_ _Survival  Period_.  In  order to avoid holding unnecessary funds in
escrow, the Parent and the  Stockholders' Agent have agreed that after the
Tax and  German Environmental Issue Survival  Period, the Indemnity Escrow
Amount need not be greater than the Final  Continuing Indemnity Escrow (as
defined in Section 1.8.4.2 but determined in  accordance with Sections
1.8.4.1, 1.8.4.2 or 1.8.4.3, as appropriate). 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

1.8.4.1  _Final  Continuing Indemnity Escrow Equals Zero_.  If the  Escrow
Agent and Stockholders' Agent have not been sent notice (as referenced in 
Section 7.1) of one or more Parent Claims from the Effective Time through
the  termination of the Tax and German Environmental Issue Survival Period,
or if  a  Parent Indemnified Party has provided one or more of such notices
and such  Parent Claims have been fully resolved and paid to the satisfaction
of the  applicable Parent Indemnified Party, then the Final Continuing
Indemnity Escrow  shall be deemed to equal zero. The Parent and the
Stockholders' Agent shall  promptly provide joint written directions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse (and  the intended recipients shall be entitled to
demand from the Escrow Agent and  receive) the remaining Adjusted Indemnity
Escrow Amount in accordance with  the  Agreed Escrow Distribution
Methodology.

 



 

1.8.4.2  _Determining  Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow During Resolution
Period_.  If the  Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow has not been deemed to
equal zero pursuant  to  Section 1.8.4.1, then the aggregate amount of the
past, present and estimated  future Adverse Consequences from each and every
timely asserted Parent Claim  (including each and every unpaid Surviving
Claim) that has not been fully  resolved and paid to the satisfaction of the
applicable Parent Indemnified  Party  from the Indemnity Escrow Amount prior
to the end of the Tax and German  Environmental Issue Survival Period (each a
"Continuing Surviving Claim") shall  be aggregated (the "Final Continuing
Indemnity Escrow"). The Parent and the  Stockholders' Agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any  Continuing Surviving Claims
in a reasonable time period. The Stockholders' Agent  and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts during the Resolution Period  following the
termination of the Tax and German Environmental Survival Period,  to agree on
an amount for the Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow which shall  be  an
amount sufficient to pay all past, present and estimated future Adverse 
Consequences relating to all Continuing Surviving Claims. If three (3)
Business  Days remain prior to the termination of such Resolution Period and
the Parent  and the Stockholders' Agent have failed to agree on the amount of
the Final  Continuing Indemnity Escrow, then Parent or Parent Indemnified
Party shall  provide written notice of its Parent Demand Amount to
Stockholders' Agent on or  before two (2) Business Days prior to the
termination of such Resolution Period.  If the Parent and the Stockholders'
Agent fail to agree on the Final Continuing  Indemnity Escrow during such
Resolution Period, then the Parent and the  Stockholders' Agent shall follow
the procedures set forth in Section 1.8.4.3.  Otherwise, if the Final
Continuing Indemnity Escrow is less than the Adjusted  Indemnity Escrow
Amount, the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall promptly  provide joint
written directions to the Escrow Agent to disburse (and the  intended
recipients shall be entitled to demand from the Escrow Agent and  receive)
such difference between the Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow and  the 
Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the Agreed Escrow 
Distribution Methodology. If the Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow is more 
than  the Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount, there shall be no disbursements
from  the  Indemnity Escrow Amount at that time.

 



 

1.8.4.3  _Accountant  Determination of Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow_. 
If the  Parent and the Stockholders' Agent fail to agree on the Final
Continuing  Indemnity Escrow prior to the termination of the Resolution
Period following  the  termination of the Tax

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

and  German Environmental Survival Period, then the Final Continuing
Indemnity Escrow  shall be tentatively assumed to be equal to the Parent
Demand Amount. If such  tentatively assumed Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow
is less than the Adjusted  Indemnity Escrow Amount, then the Parent and the
Stockholders' Agent shall  promptly provide joint written directions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse (and  the intended recipients shall be entitled to
demand from the Escrow Agent and  receive) such difference between the
tentatively assumed Final Continuing  Indemnity Escrow and the Adjusted
Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with  the  Agreed Escrow Distribution
Methodology. If the tentatively assumed Final  Continuing Indemnity Escrow is
more than the Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount,  there shall be no
disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Amount at that time. 

 



 

The  Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall thereafter promptly submit
the  estimation of the Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow to the Accounting
Firm  for  final resolution based on the Accounting Firm's estimate of the
amount which  will be sufficient to pay all past and present and estimated
future Adverse  Consequences relating to all Continuing Surviving Claims. The
fees and expenses  of the Accounting Firm in connection with its duties under
this Section 1.8  shall be paid one-half (1/2) by Parent and one-half (1/2)
from the Final  Continuing Indemnity Escrow and the amount to be paid from
the Final Continuing  Indemnity Escrow shall also be considered a Continuing
Surviving Claim and  referred to hereafter as the "Accountant Continuing
Surviving Claim." Thus, the  amount for the Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow
shall be increased by the  Accountant Continuing Surviving Claim. Once the
Accounting Firm has estimated  the Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow, then
the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall calculate an amount equal to (i)
the Parent Demand Amount minus  (ii)  the Accounting Firm's estimate of the
Final Continuing Indemnity Escrow (the "Final Adjustment Amount"). If the
Final Adjustment Amount is positive, then the  Parent and the Stockholders'
Agent shall promptly provide joint written  directions to the Escrow Agent to
disburse (and the intended recipients shall  be  entitled to demand from the
Escrow Agent and receive) the Final Adjustment  Amount in accordance with the
Agreed Escrow Distribution Methodology. If the  Final Adjustment Amount is
negative, there shall be no additional disbursements  from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount at that time.

 



 

1.8.5  _Stockholders  Shall Not Contribute Additional Funds Following Tax
and German Environmental  Survival Period_.  The  Stockholders shall not be
obligated to contribute additional funds upon  termination of the Tax and
German Environmental Survival Period to increase  the  amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount in the event the amount of the Final  Continuing
Indemnity Escrow is greater than the Adjusted Indemnity Escrow  Amount;
_provided,  however_ ,  while  the Stockholders are not obligated to
increase the Indemnity Escrow Amount,  the  provisions of this sentence
shall not impair the right or access of any Parent  Indemnified Party to any
other remedy, including specific performance and  damages, against any one or
more Stockholders in connection with any Parent  Limitation Exceptions.

 

 

1.8.6  _Final  Release from Indemnity Escrow Amount_.  Following the
resolution of all Continuing Surviving Claims and payments from  the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow 
Agreement) of Adverse Consequences suffered

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

through  the final resolution of all Continuing Surviving Claims by the
applicable Parent  Indemnified Party for which such Parent Indemnified Party
is then entitled  to  indemnification, the Parent and the Stockholders'
Agent shall promptly provide  joint written directions to the Escrow Agent to
disburse (and the intended  recipient shall be entitled to demand from the
Escrow Agent and receive) the  remaining Adjusted Indemnity Escrow Amount in
accordance with the Agreed Escrow  Distribution Methodology.

 



 

1.8.7  _Payments  to Non-Claiming Holders_. 

 



 

1.8.7.1  If a Non-Claiming Holder duly surrenders his, her or its duly
negotiated  Certificate(s) and duly tenders his, her or its duly executed
Letter(s) of  Transmittal (with such modifications, if any, made in
accordance with Section  1.4.6.3) in accordance with Section 1.4.6 following
the Parent's receipt of any  disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Amount
made in accordance with the  Agreed Distribution Methodology, then the
Surviving Company will cause to be  paid to any such Non-Claiming Holder
(subject to Sections 1.4.6.8 and 1.8.7.2)  an amount equal to the amount
(without interest and reduced for any amounts  required to be withheld under
the Code with respect to the making of such  payment) such Non-Claiming
Holder would have otherwise received but did not  receive as a result of
being a Non-Claiming Holder.

 



 

1.8.7.2  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.8.7.1 or any other
provision of  this  Agreement, neither Parent, nor any Affiliate of Parent,
nor the Surviving  Company shall be liable to any Non-Claiming Holder for any
disbursements Parent  received from the Indemnity Escrow Amount made in
accordance with the Agreed  Distribution Methodology and paid (or for any
other amount paid) to a public  official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar  laws.

 

 

1.8.8  _No  Other Obligation to Pay Indemnity Escrow Amount_.  Neither 
Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent, nor the Surviving Company will have any 
obligations to pay any amounts to the Stockholders with respect to the
Indemnity  Escrow Amount beyond the amounts expressly provided for above in
Section  1.8.

 



 

1.9  _Post-Closing  Adjustment to Working Capital_.

 

 

1.9.1  _Working  Capital Adjustment_.  No  later than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Effective Time, Parent shall  cause to be prepared and
delivered to Stockholders' Agent a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement")
setting forth the calculation of JJI's Working Capital  as of the Effective
Time.

 

 

1.9.2  _Post-Closing  Statement_.

 

 

1.9.2.1  The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith in a
manner  consistent with the methodology for calculating working capital as
reflected  on  ** _Exhibit  D_**.  The  Stockholders' Agent shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects with Parent (and  its representatives).

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

1.9.2.2  The Stockholders' Agent shall have twenty (20) days after the
receipt of the  Post-Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to review the
information and  calculations provided therein. During the Review Period and
the period any  dispute is pending pursuant to Section 1.9.3, Parent shall
afford the  Stockholders' Agent (and its representatives) reasonable access
to all books and  records and all financial and accounting personnel used to
prepare the  Post-Closing Statement under control of or in the possession of
Parent or the  Surviving Company.

 

 

1.9.3  _Disputes_.  The  Stockholders' Agent may dispute the calculation of
the Working Capital contained  in the Post-Closing Statement by providing
written notice to Parent of such  dispute within the Review Period, setting
forth in detail the particulars of  such dispute, including the Stockholders'
Agent's calculation of Working Capital  based on the methodology in
**_Exhibit  D_**   (a "Dispute Notice"). In the event that the
Stockholders' Agent does not deliver a  Dispute Notice within the Review
Period, then the Working Capital set forth  in  the Post-Closing Statement
shall be deemed final and binding on the parties.  In  the event a Dispute
Notice is timely provided, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall use their
reasonable best efforts for a period not to exceed thirty  (30) days (or such
longer period as to which they shall mutually agree) to  agree  on the
Working Capital. If, at the end of such period, the Stockholders' Agent  and
Parent have not agreed on a final and binding Working Capital calculation, 
the determination of the Working Capital shall be made by the Accounting
Firm.  The Parent shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting  Firm to make such determination within sixty (60) days of the end
of such  period. The Accounting Firm's determination of Working Capital shall
be based on  the methodology set forth in **_Exhibit  D_**.  The  Working
Capital determination made by the Accounting Firm shall be final and  binding
upon the parties. All fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm  shall be
paid one-half (1/2) by Parent and one-half (1/2) as a deduction from  the
Working Capital Escrow Amount. The determination of the Accounting Firm 
shall be reflected in a written report which shall be delivered promptly by 
the  Accounting Firm to the Stockholders' Agent and Parent. The Working
Capital which  is deemed final and binding on the parties, whether by
expiration of the Review  Period without a Dispute Notice, by mutual
agreement of the parties, or by  determination of the Accounting Firm, shall
be called the "Final Working  Capital". __ The  date  on which the Final
Working Capital is determined, whether by expiration of  the  Review Period
without a Dispute Notice, by mutual agreement of the parties,  or  by
determination of the Accounting Firm, shall be called the "Determination 
Date" _._

 

 

1.9.4  _Payment  of Working Capital Adjustment_. 

 



 

1.9.4.1  _Increase  of Merger Consideration and Related Payment_.  If the 
Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, the
Merger  Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to such excess
unless the  amount of such excess exceeds the Initial Working Capital Escrow
Amount in  which  case the Merger Consideration shall be increased only by
an amount equal to  the  Initial Working Capital Escrow Amount (the amount
of such increase is the "Working Capital Excess"). Parent shall cause the
Working Capital Excess to be  paid promptly to the Escrow Agent following the
Determination Date for deposit  into the escrow account designated for the
Working Capital Escrow Amount. If  there is a Working

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Capital  Excess, the Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall promptly direct
the Escrow  Agent to disburse (and the intended recipient shall be entitled
to demand from  the Escrow Agent and receive) the full amount of the Working
Capital Escrow  Amount (after any required deduction for fees and
disbursements of the  Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 1.9.3) in
accordance with the Agreed  Escrow Distribution Methodology.

 



 

The  Working Capital Excess payable from the Working Capital Escrow Amount
shall  be  the sole source of payment for holders of Merger Consideration
Rights for any  increase in Merger Consideration relating to the Final
Working  Capital.

 



 

1.9.4.2  _Decrease  of Merger Consideration and Related Payment_.  If the 
Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, the Merger 
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such shortfall unless 
such shortfall exceeds the Initial Working Capital Escrow Amount in which
case  the Merger Consideration shall be decreased only by an amount equal to
the  Initial Working Capital Escrow Amount (the amount of such decrease is
the "Working Capital Shortfall"). If there is a Working Capital Shortfall,
the  Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall direct the Escrow Agent to
disburse  (and the intended recipient shall be entitled to demand from the
Escrow Agent  and receive) the Working Capital Escrow Amount (after any
required deduction  for  fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm in
accordance with Section 1.9.3)  as follows:

 



 

1.9.4.2.1  _No  Working Capital Payment to Stockholders_.  If the  Working
Capital Shortfall is equal to or greater than the Working Capital Escrow 
Amount (after any required deduction for fees and disbursements of the 
Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 1.9.3), then the holders of
Merger  Consideration Rights shall not receive any disbursement from the
Working Capital  Escrow Amount. The Parent shall be entitled to receive from
the Escrow Agent,  by  wire transfer, the full amount of the Working Capital
Escrow Amount. The Working  Capital Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of
payment for any Working  Capital Shortfall.

 



 

1.9.4.2.2  _Working  Capital Payment to Stockholders_.  If the  Working
Capital Shortfall is less than the Working Capital Escrow Amount (after  any
required deduction for fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm in 
accordance with Section 1.9.3) then Parent shall be entitled to receive from 
the  Escrow Agent, by wire transfer, the Working Capital Shortfall. The
Escrow Agent  shall disburse the remaining balance of the Working Capital
Escrow Amount (after  any required deduction for fees and disbursements of
the Accounting Firm in  accordance with Section 1.9.3) in accordance with the
Agreed Escrow Distribution  Methodology.

 



 

1.9.4.3  _No  Change in Merger Consideration_.  If the  Final Working
Capital is equal to the Estimated Working Capital, the Merger  Consideration
shall not be adjusted. The Parent and the Stockholders' Agent  shall direct
the Escrow Agent to disburse (and the intended recipient shall  be  entitled
to demand from the Escrow Agent and receive) the full amount of  the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Working  Capital Escrow Amount in accordance with the Agreed Escrow
Distribution  Methodology.

 



 

1.9.4.4  _Payments  to Non-Claiming Holders_. 

 



 

1.9.4.4.1  If a Non-Claiming Holder surrenders his, her or its Certificate(s)
and duly  tenders his, her or its duly executed Letter(s) of Transmittal
(with such  modifications, if any, made in accordance with Section 1.4.6.3)
in accordance  with Section 1.4.6 following the Parent's receipt of any
disbursements from the  Working Capital Escrow Amount made in accordance with
the Agreed Distribution  Methodology, then the Surviving Company will cause
to be paid to any such  Non-Claiming Holder (subject to Sections 1.4.6.8 and
1.8.7.2) an amount equal  to  the amount (without interest and reduced for
any amounts required to be withheld  under the Code with respect to the
making of such payment) such Non-Claiming  Holder would have otherwise
received but did not receive as a result of being  a  Non-Claiming Holder.

 

1.9.4.4.2  Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.9.4.4.1, neither
Parent, nor any  Affiliate of Parent, nor the Surviving Company shall be
liable to any  Non-Claiming Holder for any disbursements Parent received from
the Working  Capital Escrow Amount made in accordance with the Agreed
Distribution  Methodology and paid (or for any other amount paid) to a public
official  pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

1.9.4.5  _No  Other Obligation to Pay Working Capital Escrow Amount_. 
Neither  Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent, nor the Surviving Company will
have any  obligations to pay any amounts to the Stockholders with respect to
the Working  Capital Escrow Amount beyond the amounts expressly provided for
above in Section  1.9.

JJI to enter  into this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which it
is a party. Each  Subsidiary of JJI, including the German Parent and

or expose JJI and its Subsidiaries collectively to  Adverse Consequences in
excess of $50,000 in the aggregate. JJI and its  Subsidiaries, including the
German Parent and Hoffmeister, have heretofore  made  available to Parent's

2.11.1  The real estate ("Real Estate") listed in Schedule 2.11 constitutes
all of the  real property owned, leased, subleased, or used by JJI or any of
its  Subsidiaries. Schedule 2.11 further describes any Real Estate with
respect  to  which JJI or any of its Subsidiaries is a lessor or sublessor.
A true and  complete copy of each lease has heretofore been made available to
Parent. Use  of  the Real Estate for the various purposes for which it is

structures,  fixtures or other improvements primarily situated on adjoining
property which  encroach on any part of the

a public road  via  a permanent, irrevocable, appurtenant easement
benefiting such land and  comprising a part of the Owned Real Estate, (ii) is
supplied with public or  quasi-public utilities and other services
appropriate for the operations located  thereon and (iii) is not located
within any flood plain or area subject to  wetlands regulation or any similar
restriction. There is no existing or proposed  plan to modify or realign any
street or highway or any existing or proposed  eminent domain proceeding that

that would prevent or hinder the continued use of  any  Owned Real Estate as
heretofore used in the conduct of the business of JJI  and  its
Subsidiaries.

(i) in  compliance with all applicable Laws, including those pertaining to
zoning,  building and the disabled, (ii) in good repair and in good
condition, ordinary  wear and tear excepted, and (iii) free from latent and
patent defects. To JJI's  Knowledge, no part of any Improvement on the Leased
Real Estate encroaches  on  any real property not included in the Leased
Real Estate, and there are no  buildings, structures, fixtures or other
improvements primarily situated on  adjoining property which encroach on any
part of the Leased Real Estate. To  JJI's Knowledge, the land which is a part
of the Leased Real Estate (i) abuts on  and has direct vehicular access to a
public road or has access to a public  road  via a permanent, irrevocable,
appurtenant easement benefiting such land and  comprising a part of the
Leased Real Estate, (ii) is supplied with public or  quasi-public utilities
and other services appropriate for the operations located  thereon and (iii)
is not located within any flood plain or area subject to  wetlands regulation
or any similar restriction. To JJI's Knowledge, there is no  existing or
proposed plan to modify or realign any street or highway or any  existing or
proposed eminent domain proceeding that would result in the taking  of all or
any part of any Leased Real Estate or that would prevent or hinder  the 
continued use of any Leased Real Estate as heretofore used in the conduct of 
the  business of JJI and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

2.11.4  Each of JJI or one of its Subsidiaries has, and at the Effective Time

reflected on Schedule  2.11 except for Real Estate described as leased on
Schedule 2.11 and with  respect to the Real Estate described as leased on
Schedule 2.11, JJI or one  of  its Subsidiaries has, and at the Effective

Real Estate.

 



 

2.11.5  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11.5, each of JJI and its
Subsidiaries has  good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all
personal property (in each  case, tangible and intangible) used by JJI or
necessary to permit JJI and its  Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses as
currently conducted. The personal  properties (in each case, tangible and
intangible), owned or used by JJI and  its  Subsidiaries are in satisfactory
condition and repair for their continued use  as  they have been used and
adequate in all material respects for their current  use,  subject to
reasonable wear and tear.

 



 

2.11.6  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11.6, to the Knowledge of JJI, the
buildings,  plants and structures (collectively, the "Improvements") and
equipment of JJI  and its

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Subsidiaries,  whether owned or leased by JJI or its Subsidiaries, are
structurally sound,  are  in good operating condition and repair, and are
adequate for the uses to which  they are being put, and none of such
Improvements or equipment is in need of  maintenance or repairs except for
ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs  that  are not material in nature
or cost. To the Knowledge of JJI, the Improvements  and equipment of JJI and
its Subsidiaries are sufficient for the continued  use  by JJI and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing in substantially the same manner  as used by
JJI and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. No portion of JJI's or  any of
its Subsidiaries' Real Estate has suffered any material damage by fire or 
other casualty loss that has not heretofore been repaired and restored in
all  material respects to its original condition or otherwise remedied.

Improvements,  or personal property of JJI or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any Liens  other than Permitted Encumbrances, and there are no
facts, circumstances or  conditions that, to the Knowledge of JJI, are
reasonably likely to result in  any  Liens (including Liens arising under
Environmental Laws) other than Permitted  Encumbrances against the Real
Estate or personal property of JJI or any of  its  Subsidiaries. Except as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect, each of JJI  and each of its
Subsidiaries has received all deeds, assignments, waivers,  consents,
nondisturbance and attornment or similar agreements, bills of sale  and 
other documents, and has duly effected all recordings, filings and other
actions  necessary to establish, protect and perfect JJI's and each such
Subsidiary's  right, title and interest in and to all such Real Estate and
material personal  property. Schedule 2.11 also describes any purchase
options, rights of first  refusal or other similar contractual rights or
obligations pertaining to any  Real Estate and material personal property.
All material permits required to  have been issued or appropriate to enable
the Real Estate to be lawfully  occupied and used for all of the purposes for
which it is currently occupied  and  used have been lawfully issued and are
in full force and effect.

2.13.1  Schedule 2.13.1 contains a true and complete list of each "employee
benefit  plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) and all other
employee  benefit

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

plans,  contracts, agreements, practices, policies or arrangements, written
or oral  and  whether or not subject to ERISA, which JJI or any of its
Subsidiaries maintains,  contributes to, is a party to or otherwise has or
could have any obligation  under, with respect to any current or former
officer, director, employee and/or  independent contractor of JJI or its
Subsidiaries, as of the Effective Time  (collectively, the "Plans"),
including the following plans: all employment,  severance, change-in-control
and fringe benefit plans; all stock option, stock  bonus and stock purchase
programs; all retirement income, pension benefit or  other retirement plan or
benefit; all bonus, profit sharing, gain sharing,  deferred compensation,
retention bonus, or other similar plans.

 



 

2.13.2  Each Plan (and each related trust or insurance contract) complies in
form and  in  operation in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of ERISA  and  the Code. All  required reports and
descriptions (including but not limited to Form 5500 annual  reports and
required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms  PBGC-1 and
summary plan descriptions) have been filed or distributed  appropriately with
respect to each Plan. All required Tax filings with respect  to each Plan
have been made, and any Taxes due in connection with such filings  have been
paid. All  contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary  reduction contributions), premiums and expenses which are due have
been paid  to  or on behalf of each Plan and appropriate accruals have been
made for amounts  not yet due but accrued. Each Plan that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) and is
intended to be qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Pension
Benefit Plan"), has timely applied  for or received a determination letter
from the IRS or the prototype sponsor  with respect to any prototype plan has
timely applied for or received an opinion  letter from the IRS to the effect
that it meets the requirements of Section  401(a) of the Code and, to JJI's
knowledge, no facts exist that would adversely  affect the qualified status
of any such Pension Benefit Plan other than the  failure to make any required
amendments, the time for the adoption of which  has  not expired. The trusts
maintained under such Pension Benefit Plans are exempt  from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code. Neither JJI nor any of its  Subsidiaries nor any
trustee or any fiduciary of any of the Plans has engaged  in  any prohibited
transaction within the meaning of Sections 406 or 407 of ERISA  or  Section
4975 of the Code with respect to any of the Plans that could result  in  the
imposition of any material liability on such Plan or JJI or for which no 
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(d) of the Code. 

 



 

2.13.3  Except  as  set forth in Schedule 2.13.3, neither JJI nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any  obligations for retiree health and life benefits
under any Plan, other than  coverage as may be required under Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title  I  of ERISA. To JJI's Knowledge, no event or
condition exists with respect to a  Plan that could subject JJI to Tax under
Section 4980B of the Code.

 



 

2.13.4  Except as set forth in Schedule 2.13.4, as of the last day of the
most recent  prior plan year, the market value of assets under each Pension
Benefit Plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Defined Benefit Pension
Plan"), other than any  Multiemployer Plan, equaled or exceeded the present
value of benefit liabilities  thereunder (determined in accordance with the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

actuarial  valuation assumptions described on Schedule 2.13.4). No Defined
Benefit Pension  Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) has, in the past
five years, been  completely or partially terminated or been the subject of a
Reportable Event  as  to which notices would be required to be filed with
the PBGC. No proceeding  by  the PBGC to terminate any Defined Benefit
Pension Plan (other than any  Multiemployer Plan) has been instituted. In the
past five years, neither JJI  nor  any Subsidiary has incurred any liability
to the PBGC (other than PBGC premium  payments) or otherwise under Title IV
of ERISA (including any withdrawal  liability) with respect to any Defined
Benefit Pension Plan that JJI or any  Subsidiary maintains or to which JJI or
any Subsidiary contributes for the  benefit of any current or former
employee.

 



 

2.13.5  Except as provided in Schedule 2.13.5, (i) no transaction or event
has occurred  with respect to any Plan which would be reasonably likely to
result in a  liability which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse  Effect; (ii) neither JJI nor its Subsidiaries has any
commitment, intention  or  understanding to create, modify, terminate or
adopt any Plan that would result  in any additional liability to Parent or
its Subsidiaries; and (iii) since  the  beginning of the current fiscal year
of any Plan, no event has occurred and  no  condition or circumstance has
existed which would be reasonably likely to result  in a material increase in
the benefits under or the expense of maintaining  such  Plan maintained by
JJI and/or its Subsidiaries from the level of benefits or  expenses incurred
for the most recently completed fiscal year of such  Plan.

 



 

2.13.6  At  all times on and after the effective date of ERISA, neither JJI
nor any of  JJI's  Subsidiaries has maintained, contributed to or otherwise
had any obligation  with  respect to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA)  ("Multiemployer Plan") except as set forth on
Schedule 2.13.6, and neither JJI  nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
withdrawal or other liability or exposure  under any Multiemployer Plan
except as set forth on Schedule  2.13.6.

 



 

2.13.7  Except as provided in Schedule 2.13.7, the execution and performance
of the  Transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or
upon  the  occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under  any  Plan or agreement that will or may reasonably be expected
to result in any  payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, vesting or  increase in benefits with respect to any employee,
former employee or director  or officer of JJI, or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

2.13.8  THIS SECTION INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.

 



 

2.13.9  To  the Knowledge of JJI, neither JJI nor its Subsidiaries
maintained any Plan  which  is a "group health plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the  Code) that has not been administered
and operated in all respects in compliance  with the applicable requirements
of Section 601 of ERISA and Section 4980(b)  of  the Code, and JJI and its
Subsidiaries are not subject to any liability,  including, without
limitation, additional contributions, fines, penalties or  loss of tax
deduction as a result of such administration and  operation.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

2.13.10  With respect to each Plan that is funded wholly or partially through
an  insurance policy, there will be no liability of JJI or any Subsidiary as
of  the  Effective Time under any such insurance policy or ancillary
agreement with  respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a
retroactive rate adjustment,  loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent liability arising wholly  or partially out of events occurring
prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

2.13.11  No charge, complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, claim  or  demand with respect to the investment of the
assets or the administration of  any  Plan that JJI or any Subsidiary
maintains or to which JJI or any Subsidiary  contributes or the benefit of
any current or former employee of JJI or any  Subsidiary (other than a
routine claim for benefit) is pending.

 



 

2.13.12  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.13.12, neither JJI nor any entity
considered  under common control with JJI (within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c), (m)  or  (o) of the Code) has incurred any liability in
connection with the termination  of a Pension Benefit Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA, the complete or partial  withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or the  failure to make contributions due under
Section 412 of the Code or premiums  due  to the PBGC under Title IV of
ERISA, which liability will not have been  satisfied as of the Effective
Time.

 



 

2.13.13  With respect to all operations of JJI and its Subsidiaries other
than those  operations in the United States, the Plans have at all times
substantially  complied with and been administered in accordance with
applicable Laws,  regulations and government taxation or funding
requirements. In particular,  but  without limitation, JJI does not have
Knowledge of any failure to comply with  any applicable Law, regulation or
requirement, or any other circumstance, which  would or is likely to result
in the loss of tax approval or other regulatory  approval for any of the
Plans which are intended to have such  approval.

to  JJI  and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (the Contractual Obligations
of a type  covered by clauses (i) to (xxv), including all standard form
agency agreements,  sales representative agreements, distributor agreements
and any other form  Contractual Obligations used by JJI or any of its

complete copies of each such Material  Contract. Schedule 2.14 also lists,
respectively, all parties, other than JJI  or  any of its Subsidiaries, to
JJI's agency agreements, sales representative  agreements and distributor
agreements.

 

 

2.14.2  Each Material Contract is a legal, valid, and binding obligation of
JJI or  the  applicable Subsidiary of JJI (as the case may be) and, to the
Knowledge of  JJI,  of each other party thereto, enforceable against each
party in accordance with  its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be
limited by applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or  similar Laws generally affecting the rights of
creditors and subject to general  equity principles.

 

 

2.14.3  Except as set forth in Schedule 2.14 or as would not reasonably be
expected  to  have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) since January 1, 2004, no
other party to  a  Material Contract has canceled or otherwise terminated
any Material Contract  or  has provided written or oral notice to JJI or any
of its Subsidiaries of its  intent to do so and (ii) to the Knowledge of JJI,
no third party to any Material  Contract is unable to continue to perform its
obligations  thereunder.

 

 

2.14.4  Neither JJI nor any Subsidiary of JJI is in default under any

policy or  other  instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets,
business, or operations  may be bound or affected, or under which it or its
respective assets, business  or operations receives benefits, and there has
not occurred any event that,  with  the lapse of time or the giving of

accelerate the maturity or performance of,  or  to cancel, terminate, or
modify such contract, agreement, commitment,  arrangement, lease, insurance
policy or other instrument.  To the  Knowledge of JJI, except as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect, no party  other than JJI or a Subsidiary of
JJI is in default under any Contractual  Obligation, agreement, commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or  other  instrument to which it is a
party, by which its assets, business, or operations  may be bound or
affected, or under which it or its respective assets, business  or operations
receives benefits, and there has not occurred any event that,  with  the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a 
default or give JJI or any Subsidiary of JJI or any other party the right to 
exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of, 
or  to cancel, terminate, or modify such contract, agreement, commitment, 
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument.

 



 

2.14.5  None of the Transactions will conflict with, result in a Breach of,
or  constitute a default (with due notice or lapse of time or both), under
any  Contractual Obligation binding on JJI or any of its Subsidiaries where
such  violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

will  have  (or a fully informed Person would reasonably expect then to
have) in the  aggregate, Adverse Consequences in excess of $50,000.

 



 

2.14.6  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.14.6 and matters which would not
have a  Material Adverse Effect, none of the Transactions will trigger a
consent  requirement under any Contractual Obligation binding on JJI or any
of its  Subsidiaries or result in the termination of any Contractual
Obligation binding  on JJI or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

2.14.7  Following the payment of the amount specified in each Pay Off Letter
relating  to  a Terminated Contract at or within a reasonable time following
the Effective  Time (i) neither JJI nor any Subsidiary of JJI will have any
obligation  following the Effective Time in connection with any Terminated
Contract except  an obligation to provide employee benefits (including any
applicable severance  benefits) in accordance with Parent's applicable policy
at the relevant time,  awarding credit for service of such employee with JJI
and (ii) the obligations  of the employee which existed under such Terminated
Contract with respect to  any  period prior to the Effective Time shall
continue to be fully enforceable by  JJI  and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

2.15  _Insurance_.  Schedule 2.15 lists all insurance policies of any nature
maintained, as of  the  Effective Time, for current occurrences by JJI, as
well as a summary of the  key  business terms of each such policy such as
deductibles, coverage limits and  term  of policy.

 



 

2.16  _Taxes  and Tax Returns_.  All Tax  Returns required to be filed
(taking into account all applicable extensions)  by  JJI and its
Subsidiaries have been timely and properly filed. All Taxes that  are  due
and payable (other than Taxes being contested in good faith by appropriate 
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been provided for in
accordance  with GAAP) have been paid. All such Tax Returns and amendments
thereto are  true,  complete and correct in all material respects. No
Governmental Authority has  asserted (either in the form of a communication
directed specifically to JJI  or  any of its Subsidiaries or in connection
with any audit, examination,  investigation, administrative proceeding or
court proceeding) in writing any  claim or adjustment for Taxes, or to JJI's
Knowledge, threatened to assert any  claim or adjustment for Taxes that was
not fully satisfied prior to December  31,  2005. All Taxes required by Law
to be withheld or collected and remitted  (including, without limitation,
income tax, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation premiums) with
respect to JJI and each of its Subsidiaries have  been withheld or collected
and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authorities  (or are properly being
held for such payment).

 



 

2.16.1  JJI and each of its Subsidiaries have made adequate provision as
reflected  on  their Financial Statements for any Taxes that are not yet due
and payable for  all taxable periods, or portions thereof, required by GAAP
to be reflected  on  the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements
or provided pursuant  to  Section 4.17. The unpaid Taxes of JJI and its
Subsidiaries (i) did not, as  of  the most recent Financial Statements of
JJI and its Subsidiaries, exceed to  any  material extent the reserve for
Tax liability (rather than any reserve for  deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax  income) set forth on the
face of such Financial Statements (rather than in  any  notes thereto), and
(ii) do not exceed that

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

reserve  as adjusted for the passage of time since the date of such Financial
Statements  in accordance with the past custom and practice of JJI and its
Subsidiaries  in  filing their Tax Returns.

 



 

2.16.2  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.16, no Federal, state, local or
foreign  audits, examinations, investigations or other administrative
proceedings or  court proceedings are presently pending or threatened in
writing with regard  to  any Taxes or Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of
JJI or any of its  Subsidiaries.

 



 

2.16.3  There are no liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of JJI or
any of its  Subsidiaries, except for liens for Taxes not yet due or for Taxes
being  contested in good faith for which adequate reserves have been made on
the  Financial Statements.

 



 

2.16.4  Neither JJI nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any compensation
plans,  programs or arrangements the payments under which would not
reasonably be  expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations under
Section 162(m)  of  the Code or the regulations issued thereunder.

 



 

2.17  _Inactive  Subsidiary_.  Yort  does not have assets having an
aggregate value in excess of $50,000, and  conducts no business and does not
have any Liabilities or obligations other  than  Liabilities relating to the
Omega Chemical Site or Puente Valley  Site.

 



 

2.18  _Stockholders '  Agent_.  Upon  consummation of the Merger, the
Stockholders' Agent will serve as the  representative of the Stockholders who
have delivered Letters of Transmittal  as  contemplated by this Agreement
and act on behalf of the Stockholders who have  delivered Letters of
Transmittal as contemplated by this Agreement with respect  to matters
expressly set forth in this Agreement to be or which may be performed  by the
Stockholders' Agent. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely upon 
any action taken by the Stockholders' Agent as if it is the action of the 
Stockholders who have delivered Letters of Transmittal as contemplated by
this  Agreement.

 



 

2.19 _Disclaimer  of Other Representations and Warranties_.  Except  as
otherwise provided in this Agreement:

 

 

2.19.1 **JJI  HAS NOT MADE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, OF ANY  NATURE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO JJI OR THE BUSINESS OF JJI OR

AGREEMENT.**

 

 

2.19.2 Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the
representations and  warranties set forth in this Agreement, (i) neither JJI
nor any representative  of JJI has made, and shall not be deemed to have
made, any representations  or  warranties in the materials relating to the
business of JJI made available  to  Parent and Merger Sub, including due

information or any memoranda or offering materials or presentations,

warranties of JJI,  and (ii) such matters are not and shall not be deemed
relied upon by Parent  or  Merger Sub in executing, delivering and
performing this Agreement and the  Transactions contemplated hereby.

obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business  and  consistent
with past practice **** or  except  as set forth on Schedule 2.20, since
December 31, 2005, neither JJI nor any  of  its Subsidiaries has incurred
any Liabilities of any nature, whether or not  accrued, contingent or

Reduction Liabilities, Working Capital Liabilities,  Liabilities which are
Agreed Deductions, or the Liabilities specified in part  (i), (ii) or (iii)
of Section 1.7.1.3.5, all of which Pay Off Liabilities,  Price  Reduction
Liabilities and Liabilities which are Agreed Deductions shall be  fully  and
accurately disclosed to Parent in certificates delivered at the Closing 
pursuant to Section 5.2.4. Neither JJI nor any Subsidiary of JJI will have 
any  Liability in connection with the subject matter of any Pay Off Liability
which  is paid in accordance with the Pay Off Letter relating to that Pay
Off  Liability.

 

 

2.21  _Inventory_.  Except  as set forth in Schedule 2.21, all of the
Inventory of JJI and each of its  Subsidiaries consists of a quality and
quantity usable and salable in the  ordinary and usual course of business,
except for items of obsolete materials  and materials of below-standard
quality, all of which items have been written  off or written down on the
applicable balance sheet to fair market value or  for  which adequate
reserves have been provided therein. All Inventories not written  off have
been and will be valued in each of the Financial Statements and will  be 
valued in calculating Working Capital at the lower of cost or market on a
first  in first out basis, all in accordance with GAAP. To the Knowledge of
JJI, all  of  JJI's finished goods inventory is free of any material defect
or other  deficiency.

 

 

2.22  _Accounts  Receivable_.  All  Accounts Receivable of JJI and its
Subsidiaries that are reflected on each  balance sheet included in the
Financial Statements represent or will represent  as of the effective date of
each such balance sheet valid obligations arising  from sales actually made
or services actually performed in the ordinary course  of business. Except as
set forth in Schedule 2.22, there is no contest, claim,  defense or right of
set-off, other than routine returns in the ordinary course  of business where
the aggregate volume thereof is consistent with normal prior  practice, under
any Contractual Obligation with any obligor of any Accounts  Receivable

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

relating  to the amount or validity of such Accounts Receivable or otherwise
with respect  to any Accounts Receivable. The reserve for bad debts set forth
in the balance  sheets included in the Financial Statements has been (or in
the case of the  Financial Statement referenced in Section 4.17 will, when
delivered pursuant  to  this Agreement, be) established in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent  basis.

 



 

2.23  _Takeover  Statutes Inapplicable_.  The  Board of Directors of JJI
has taken all necessary action so that no "fair  price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover Law  (each, a "Takeover
Statute") (including the interested stockholder provisions  codified in
Section 203 of the DGCL) or any anti-takeover provision in JJI's  certificate
of incorporation or bylaws is applicable to this Agreement, the  Merger or
any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To  JJI's 
Knowledge, no other Takeover Statute or similar Law, applies or purports to 
apply to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the Transactions contemplated

with the notice  provisions of Section 9.1) any variances from the

and  upon  reasonable notice to the offices, properties, personnel and,
subject to  applicable Law, books, contracts, commitments, reports,
correspondence,  documents and records of JJI and its Subsidiaries in order
for Parent to have  the opportunity to make such investigation as it shall
reasonably desire to  make  of the affairs of JJI and its Subsidiaries;
_provided,  however_ ,  that  such access shall not include any sampling of

Closing Date, the parties to this Agreement  each agree to maintain in
confidence, and will cause its respective directors,  officers, employees,
agents, and advisors to maintain in confidence, any  written, oral, or other
information obtained in confidence from another party  in  connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions, unless (i) such information  is already
known to such party or to others not bound by a duty of  confidentiality or
such information becomes publicly available through no fault  of such party,
(ii) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate  in  making any
filing or obtaining any consent or approval required for the  consummation of
the Transactions, (iii) the disclosure relates to a press  release, public
announcement or other disclosure of matters relating to this  Agreement or
the Transactions of a type which is addressed in Section 4.9 (and  such
disclosures permitted only by this part (iii) shall be subject to the 
limitations in Section 4.9), or (iv) the furnishing or use of such
information  is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with
legal proceedings  or to comply with any Law.

 



 

4.5  _Regulatory  Filings_.

 



 

4.5.1  Parent, Merger Sub and JJI shall cooperate with one another (i) in
promptly  determining whether any filings are required to be or should be
made or  consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or
should  be  obtained under any other Laws or whether any consents, approvals
or waivers  are  required to be or should be obtained from other parties to
loan agreements  or  other contracts or instruments material to JJI's or any
of its Subsidiaries' business in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement and (ii) in promptly making
any such filings, furnishing  information required in connection therewith
and seeking to obtain timely any  such consents, permits, authorizations,
approvals or waivers.

 

 

4.5.2  Notwithstanding Section 4.5.1, the parties shall promptly make any
required  submissions under the Merger Filing Laws and any other Laws which
Parent  reasonably determines should be made, in each case, with respect to
this  Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
and  JJI  shall take or undertake all such further reasonable action as may
be necessary  to resolve such objections, if any, as the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, the  Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the 
German Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt),  state  antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation  or
jurisdiction (each, a "Government Antitrust Entity") may assert under 
relevant antitrust or competition Laws or Merger Filing Laws with respect to 
the  Transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

4.5.3  Notwithstanding this Section 4.5 or any other provision of this
Agreement,  neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required, whether before
or after the  Effective Time, to hold separate (including by trust or
otherwise) or divest  any  of its business or assets or any of the
businesses or assets of JJI, or enter  into any consent decree or other
agreement that would restrict Parent or JJI  in  the conduct of its
respective businesses as heretofore conducted, or oppose  any  motion or
action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against  the
Transaction or any of the parties. Each of JJI and Parent shall keep the 
other informed of any material communication and provide to the other copies 
of  all correspondence, between it (or its advisors) and any Government
Antitrust  Entity relating to this Agreement or any of the matters described
in this  Section 4.5, and each of JJI and Parent shall permit the other to
review any  material communication to be given by it to, and shall consult
with each other  in advance of any telephonic calls, meetings or conferences
with, any Government  Antitrust Entity and, to the extent permitted, give the
other party the  opportunity to attend and participate in such telephonic
calls, meetings or  conferences with, any Government Antitrust Entity and, to
the extent permitted,  give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such  telephonic calls, meetings and conferences.
Notwithstanding any of the  foregoing, no failure to obtain termination of
the waiting period under the  HSR  Act, if applicable, shall be deemed to be
a Breach hereunder by any party to  this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing,
Parent shall be principally  responsible for and in control of the process of
dealing with any Government  Antitrust Entity relating to its obligations
under this Section  4.5.3.

 

 



 

4.6  _Consents  and Approvals; Cooperation_.  The  parties hereto each
will cooperate with one another and will use all reasonable  commercial
efforts to prepare all necessary documentation to effect promptly  all 
necessary filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals, 
orders and authorizations of or any exemptions by, all third parties and 
governmental, quasi-governmental and regulatory bodies necessary to
consummate  the Transactions contemplated herein. Each party hereto will keep
the other  parties hereto apprised of the status of any inquiries made of
such party by  any  governmental, quasi-governmental and regulatory agency
or authority or members  of their respective staffs before the Closing with
respect to this Agreement  or  the Transactions contemplated hereby.
Provided, further, each of the parties  agrees to reasonably cooperate and to
take the actions contemplated by Section  1.6 and Article VII to enable the

normal  business hours, to the books and records of the Surviving Company
with respect  to periods prior to and including the Effective Time; and

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

4.7.2  reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Surviving
Company's  senior management in connection with any matter relating to or
arising out  of  this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby.
Unless otherwise  consented to in writing by the Stockholders' Agent, Parent
shall not permit the  Surviving Company, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Effective  Time,  to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of
any books and records of the Surviving  Company, or any portions thereof,
relating to periods prior to and including  the  Effective Time without
first giving reasonable prior written notice to the  Stockholders' Agent and
offering to surrender to the Stockholders' Agent such  books and records or
such portions thereof.

 



 

4.8  _Director  and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.  For a  period
of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not  permit
the Surviving Company to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in JJI's 
organizational documents to provide less exculpation coverage or
indemnification  of any officers and/or directors (unless required by law),
it being the intent  of the parties that the officers and/or directors of JJI
shall continue to  be  entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to
the full extent of JJI's  organizational documents.

 



 

4.9  _Public  Announcements_.  Any  public announcement, press release or
similar publicity with respect to this  Agreement or the Transactions will be
issued, if at all, at such time and in  such manner as Parent determines.
Except with the prior consent of Parent or  as  permitted by this Agreement,
neither JJI, any of its Subsidiaries, the  Stockholders or their respective
representatives shall disclose to any Person  (i) the fact that any
confidential information of JJI, any of its Subsidiaries  or Stockholders has
been disclosed to Parent or Parent's Representatives, that  Parent or
Parent's Representatives have inspected any portion of the  confidential
information of JJI, any of its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders  or  their
respective representatives, or that JJI, any of its Subsidiaries, 
Stockholders or their respective representatives have inspected any portion 
of  the confidential information of Parent or Parent's Affiliates or (ii)
any  information about the Transactions, including the status of such
discussions  or  negotiations, the execution of any documents (including
this Agreement) or  any  of the terms of the Transactions or the related
documents (including this  Agreement). Parent and JJI will consult with each
other concerning the means  by  which JJI's or its Subsidiaries' employees,
customers, suppliers and others  having dealings with JJI or any of its
Subsidiaries will be informed of the  Transactions during the period prior to
Closing, and Parent will have the right  to be present for any such
communication. Notwithstanding the above, nothing  in  this Section 4.9 will
preclude any party from making any disclosures if such  party in good faith
determines that (i) the use of such information is necessary  or appropriate
in making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval  required for the
consummation of the Transactions, or (ii) the furnishing or  use  of such
information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection  with
legal proceedings or to comply with any Law or otherwise necessary and 
proper in conjunction with the filing of any Tax Return or other document 
required to be filed with any Governmental Authority.

4.10.1  _Stockholders '  Agent's Representation and Agreement_.  The 
Stockholders' Agent hereby represents and warrants to the Parent and Merger
Sub,  both as of the date of execution of this Agreement and as of the
Effective  Time,  that (i) it owns Seventy-nine and 85/100 percent (79.85%)
of the JJI Stock,  (ii)  it has duly and validly approved and been
authorized to enter into this  Agreement and the Transaction and (iii) it
agrees to cause the Transaction  to be  duly and validly authorized and
approved by JJI.

 



 

4.10.2  _JJI 's  Efforts_.  JJI  shall take all action necessary under its
certificate of incorporation and  bylaws and the DGCL to, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of  this  Agreement, call, give notice
of, convene and duly hold a meeting of the holders  of JJI Stock or otherwise
take action by consent to duly and properly consider,  act upon and vote upon
the approval of this Agreement and the  Merger.

 



 

4.11 _No  Solicitations_.  Immediately after the execution of this
Agreement, JJI will terminate and cease  any discussions or negotiations with
any parties relating to an Acquisition  Transaction, and thereafter until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the  termination of this Agreement, JJI
shall not, directly or indirectly, initiate,  solicit, or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information or  assistance), or take any
other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making  of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,  an  Acquisition
Transaction, or negotiate with any person in furtherance of such  inquiries
or to obtain an Acquisition Transaction, or agree to or endorse any 
Acquisition Transaction, or authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors,  or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant,  or other representative retained by JJI to take any
such action, and JJI shall  promptly notify Parent orally and in writing of
all of the relevant details  relating to all inquiries and proposals which it
may receive relating to any  of  such matters.

 



 

4.12  _Tax  Matters_. 

 

 

4.12.1  _Cooperation_.  Parent  and the Stockholders' Agent shall cooperate
to the extent reasonably requested  by the other party in connection with any
audit, litigation, refund claim or  other proceeding with respect to Taxes of
JJI and withholding tax. Such  cooperation shall include the retention and,
upon the other party's request, the  provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such  audit, litigation or other
proceeding. Parent shall use commercially reasonable  efforts to provide to
Stockholders' Agent for comment, at least one week before  the intended
filing date, a draft of any U.S. federal income Tax Return of  JJI  which
JJI expects to file to the extent such Tax Return relates exclusively  to 
tax periods ending before the Effective Time.

 

 

4.12.2  _Audits_.  Parent  shall notify the Stockholders' Agent in writing
within a reasonable time of  receipt by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
(including the Surviving Company)  of notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audits or assessments that may affect  the Tax liabilities of JJI for which
the Stockholders would be liable under  this  Agreement. The Stockholders'
Agent shall be kept reasonably informed of the  status of any such audit or
assessment. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company  may compromise or
settle any such Tax audits or assessments without the  Stockholders' Agent's
consent (which consent shall not be

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

unreasonably  withheld or delayed) unless (i) there is no finding or
admission of any  violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person; (ii) the sole  relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Parent or  Parent's Affiliate (including the Surviving Company);
and (iii) the Stockholders  shall have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of such  Tax  audit or assessment.

 



 

4.12.3  _Amended  Returns_.  Parent  shall not file or cause to be filed
any amended Tax Returns of JJI with respect  to a taxable period or portion

delayed).

 

 

4.12.4  _Transfer  Taxes_.  Any  real estate or other transfer Taxes
arising from the Merger shall be borne  one-half (1/2) by Parent and one-half
(1/2) by the Stockholders.

 

 

4.12.5  _No  Tax  Withholding_.  Based  on information provided by JJI,
the parties do not believe that under current  Law the payment of the Merger
Consideration is subject to withholding Tax except  for any payments of any
Merger Consideration which is compensatory in nature.  All payments of Merger
Consideration under this Agreement to the Stockholders  will be made without
any deduction or withholding for or on account of any  Taxes, except for any
such deduction or withholding that is required (and any  payment of the
Merger Consideration shall be net of any payment required) (i)  as  a result
of a change in Law or change in the interpretation of Law by any court  or
other Governmental Authority after the date of this Agreement or (ii) in 
connection with any payments of any Merger Consideration which is
compensatory  in nature.

 

 

4.12.6  _Tax  Treatment_.  For tax  purposes, each of the parties shall
treat the Transaction as a taxable purchase  of the JJI Stock and Class B
Common Stock Warrants and shall not take any  inconsistent position on any
Tax Return or in any audit or administrative or  judicial proceeding.

 

 

4.13  _Anti-Takeover  Statutes_.  If any  Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger, each of Parent  and  JJI shall take such
commercially reasonable actions as are necessary so that  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly  as 
reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and to the extent 
commercially reasonable otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects 
of  any Takeover Statute on the Merger.

 

 

4.14  _Stockholder  Litigation_.  The  parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate and consult with one another in  connection with any stockholder
litigation against any of them or any of their  respective directors or
officers with respect to the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. In
furtherance of and without in any way limiting the  foregoing, each of the
parties shall use its respective commercially reasonable  best efforts to
prevail in such litigation so as to permit the consummation  of  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the manner contemplated  by 
the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, JJI agrees that it will not 
compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors
and  officers relating to this Agreement

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

or  the  Transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without
Parent's prior  written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

4.15  _Forward  Contracts_.  If on  or before three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, JJI or the  Stockholders' Agent requests Parent to
purchase forward contract(s) that will  establish the Pay Off Liability in
U.S. dollars for any one or more of the  Hoffmeister Debt Payments,
Hoffmeister Family Expense or any Change of Control  Obligations payable in
Euros, then Parent agrees to use reasonable efforts  to  obtain such forward
contract(s) that sell U.S. dollars to exchange for Euros  on  a specified
date, which specified date shall be the Closing Date or such later  date as
agreed to by the parties (the "Forward Contracts").

4.16.1  _Stock  Option Plans_.  JJI  shall terminate any and all stock
option plans, including the Stock Incentive  Plans, of JJI and its
Subsidiaries, effective not later than the day immediately  preceding the
Closing Date, unless Parent, in its sole discretion, elects to  maintain such
plan in which event Parent shall provide JJI with written notice  of such
election at least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date. Unless  Parent
provides such notice to JJI, Parent shall receive from JJI evidence  that 
JJI's stock option plans have been terminated pursuant to resolution of
JJI's  Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolution shall be
subject  to review and approval by Parent), not later than the day
immediately preceding  the Closing Date.

 

 

4.16.2  _SERP_.  JJI  shall terminate the SERP, effective not later than
the day immediately preceding  the Closing Date, unless Parent, in its sole
discretion, elects to maintain  such  plan in which event Parent shall
provide JJI with written notice of such  election at least three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date (or such lesser  time  as may be acceptable to
Parent). Unless Parent provides such notice to JJI,  Parent shall receive
from JJI evidence that the SERP has been terminated  pursuant to resolution

4.16.3.2  _Termination_.  JJI  shall terminate the Employees Pension Plan
of JJI and its Subsidiaries,  effective not later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, unless  Parent, in its sole discretion, elects to
maintain such plan in which event  Parent shall provide JJI with written
notice of such election at least three  (3)  days prior to the Closing Date.
Unless Parent provides such notice to JJI,  Parent shall receive from JJI
evidence that the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Employees  Pension Plan of JJI and its Subsidiaries has been terminated
pursuant to  resolution of JJI's Board of Directors (the form and substance
of such  resolution shall be subject to review and approval by Parent), not
later than  the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

4.17  _Financial  Statements_.  As soon  as reasonably practicable but no
later than five (5) days before the Closing  Date (or such lesser time as may
be acceptable to Parent), JJI shall provide  Parent with consolidated balance
sheets and related statements of income and  cash flow as of the end of each
month beginning with the month of January,  2006  and for each month ending
more than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing  Date. Such monthly
financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with  GAAP and shall

local income Taxes paid by JJI prior to  the  Effective Time and losses
included on a JJI income Tax return for a period  ending prior to the
Effective Time (other than losses relating to or resulting  from the subject
matter of the Defined Benefit Pension Plan Funding or any  payment or accrual
relating thereto) which exceed the credit provided in Final  Working Capital
pursuant to part (f) of **_Exhibit  D_** ,  then  JJI will, subject to the
limitations referenced below, pay to the Escrow Agent  an amount equal to
such excess; _provided,  however_ ,  for  purposes of calculating such
excess (i) any refunds will be disregarded to  the  extent such refunds
result from or relate to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan  Funding, the
subject matter of the Defined Benefit Pension Plan or any payment  or accrual
relating to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan, and (ii) the sum of  payments
pursuant to this Section 4.18, the Final Working Capital plus any  amount
which increased the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to part (g) of 
**_Exhibit  D_**   shall  not in any event be more than $32,000,000. Within

percentages shall equal 100%). JJI shall have delivered to Parent  a 
certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Secretary of JJI certifying that the **_Exhibit  B_**   delivered at Closing
sets forth the name of each Stockholder or other Person  entitled to Merger

with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2.13.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the references  in  Articles I,

JJI to effect the Merger is also subject to the following  conditions (any or
all of which conditions may be waived by JJI at or prior  to  the Closing):

 



 

5.3.1  _Representations  and Warranties; Performance of Obligations_.  All
of  the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in
this  Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as
of the  date hereof, the Closing Date and the Effective Time as if made as of
each  such  date or time (except for those representations and warranties
made as of a  particular date, which shall have been true and correct as of
such date),  _except  that_ ,  JJI  shall not be obligated to effect the
Merger, if JJI determines, in its sole  discretion, that any one or more of
the changes in the representations and  warranties of Parent and Merger Sub
or of JJI that occurs after the date of  the  execution of this Agreement is
material to the Stockholders or materially  increases the exposure of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount to Parent Claims. Parent  and Merger Sub shall have
performed or complied (or cured any noncompliance)  in  all material
respects with all covenants required by this Agreement to be  performed or
complied with by them at or prior to the Effective  Time.

ARTICLE  VI

 

TERMINATION

 



 

6.1  _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing by:

 



 

6.1.1  the  mutual written consent of Parent and JJI;

 



 

6.1.2  Parent, if there has been a violation or Breach by JJI of any
covenant,  representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has a
Material  Adverse Effect, which violation or Breach has not been waived by
Parent or  cured  by JJI within thirty (30) days after written notice by
Parent or which Breach  cannot by its nature reasonably be cured prior to the
Expiration  Date;

 



 

6.1.3  JJI, if there has been a violation or Breach by Parent of any
covenant,  representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has a
Material  Adverse Effect which violation or Breach has not been waived by JJI
or cured  by  Parent within thirty (30) days after written notice by JJI
(provided that the  failure of Parent to deliver the Merger Consideration as
required hereunder  shall not be subject to cure hereunder) or which Breach
cannot by its nature  reasonably be cured prior to the Expiration Date; or

 



 

6.1.4  either Parent or JJI if the Transactions contemplated hereby have not
been  consummated by June 30, 2006 (the "Expiration Date"); _provided_  
that  neither Parent nor JJI shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant  to  this Section 6.1 if such Person's Breach of this Agreement has
prevented the  consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby; or

 



 

6.1.5 either  JJI or Parent, by written notice to the other, if a
Governmental Authority  shall  have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action, in any case,  having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting  the Merger, which order,
decree, ruling or other action is final and  nonappealable; or

 

 

6.1.6  if  either JJI or Parent is entitled not to close under Section 5.2.1
or 5.3.1  and  notifies the other in writing of its election not to close
pursuant to Section  5.2.1 or 5.3.1, as applicable.

 

 

In  the  event JJI has a right to terminate this Agreement under any of the
foregoing  provisions, this Agreement may be terminated by the board of
directors of JJI  as  provided above at any time prior to the Certificate of
Merger becoming effective  in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL,
notwithstanding approval of this  Agreement by the holders of JJI Stock.

 



 

6.2  _Effect  of Termination_.  In the  event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or JJI as provided  above, the provisions of this
Agreement shall immediately become void and of  no  further force and effect
(other than this Section 6.2, Section 4.4.2  (Confidentiality), Section 4.9
(Public Announcements), Section 9.7 (Governing  Law) and Section 9.9 (Fees
and Expenses), which shall each survive the  termination of this Agreement)
except as provided in the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

immediately  following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party
may seek  specific performance with respect to the obligations of any other
party pursuant  to this Agreement including any obligation to complete the
Transactions, but  any  party exercising its rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Article  VI may not bring a claim for monetary
damages against any other party based  on  such other party's failure to
comply with an obligation to complete the  Closing.

 



 

ARTICLE  VII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

7.1  _Survival;  Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge_. 
All  representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in
this  Agreement, and in any certificate or schedule shall be deemed to have
been  relied upon by the parties hereto, and shall survive the Closing;
_provided_   that any  such representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements shall be fully  effective and enforceable after the Closing for a
period of twenty-one (21)  months after the Effective Time for all matters,
including claims relating  to  Environmental Liabilities, Taxes and all
other matters (the "General Survival  Period") and for an additional period
of twenty-one (21) months after the  General Survival Period for Parent
Claims relating to Taxes and German  Environmental Issues (the "Tax and
German Environmental Issue Survival Period"),  and shall thereafter be of no
further force or effect except as provided in  this  Agreement. Following
the end of the General Survival Period and of the Tax  and  German
Environmental Issue Survival Period and notwithstanding anything in  this 
Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligations set forth in this 
Article VII shall continue to survive with respect to (i) any Surviving
Claim  or  Stockholder Claim which was not fully resolved at the end of the
General  Survival Period and (ii) any Continuing Surviving Claim which was
not fully  resolved at the end of the Tax and German Environmental Issue
Survival Period,  until finally resolved as provided in this Article VII and
the Escrow Agreement.  By way of example, if notice of a Parent Claim is sent
within the applicable  survival period, then subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow  Agreement the  Parent Indemnified Party or Parent,
as applicable, shall be entitled to be  reimbursed from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount until all Adverse Consequences  (whether arising before or after the
end of the applicable survival period)  relating to such timely asserted
Parent Claim have been fully resolved and  Parent or the Parent Indemnified
Party, as applicable, has been indemnified  therefor. The  right  to
indemnification, payment of Adverse Consequences or other remedy based on 
the  representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations of the parties
hereto  or  in any schedule, certificate or other document delivered in
connection herewith  will not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any  knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before  or  after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the Effective Time, with  respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such  representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation.
The waiver of any condition  based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance  of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, will not affect the right  to  indemnification, payment of
Adverse Consequences, or other remedy based on  such  representations,
warranties, covenants, and obligations. Provided, however,  the  limitations
contained in this Section shall not limit (i) the ability of any  party to
obtain specific performance

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

with  respect to any obligation of the other party or parties and each party
to this  Agreement shall be entitled to specifically enforce the obligations
of each  other party in this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, (ii)  any  Parent Indemnified Party in being paid for indemnifiable
Adverse Consequences  for claims for which notice was sent in the applicable
time period or (iii)  any  party from enforcing its right to obtain or
require distributions in accordance  with Section 1.8.

 

 

7.2  _Indemnification  of Parent_.  Subject  to the limitations of
Sections 7.4 and 7.6, each Stockholder, severally with  respect to such
Stockholder's portion of the Merger Consideration, shall be  deemed to have
agreed, by virtue of the approval of this Agreement and the  Merger by JJI's
Board of Directors and the approval of this Agreement by the  Stockholders
under JJI's Governing Documents and the DGCL to indemnify, defend,  and save
Parent and the Surviving Company, and their directors, officers,  employees,
owners, agents, Affiliates, and their respective successors and  assigns
(each a "Parent Indemnified Party") harmless on an after-tax basis from  and
against, and to promptly pay to a Parent Indemnified Party or reimburse  a 
Parent Indemnified Party for any and all Adverse Consequences arising from 
or in  connection with:

 



 

7.2.1  any  violation or Breach of any representation or warranty made by
JJI in (i) this  Agreement, (ii) the Schedules hereto (without giving effect
to any supplement  to  the Schedules hereto), (iii) the documents and
certificates delivered pursuant  to Section 5.2, or (iv) any other
certificate, document, writing or instrument  delivered by JJI pursuant to
this Agreement; _provided,  however_ ,  for  purposes of determining the
indemnity obligations pursuant to this Section  7.2,  any representation or
warranty which is qualified or otherwise limited by a  term  such as
"Material Adverse Effect", "materiality", "material" or any other  similar
term shall be interpreted as if such qualification or limitation were  not
included (thus, a Breach will be deemed to exist based on a reading as 
though such qualification or limitation did not exist), each Stockholder
will  be  obligated to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties as though that
qualification  or limitation did not exist and indemnifiable Adverse
Consequences will be  determined as if such qualification or limitation were
not  included;

 



 

7.2.2  any  failure of JJI to perform, fulfill or satisfy any covenant or
agreement  contained herein or in any certificate or schedule delivered by
JJI pursuant  to  this Agreement;

 



 

7.2.3  any  brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments
based upon any  agreement or understanding made, or alleged to have been
made, by any Person  with JJI (or any other Person acting on their behalf) in
connection with the  Transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

7.2.4  any  matter disclosed on, referenced in or resulting from or in
connection with  the  subject matter of (i) numerical paragraphs 1, 3, 4 or
5 of Schedule 2.10 or  (ii)  the audit referenced in numerical paragraph (1)
of Schedule 2.13.1.

 



 

7.2.5  any  German Environmental Issues;

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

7.2.6  any  failure by JJI or any Subsidiary of JJI to comply with any Law
at any time  prior  to the Effective Time;

 



 

7.2.7  any  Contract Termination Expense or Change of Control Obligation;

 



 

7.2.8  any  Terminated Contract;

 



 

7.2.9  the  amount required to resolve the Austrian Director Issue exceeding
$50,800; 

 



 

7.2.10   (i) the anticipated Tax refunds credited to Final Working Capital
pursuant  to  part (f) of **Exhibit  D**   being  more than those ****
claimed  by JJI (but only to the extent of such refunds claimed by JJI which
relate  only  to the subject matter of the refunds credited to Final Working
Capital pursuant  to part (f) of **Exhibit  D**   and  exclusive of any
claimed refunds relating to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan  Funding, the
subject matter of the Defined Benefit Pension Plan or any  benefit relating
to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan) on its U.S. federal,  state and local
income Tax returns filed after the Effective Time for periods  ending prior
to the Effective Time **** or  (ii)  the amount of any disallowance or
recovery by the Internal Revenue Service  of  any such refunds so credited
to Final Working Capital as reasonably  determined by Parent; and

 



 

7.2.11  the purchase of shares of JJI pursuant to Section 4.16.3.1 to the
extent not  deducted from the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 
1.7.1.1.7.

 

 

Notwithstanding  the fact that the obligations or the duties of the
Stockholders under this  Section 7.2 are several rather than joint and
several, the fact that all  Stockholders may not have entered into
Transmittal Letters or expressly  appointed the Stockholders' Agent as their
agent or any other limitation  contained in this Agreement, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled  to  receive from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount the full amount of Adverse Consequences  for the matters set forth in
Section 7.2.1 through Section 7.2.11 subject only  to the limitations of
Sections 7.4 and 7.6. Accordingly, notwithstanding any  other provision of
this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that the total  consideration
which each Stockholder (other than a Dissenting Stockholder)  is entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger as a result of the conversion  of  the
Stockholder\'s shares into the right to receive cash shall be such 
Stockholder\'s respective portions (determined as set forth on **_Exhibit 
B_** )  of the  Merger Consideration Rights. Rights to payments from the
Working Capital  Escrow Amount or the Indemnity Escrow Amount (whether to 
Stockholders, Stockholders\' Agent or a Parent Indemnified Party) pursuant
to  this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement are, thus, (i) part of the 
methodology for determining the Stockholders\' rights to consideration in 
connection with the Merger and (ii) binding on all the Stockholders (except 
those who become Dissenting Stockholders) at the Effective Time.

 

 

7.3  _Indemnification  of Stockholders._ Parent  agrees to indemnify,
defend, and save the Stockholders and, as applicable,  their  directors,
managers, officers, employees, owners, agents, trustees, Affiliates,  and
their respective successors and assigns or heirs and personal 
representatives, as the case may be (each, a "Stockholder Indemnified
Party"),  harmless on an

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

after-tax  basis from and against, and to promptly pay to such Stockholder
Indemnified  Party or reimburse such Stockholder Indemnified Party for, any
and all Adverse  Consequences arising from or in connection with:

 



 

7.3.1  any  violation or Breach of any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Merger  Sub in (i) this Agreement, (ii) the Schedules hereto
(without giving effect  to  any supplement to the Schedules hereto), (iii)
the documents and certificates  delivered pursuant to Section 5.3, or (iv)
any other certificate, document,  writing or instrument delivered by Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to this  Agreement;

 



 

7.3.2  any  failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform, fulfill or satisfy
any covenant  or  agreement contained herein or in any certificate delivered
by Parent or Merger  Sub pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

7.3.3  any  brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments
based upon any  agreement or understanding made, or alleged to have been
made, by any Person  with Parent or Merger Sub (or any other Person acting on
their behalf) in  connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby; and

 



 

7.3.4  any  election by Parent under Section 338 of the Code with respect to
its acquisition  of the capital stock of JJI in connection with the Merger.

 



 

**The  Stockholder Indemnified Parties are not entitled to receive any
payment from  the  Indemnity Escrow Amount for any Adverse Consequences
suffered by one or more  Stockholder Indemnified Parties. Provided, however,

Merger Consideration, shall indemnify,  defend, and save harmless the Parent
Indemnified Parties for all Adverse  Consequences exceeding the Parent Basket
up to the amount of the Cap (if  applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Sub on the other hand, for  all Adverse Consequences suffered by an
Indemnified Party with respect to the  subject matter of this Agreement and

equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the  "Cap"); _provided,  however_ , 
the Cap  shall not apply to or take into account (i) Adverse Consequences
related to  adjustments  relating to Working Capital, (ii)  Adverse 
Consequences suffered by a Stockholder Indemnified Party relating to any 
Stockholders Limitation Exception or (iii) Adverse Consequences suffered by 
a  Parent Indemnified Party relating to any Parent Limitation  Exception.

7.5  _Indemnification  Procedure for Third Party Claims Against Indemnified
Parties_.

 

 

7.5.1  _Notice_. 

 

 

7.5.1.1  _Duty  to Notify_.  In the  event that subsequent to the Closing
any Parent Indemnified Party or Stockholder  Indemnified Party (each, an
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of the  assertion of any claim or of the
commencement of any action or proceeding by  any  entity who is not a party
to this Agreement (including, but not limited to,  any  Governmental
Authority) (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party,  with
respect to which Parent or the Stockholders ("Indemnifying Party") are 
required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party  shall promptly give written notice together with a statement of any
reasonably  available information regarding such claim to the Indemnifying
Party within  ten  (10) Business Days after learning of such Third Party
Claim (or within such  shorter time as may be necessary to give the
Indemnifying Party a reasonable  opportunity to respond to such claim);
_provided_ ,  that no  failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such
notice shall relieve the  Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify
and defend the Indemnified  Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced thereby.  If a Third Party Claim is being made against a
Parent Indemnified Party, the  Stockholders' Agent shall be given reasonable
access to all books and records in  the possession or under the control of
Parent which the Stockholders' Agent  reasonably determines to be related to
such claim.

 

 

7.5.2  _Defense  by Indemnifying Party_.  Subject  to Section 7.5.3.2,
if  an  Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section  7.5.1 of the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

assertion  of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate  in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent
that it wishes  (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against
whom the Third-Party  Claim is made and the Indemnified Party determines in
good faith that joint  representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails  to  provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of its financial capacity  to defend such Third-Party Claim
and provide indemnification with respect to  such Third-Party Claim), to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with  counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from  the  Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the  defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long  as  it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under 
this Article VII for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with 
respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently 
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such 
Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs incurred to provide any
support  requested by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
have ninety  (90) days after notice is given pursuant to Section 7.5.3.1 of
the Indemnifying  Party's election to assume defense of the Third Party Claim
to change its  decision (and return the defense of the Third Party Claim to
the Indemnified  Party) regarding the defense of the Third Party Claim if and
only if __ the  Indemnifying Party has not done anything to prejudice the
Indemnified Party's  position or prevent the Indemnified Party from taking
over the defense of the  Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a  Third-Party Claim, and provided the Indemnifying Party has
not returned the  defense of a Third Party Claim to the Indemnified Party in
accordance with  the  terms of the immediately preceding sentence, then (i)
such assumption will  conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement
that the claims made  in  that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and
subject to indemnification,  and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such
Third-Party Claims may be effected  by the Indemnifying Party without the
Indemnified Party's Consent unless (A)  there is no finding or admission of
any violation of Law or any violation of  the  rights of any Person; (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that  are  paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party (none of which monetary damages shall  be  paid or
reimbursed from the Indemnity Escrow Amount without Parent's consent,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (C) the 
Indemnified Party shall have no liability (including any continuing
obligation  or restriction) with respect to any compromise or settlement of
such Third-Party  Claims effected without its prior written consent. Further,
any fees of counsel  or other out of pocket expenses (other than amounts paid
to third parties,  with  Parent's prior written consent) incurred by any
Stockholders or the  Stockholders' Agent (either as the Indemnifying Party or
as the Indemnified  Party) may not be reimbursed from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount except to the  limited extent expressly provided in Sections 1.8.

 



 

7.5.3  _Defense  by Indemnified Party_. 

 



 

7.5.3.1  If  an  Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to Section  7.5.1 of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party does  not, within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified
Party's notice is given, give  notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such  Third-Party Claim or if the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Indemnifying  Party changes its decision regarding the defense of the Third
Party Claim within  the ninety (90) day period provided in Section 7.5.2,
then in any such event  the  Indemnified Party shall have the right to
conduct such defense in good faith  at  the expense of the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnifying Party will be bound  by any determination made in
such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or  settlement effected by the
Indemnified Party with the prior written consent  of  Stockholders' Agent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed.

 



 

7.5.3.2  Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 7.5.2, if an Indemnified Party
determines  in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Third-Party Claim  may adversely affect it or any of its Affiliates other
than as a result of  monetary damages for which it would be entitled to
indemnification under this  Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice
to the Indemnifying Party,  assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise
or settle such Third-Party  Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be
bound by any compromise or  settlement of any Third-Party Claim effected
without its prior written consent  (which may not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 



 

7.5.4  _Duty  to Keep Other Party Informed_.  With  respect to any Third-
Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article  VII: (i) both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, as the case  may  be, shall
keep the other Person reasonably informed of the status of such  Third-Party
Claim and any related Litigation at all stages thereof where such  Person is
not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree, at  the 
expense of the party defending the claim, to render to each other such 
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in 
good  faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of  any  Third-Party Claim.

 



 

7.5.5  _Confidentiality_.  With  respect to any Third-Party Claim subject
to indemnification under this Article  VII, the parties agree to cooperate in
such a manner as to preserve in full  (to  the extent possible) the
confidentiality of all confidential information and  the  attorney-client
and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each  party  agrees
that: (i) it will use its best efforts, in respect of any Third-Party  Claim
in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid  production
of confidential information (consistent with applicable law and  rules  of
procedure), and (ii) all communications between any party hereto and counsel 
responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim
shall,  to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client  or work-product privilege.

 



 

7.5.6 _Reimbursement  Payments for Third-Party Claims_.  Any  Adverse
Consequences that Parent or a Parent Indemnified Party suffers that  are 
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII shall be paid. The 
parties shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith to cause the Parent or 
Parent Indemnified Party to be paid, without unreasonable delay, from the 
Indemnity Escrow Amount (which is held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement)
with  respect to any amounts the Parent or Parent Indemnified Party is
entitled to  be  paid in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
Any Adverse  Consequences that a

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Stockholder  Indemnified Party suffers that is subject to indemnification
pursuant to this  Article VII shall be paid as provided in Section 7.8.

 



 

7.6  _Limitation  of Remedies_.

 



 

7.6.1  _Limits  on Indemnity Escrow Amount_.  All  Adverse Consequences
sustained by a Parent Indemnified Party shall be payable  solely from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount except for claims or other matters  relating to (i)
payments due under Section 1.9.4 for Working Capital (which  payments shall
come only from the Working Capital Escrow Amount) or (ii) any  Parent
Limitation Exception. Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in
this Agreement, no Person other than Parent or Parent Indemnified Parties 
shall be entitled to any or all of the Indemnity Escrow Amount except as 
expressly provided in Section 1.8. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate  in every reasonable way to enable Parent Indemnified Parties to
timely recover  from the Indemnity Escrow Amount all amounts for which a
Parent Indemnified  Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article
VII or is otherwise  entitled or to which the Stockholders are bound pursuant
to this Article VII. 

 



 

7.6.2  _Application  of Insurance Proceeds_.  The  parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of  any  insurance
which would have the effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences.  To  the
extent any Adverse Consequence of an Indemnified Party is reduced by receipt 
of payment (i) under insurance policies which are not subject to retroactive 
adjustment or other reimbursement to the insurer in respect of such payment, 
or  (ii) from third parties not affiliated with the Indemnified Party, such
payments  (net of the expenses of the recovery thereof) shall be credited
against any  such  Adverse Consequences, and, if indemnification payments
shall have been received  prior to the collection of such proceeds, the
Indemnified Party shall remit  to  the Indemnifying Party the amount of such
proceeds (net of the cost of  collection thereof) to the extent the
indemnification payments received in  respect of such Adverse Consequences
would otherwise result in a duplicative  recovery to the Indemnified Party.

 



 

7.6.3  _Limitations  on Remedy_.  Except  for claims or other matters
relating to Working Capital, any Stockholders  Limitation Exception, any
Parent Limitation Exception or the Escrow Agreement  or  Escrow Fund Amount
(including asserting rights thereto), the remedies provided  for in this
Article VII (and as limited by this Article VII) shall be the sole  basis for
making a claim for damages against any party to this Agreement with  respect
to matters for which indemnification is available under Section 7.2  or 
Section 7.3. However, neither this limitation nor any other provision of
this  Article VII is intended to or will be construed to limit any party's
ability to  obtain specific performance with respect to any obligation of the
other party  or  parties and each party to this Agreement shall be entitled
to specifically  enforce the obligations of each other party in this
Agreement to the maximum  extent permitted by Law.

 



 

7.6.4  _Duty  to Mitigate_.  The  Parent shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate all Adverse  Consequences sustained or incurred
by the Parent Indemnified Parties, and the  Stockholders' Agent and the
Stockholders shall take all commercially reasonable  steps to

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

mitigate  all Adverse Consequences sustained or incurred by the Stockholder
Indemnified  Parties, upon and after becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably  be  expected to give rise to Adverse Consequences.

 



 

7.7  THIS  SECTION INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.

 



 

7.8  _Payments  to Stockholder Indemnified Party_.  If  a  Stockholder
Indemnified Party has notified Parent in writing of one or more  claims or
potential claims (within the General Survival Period) for which the 
indemnification provisions of Section 7.3 are applicable (each a
"Stockholder  Claim" and collectively, the "Stockholder Claims"), then the
aggregate amount of  Adverse Consequences (whether arising before or after
the notice referenced  in  this sentence) suffered by the Stockholder
Indemnified Party for which the  indemnification provisions of Section 7.3
are applicable (so the Stockholder  Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from Parent thereunder) shall  be paid by Parent without
unreasonable delay to the applicable Stockholder  Indemnified Party, in
accordance with this Agreement (but subject to any  applicable express
limitations in this Article VII). None of the Adverse  Consequences suffered
by any Stockholder Indemnified Party or Stockholders' Agent shall be paid
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 



 

7.9  _Payments  from the Indemnity Escrow Amount_.  If a  Parent
Indemnified Party has notified the Escrow Agent and Stockholders' Agent  in
writing of one or more claims or potential claims (within the applicable 
time  period permitted by Section 7.1) for which the indemnification
provisions of  Section 7.2 are applicable (each a "Parent Claim" and
collectively, the "Parent  Claims"), then the aggregate amount of Adverse
Consequences (whether arising  before or after the notice referenced in this
sentence) for which the Parent  Indemnified Party is or becomes entitled to
indemnification under Section 7.2  shall be paid to the Parent or Parent
Indemnified Party, as applicable, from  the  Indemnity Escrow Amount upon
demand by the Parent Indemnified Party or Parent,  as applicable, in
accordance with this Agreement (but subject to any applicable  express
limitations in this Article VII). The  parties shall direct the Escrow Agent
to pay the Parent or Parent Indemnified  Party, without unreasonable delay,
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount held  pursuant to the Escrow Agreement with
respect to any amounts the Parent or  Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to
be paid in accordance with the  immediately preceding sentence. Such 
payments from the Indemnity Escrow Amount to Parent Indemnified Party or
Parent  shall be permanently retained by the Parent Indemnified Party or
Parent, as  applicable, and the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be deemed to be
reduced  accordingly.

 



 

7.10  _Treatment  of Payments_.  Amounts  paid to or on behalf of a
Stockholder Indemnified Party or a Parent Indemnified  Party as
indemnification shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger  Consideration
unless otherwise required by a change in Law or a final  unappealable
determination.

 



 

7.11  _Cooperation  Relating to German Environmental Issue_.  In the 
event there is any claim by any Governmental Authority against Parent, JJI, 
any  Subsidiary of JJI or any Affiliate of Parent relating to the German 
Environmental Issue,  the  Surviving Company and the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Stockholders'  Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with each other  to  (i) minimize the Adverse Consequences relating to the
German Environmental  Issue  and (ii) cause the Escrow Agent to timely pay
the Adverse Consequences relating  to the German Environmental Issue which
are indemnifiable under this Agreement  from the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 



 

7.12  _INDEMNIFICATION  IN CASE OF STRICT LIABILITY OR INDEMNITEE
NEGLIGENCE_.  **THE  INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE VII SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS  OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT)  ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE  OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY  IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION.**

Expenses before the earlier of the end of the General Survival  Period or the
date the Hoffmeister Family Plan Expenses are paid by JJI or  a  Subsidiary

are able to eliminate all Liabilities relating to the subject  matter of the
Hoffmeister Family Plan Expenses for an amount less than the  amount included
in Pay Off Liabilities pursuant to Section 1.7.1.1.4 then  the  amount of
the net savings to JJI as a result of such resolution (as reasonably 
determined by the Surviving Company) will, without duplication of any other 
benefit to the Stockholders and subject to the limitations referenced below, 
(i)  be included in Working Capital to the extent such Liabilities are
eliminated  before delivery by Parent of the Post-Closing Statement or (ii)
be paid by  JJI  or a Subsidiary of JJI to the Escrow Agent (and such amount
shall become  part of  the Indemnity Escrow Amount); provided,  however,

Merger  dated  as of May 12, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement");

 



 

WHEREAS,  the parties hereto desire to make certain changes in the Merger
Agreement  as  stated herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS,  except to the extent expressly changed herein, the Merger Agreement
shall  continue to be in full force and effect and shall be deemed to have
been  entered  into as of May 12, 2006.

 



 

W  I T N E  S S E T H:

 



 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the promises and
covenants  herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

1. Addendum.  Except  as expressly modified by numerical paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Addendum,  the  Merger Agreement is hereby ratified and shall continue in full force and  effect  in accordance with its terms. The Merger Agreement, as modified by this  Addendum, shall be deemed to have been entered into as of May 12, 2006. Each  party represents to the other that (i) it has obtained all necessary approval  and consent to modify the Merger Agreement as set forth herein, including,  without limitation, any approval required by its directors or officers and  (ii)  all representations in the Merger Agreement made by such party apply to this  Addendum as though its terms were a part of the Merger Agreement at the time  of  the execution of the Merger Agreement. The definitions and other provisions  of  Article VIII of the Merger Agreement apply to the interpretation of this  Addendum.

 



 

2. Modifications  to Merger Agreement.

 



 

(a) Section  1.4.1 Merger  Sub Stock  is  hereby modified by deleting
subparagraph (i) in its entirety and replacing  it  with the following:

 



 

(i)  each  share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become Eleven Thousand
(11,000)  shares of Class A common stock of the Surviving Company with the
same rights,  powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall

(b) Section  1.5.3 Stock  of  Merger Sub is  hereby  modified by deleting
it in its entirety and replacing it with the  following:

 



 

Each  share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become Eleven Thousand
(11,000)  shares of Class A common stock of the Surviving Company as provided
in Section  1.4.1.(i).

 



 

(c) Section  1.4.6.1 Exchange  Agent  is  hereby modified by deleting the
first sentence in its entirety and replacing  it  with the following two
sentences:

 



 

Prior  to  the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the  purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for
certificates representing  shares of Class A Common Stock, and Parent agrees
to act as an exchange agent  for the purpose of exchanging the Merger
Consideration for certificates  representing JJI Preferred Stock and for
certificates representing Class  B  Common Stock Warrants (collectively, all
certificates representing shares  of JJI  Stock and certificates
representing Class B Common Stock Warrants are the  "Certificates"). All
references in the Merger Agreement to Exchange Agent shall  be deemed to
refer to the Exchange Agent when used in connection with  certificates
representing shares of Class A Common Stock and shall be deemed  to  refer
to Parent when used in connection with certificates representing shares  of 
JJI Preferred Stock and certificates representing Class B Common Stock
Warrants. 

 



 

(d) Section  1.4.6.3 Letter  of  Transmittal  is  hereby modified by
deleting the second and third sentences in their entirety  and  replacing
them with the following:

 



 

The  Exchange Agent or Parent shall provide letters of transmittal along
with  instructions for use in exchange (together, the "Letter of
Transmittal") as  follows: (a) a letter of transmittal in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit  C-1  to  Stockholders' Agent at or as soon as reasonably
practical following the Closing  and (b) a letter of transmittal in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit  C-2 to  the  holders of Class A Common Stock
(at the address provided by JJI pursuant  to this  Section 1.4.6.3) at or as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing.  If Parent desires to
modify the Letter of Transmittal attached hereto as  Exhibit  C-2, then
Parent may send Stockholders' Agent written notice of Parent's  proposed
modifications and Stockholders' Agent shall have five (5) Business Days 
after such notice has been received by Stockholders' Agent in which to object
to  the notice.

 



 

(e) Section  1.4.6.4 Surrender  of Certificates  is  hereby modified by
inserting the word "appropriate" before the phrase "Letter of  Transmittal"
that appears once in the first sentence and once in the second  sentence of
Section 1.4.6.4.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) Section  1.4.6.10 Lost  Certificates  is  hereby modified by inserting

(g) Section  1.7.1.1 "Pay Off Liabilities" is hereby modified by adding the
following  grammatical paragraph at the end of Section 1.7.1.1:

 



 

To  the  extent the aggregate amount of the amounts included in the Pay Off
Liabilities  to pay off the Senior Debt Payments, the Hoffmeister Debt
Payments and the  Transaction Expenses (i) is greater than the actual
aggregate amount required  to  pay off the Senior Debt Payments, the
Hoffmeister Debt Payments and the  Transaction Expenses, then such excess
amount (to the extent not otherwise  taken  into account in establishing
Working Capital) shall be added to Working Capital  and thereby increase the
Final Working Capital or (ii) is less than the  aggregate amount required to
fully pay off the Senior Debt Payments, the  Hoffmeister Debt Payments and
the Transaction Expenses, then such deficiency  (to  the extent not
otherwise taken into account in establishing Working Capital)  shall be
subtracted from Working Capital and thereby decrease the Final Working 
Capital. Provided, further, to the extent there are taxes, employer's share
of  FICA, Medicare or other amounts which are or may become payable to any 
Governmental Authority in connection with the Change of Control Obligations, 
SERP Funding or Contract Termination Expenses, such amounts (to the extent 
not  otherwise taken into account in establishing Working Capital) shall be 
subtracted from Working Capital and thereby decrease the Final Working
Capital.  The parties acknowledge that the definition of "Working Capital"
shall be deemed  to be modified hereby to give full effect to the provisions
of this grammatical  paragraph.

 

 

(h) The  list  of Exhibits that appears on the Signature Page is hereby
modified by deleting  "Exhibit C - Letter of Transmittal" and replacing it
with the  following:

Document and when  taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the
same agreement.  The  exchange of copies of the Merger Agreement, this
Addendum and any other  Transaction Documents and of signature pages by
facsimile or electronic  transmission shall constitute effective execution
and delivery of the Merger  Agreement, this Addendum and any other
Transaction Documents as to the parties  and may be used in lieu of the
original Merger Agreement, this Addendum and  any  other Transaction
Documents for all purposes. Signatures of


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the  parties transmitted by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be
deemed  to  be their original signatures for all purposes.

 



 

(j)  The  definition of "Agreement" in Article VIII is hereby modified by
changing the  definition to provide as follows: 

 

 

"Agreement"  has the meaning set forth in the introduction but the term

the Schedules, the  Exhibits, any certificates delivered pursuant to the
"Agreement" and any other  addendum or modification to the "Agreement".

Merger.

 



 

(l) The  definition of "Transaction Expenses" in Article VIII is hereby

6. The  first  year fee of $3,500 owed to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(m) Section  7.6.3 Limits  on  Indemnity Escrow Amount  is  hereby
modified by deleting the last sentence at the end of the grammatical 
paragraph and replacing it with the following sentence:

 



 

However,  neither this limitation nor any other provision of this Article VII
is intended  to or will be construed to limit (i) any party\'s ability to
obtain specific  performance with respect to any obligation of the other
party or parties  and  each party to this Agreement shall be entitled to
specifically enforce the  obligations of each other party in this Agreement
to the maximum extent  permitted by Law, or (ii) remedies under any agreement
delivered pursuant  to  Article V or any agreement otherwise agreed to by
the parties.

 



 

(n) The  parties have agreed that for purposes of establishing the amount of
any Pay  Off  Liabilities which are expressed in Euros and for purposes of
establishing  the  amount of the Hoffmeister Personnel Severance Costs the
parties will base  the  calculation of the amount to be used in determining
Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 1.7.1 of the Merger Agreement on
the assumption that  1.00  Euro is equal to $1.2780.

 



 

(o)  Section  7.2.8 is hereby modified by deleting this section in its
entirety and  substituting the following therefore:

 



 

7.2.8  Any  Terminated Contract or any Warrant issued, incurred or agreed to

(p) Subparagraph  (vi) in the definition of "Parent Limitation Exception" in
Article VIII is  hereby modified by adding the following parenthetical after
the phrase "or other  right in JJI or its equity":

 



 

(including  any claim of any type relating to the Warrants held by the
Patricia K Incrocci  Trust, the Estate of Harry J. Keenan and Jesse Keenan)

 



 

(q) Sections  1.7.1.4, 4.18 and paragraph (c) of Exhibit D are each hereby
modified by  replacing each "$32,000,000" with "$33,000,000" .

 



 

3. Modifications  to Exhibits to Merger Agreement.

 



 

(a)  The  attachment to the Merger Agreement referred to as "Exhibit A -
Certificate of  Merger" is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with a
Certificate of  Merger substantially in the form attached to this Addendum as
Exhibit  A. 

 



 

(b)  The  attachment to the Merger Agreement referred to as "Exhibit C -
Letter of  Transmittal" is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with
the following:  a letter of transmittal for Stockholders' Agent in the form
attached to this  Addendum as Exhibit  C-1  and a  letter of transmittal
for the holders of Class A Common Stock in the form  attached to this
Addendum as Exhibit  C-2. 

 



 

(c)  The  attachment to the Merger Agreement referred to as "Exhibit F -
Escrow Agreement" is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with an
escrow agreement  substantially in the form attached to this Addendum as
Exhibit  F. 

 



 

(d) The  attachment to the Merger Agreement referred to as "Exhibit H -List
of Schedules  prepared by JJI" is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced
with a the list  of schedules substantially in the form attached to this
Addendum as Exhibit  H. 

 

 

(e) Exhibit  D  to the Merger Agreement is hereby modified by adding the
following additional  paragraphs (k) and (l):

 



 

(k)  Puenta  Valley Site.  Subject  to the limitation in paragraph (c) of
Exhibit D, Working Capital shall be  increased by an amount (not to exceed
$30,000) equal to the amount JJI receives  from the former owners of Troy
Lighting, Inc. relating to the Puenta Valley  Site  to the extent such
amount is received after the Closing and before delivery  of  the Post-
Closing Statement by Parent and is not otherwise taken into account  in 
determining Working Capital or reducing the Puente Valley Site Estimated 
Costs.

 



 

(l) Late  Receipt of Wires for Certain Pay Off Liabilities.  If any  one or
more of the wires intended to pay off any Pay Off Liabilities is not 
credited as being received by the applicable recipient early enough to give 
credit on the Effective Date and provided that Parent used  commercially


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 


 

reasonable  efforts to cause the correct amount of money to be wired to the
intended  recipient in a reasonably timely manner, then Working Capital shall
be reduced  by the amount of any expenses or additional interest required to
pay off  each  Pay Off Liability arising from the failure of such Pay Off
Liabilities receiving  payoff credit on the Effective Date.

 



 

(m) Hoffmeister  Lease Support.  The  calculation pursuant to Section
1.7.1.2.1 would result in a calculation of  Hoffmeister Lease Support of
$1,613,699; however, the parties agree that  since  the intention was to
provide for support at the rate of $1,000,000 per year  for  the balance of
the Hoffmeister lease, and since JJI has paid the rent through  the month of
May and hence already paid $25,000 of the support payments prior  to  the
Effective Time, that the amount to which Genlyte is entitled pursuant  to 
this provision is $1,558,333 (which is 1 year and 7 months at $83,333.33 
per  month less the $25,000 prepaid amount) and that this amount of
$1,558,333  shall  be used as a deduction for purposes of determining Merger
Consideration and  further agree that no amount will be included in Working
Capital as prepaid  rent  or for the $25,000 prepaid amount for this matter.

 



 

4. Modifications  to Schedules to Merger Agreement.

 



 

       (a)  |  

  Schedule 2.14.6 attached to this Addendum is hereby added to the 
Schedules.

    
---|--- 
    

 



 

(b) Schedule  2.32.5 to the Merger Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and the  Schedule 2.32.5 attached to this Addendum is substituted
therefore.

 



 

5. Documents  Executed on or after the Date of this Addendum.  Any  other  document, instrument or certificate that is executed on or after the date  of  this Addendum and that refers to the Merger Agreement will be deemed to refer  to  the Merger Agreement as amended by this Addendum, without regard to whether  such  document, instrument or certificate expressly refers to this  Addendum.
