MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned indirect
Subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"), and NORTH AMERICAN GALVANIZING and

used in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
Section 8.3 or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.

 



 

R E C I T A L S

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
have approved this Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by Parent
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Purchaser proposes to commence a
tender offer to purchase all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.10
per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") that are outstanding
(the "Shares"), at a price per Share of $7.50 (such amount or any higher
amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, the "Offer Price")
payable net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any
withholding Taxes required by applicable Law (such offer, as amended from
time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer"); and

 



 

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the "Merger"), in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"),
whereby each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares to be
cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously
(i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the Company's stockholders accept the
Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser in the Offer and adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation"); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Purchaser has, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including without limitation the Offer and the Merger, and the Parent
(in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Arbor-Crowley, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Holding Company"), which is the sole stockholder of Purchaser)
has adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger; and


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer
and the Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition to Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have entered into a Stockholders' Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof, the form of which is attached as Exhibit A
hereto (the "Stockholders' Agreement"), with the stockholders named therein
(the "Stockholders"), pursuant to which each Stockholder has, among other
things, (1) agreed to tender all Shares owned by such Stockholder pursuant to
the Offer, (2) granted to Parent an option to purchase all of the Shares
owned by such Stockholder, and (3) agreed to vote all Shares beneficially
owned by such Stockholder in favor of the Merger and this Agreement and
against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein), in each case subject to
and on the conditions set forth therein.

 



 

AGREEMENT

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to
this Agreement agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1 Offer.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, and none of the events or conditions listed in clause (c)
of Annex I hereto ("Annex I") shall have occurred and be continuing,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"))
the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Go-Shop Period
Termination Date, but no later than five (5) Business Days thereafter (or
such other date as the parties may mutually agree in writing).

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(b) Subject to (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares that, together
with (x) the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by Parent
or Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise has,
directly or indirectly, sole voting power, and (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that are issuable upon exercise of Options, that are
held in trust pursuant to the Company\'s Director Stock Unit Program or that
constitute restricted shares, in each case whose holders have executed the
Stockholders' Agreement, represents at least two-thirds (⅔) of all
outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis and inclusive of
those Shares tendered pursuant to the Stockholders' Agreement) entitled to
vote (A) in the election of directors, (B) upon the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger, and (C) upon an amendment of the
Company's Charter, on the date Shares are accepted for payment (collectively,
the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or
Purchaser of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as promptly as practicable after Purchaser is legally permitted to
do so under applicable Law (the date and time of acceptance for payment, the
"Acceptance Time"). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser
on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any and all Shares
that Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant
to the Offer. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net
to the holder of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section
2.2(e).

 

 



 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance
with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions
and requirements set forth in Annex I. Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve
the right to increase the Offer Price, waive any condition to the Offer
(except the Minimum Condition) or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that, unless previously approved
by the Company in writing, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price
payable in the Offer, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the
Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend or modify
the other conditions set forth in Annex I in a manner adverse to the holders
of Shares, (vi) extend the Expiration Date other than in accordance with
this Agreement, or (vii) amend any other term of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares.

 



 

(d) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, unless extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 5:00
p.m. (Central Daylight Saving Time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business
Days following the commencement of the Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date")
or, if the Offer has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, at the
time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Date, or such later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the "Expiration Date").

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(e) If, on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the
conditions of the Offer is not satisfied or waived, Purchaser may (without
the consent of the Company) extend the Offer for one or more additional
periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days with such length as Purchaser
determines consistent with applicable Law, provided that each such extension
shall be for not more than ten (10) Business Days if all of the conditions
set forth on Annex I other than the Minimum Condition have been satisfied or
waived at such then scheduled Expiration Date. If, on or prior to any then
scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition is not satisfied, Purchaser
shall (to the extent requested in writing by the Company) extend the Offer
for up to two periods of not less than ten (10) Business Days each and up to
twenty (20) Business Days each with such lengths as Purchaser determines
consistent with applicable Law. In addition, Purchaser shall extend the then
scheduled Expiration Date for any period or periods required by applicable
Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or its staff or NASDAQ.

 

 



 

(f) If the Minimum Condition has been satisfied but the number of Shares that
have been accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer (after giving effect to
any proper withdrawal of Shares prior to the Expiration Date but without
giving effect to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option),
together with (x) the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by
Parent or Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise
has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power, and (y) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon exercise of Options, that are
held in trust pursuant to the Company\'s Director Stock Unit Program or that
constitute restricted shares, in each case whose holders have executed the
Stockholders' Agreement, represents less than eighty percent (80%) of all
outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis), Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or
more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, immediately accept for
payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the
Offer during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents shall
provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner
consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f).

 



 

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article VII, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
such termination) terminate the Offer and shall not acquire Shares pursuant
thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Purchaser
to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof.

 



 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in compliance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits: the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, the notice of guaranteed delivery,
a form of summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and
instruments required by the Exchange Act pursuant to which the Offer shall be
made (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Offer Documents"). Parent and Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by such party
for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and Parent and Purchaser agree to cause the
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to
the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and
Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel. In the event that Parent and Purchaser receive any comments from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents, they
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond promptly

practicable thereafter, the Company shall, in compliance with Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.4(d),
contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by such party for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed
with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In the
event that the Company receives any comments from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond promptly to such comments.

(b) Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event in sufficient time to
permit Purchaser to commence the Offer in a timely manner) and otherwise from
time to time as requested by Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security
position listings, non-objecting Beneficial Owner lists and any other
listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record
or Beneficial Owners of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date and
such other assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating with the record and Beneficial Owners of Shares, in connection
with the preparation and dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer

Section 1.3 Directors.

 



 

(a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of such
number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and from time to
time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as shall
give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the product of
(i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect
to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and
(ii) the percentage that such number of Shares so purchased (including Shares
accepted for payment and the purchased Top-Up Shares) bears to the total
number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request by
Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use its
reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such number
of directors as is necessary to provide Purchaser with such level of
representation and shall cause Purchaser's designees to be so elected or
appointed; provided, however, that Parent shall be entitled to designate at
least a majority of the directors on the Company Board (as long as Parent and
its Affiliates Beneficially Own a majority of the Shares of the Company). The
Company will use its best efforts to cause each committee of the Company
Board and the Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of the Company to include
persons designated by Purchaser constituting at least the same percentage of
each such committee and the Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company as Purchaser's designees are of the Company Board. The Company's
obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. At
the request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 necessary to effect any such
election or appointment of Purchaser's designees in accordance with this
Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its stockholders the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder, which, unless Purchaser otherwise elects, shall be so
mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser shall supply to
the Company all information with respect to themselves and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1.

 



 

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchaser's designees pursuant
to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
the Company Board to maintain at least two (2) directors who are members of
the Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of
the Company and who are independent directors for purposes of the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ
(the "Continuing Directors"); provided, however, that if the number of
Continuing Directors is reduced below two (2) for any reason, the remaining
Continuing Director shall immediately elect or designate one person meeting
the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be
a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement such that, following
such election or designation, there shall be two (2) Continuing Directors or,
if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate
two (2) persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall promptly take all action
as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under this Section
1.3(b). So long as there shall be at least one (1) Continuing Director, (i)
any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action by the
Company Board, (ii) any extension of time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, (iii)
any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions under this
Agreement that are to the benefit of the Company, or (iv) any exercise of the
Company's rights or remedies under this Agreement shall require the
concurrence of both of the Continuing Directors (or of the sole Continuing
Director if there shall then be only one Continuing Director).

together with (x) the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by
Parent or Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise

Merger Meeting Procedures) is required under applicable Law to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly

Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement promptly after the Company's receipt of such comments, and
any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses
and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel.

 

 



 

(b) If, after the Acceptance Time, approval of the stockholders of the
Company is required under applicable Law to consummate the Merger (other than

the Company Board, shall, in accordance with and subject to the requirements
of applicable Law: (i) as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time,
in consultation with Parent, duly set a record date for, and within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of SEC clearance of the Proxy Statement, call and

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise
has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger and to deliver or provide, in its
capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other approvals that are
required by applicable Law to effect the Merger. Section 1.6(a)-(c) are
collectively referred to herein as the "Merger Meeting Procedures".

any proper withdrawal of Shares prior to the Expiration Date but without
giving effect to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option),
together with (x) the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by
Parent or Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise

constitute restricted shares, in each case whose holders have executed the
Stockholders' Agreement, represents at least eighty percent (80%) but less
than ninety percent (90%) of all outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully
Diluted Basis), at Parent's option, either (i) the Merger Meeting Procedures
will be followed, or (ii) the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC as
promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time an information
statement for a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
considering and approving an amendment to the Company Charter to allow for
the Merger to be consummated without a meeting of stockholders of the Company
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. Once such amendment is approved,
(1) Purchaser shall exercise the Top-Up Option (described in Section 1.7
below), (2) a Certificate of Amendment setting forth such amendment to the
Company's Charter will be filed by the Company with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware as soon as possible after the stockholders' meeting
described in the immediately preceding clause (ii) and (3) Purchaser and the
Company shall effect the short-form Merger pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL immediately after the filing of such Certificate of Amendment with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

 



 

(e) If the Minimum Condition has been satisfied but the number of Shares that
have been accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer (after giving effect to
any proper withdrawal of Shares prior to the Expiration Date but without
giving effect to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option),
together with (x) the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by
Parent or Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise
has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power, and (y) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon exercise of Options, that are
held in trust pursuant to the Company\'s Director Stock Unit Program or that
constitute restricted shares, in each case whose holders have executed the
Stockholders' Agreement, represents at least ninety percent (90%) of
all outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis), Parent will
have the same option and the parties will follow the procedures described in
Section 1.6(d) above except that Purchaser will not exercise the Top-Up
Option as otherwise described in Section 1.6(d).

Section 1.7 Top-Up Option.

 



 

(a) Subject to the number of Shares that have been accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer (after giving effect to any proper withdrawal of Shares
prior to the Expiration Date but without giving effect to Shares issuable
upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option), together with (x) the number of
Shares, if any, then owned of record by Parent or Purchaser or with respect
to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole
voting power, and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are
issuable upon exercise of Options, that are held in trust pursuant to the
Company\'s Director Stock Unit Program or that constitute restricted shares,
in each case whose holders have executed the Stockholders' Agreement,
representing at least eighty percent (80%) but less than ninety percent (90%)
of all outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis), the Company
hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"),
exercisable once upon the terms and subject to the other conditions set forth
herein, to purchase at the Offer Price an aggregate number of Shares (the
"Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the
number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates at the time
of such exercise and the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are
issuable upon exercise of Options, that are held in trust pursuant to the
Company\'s Director Stock Unit Program or that constitute restricted shares,
in each case whose holders have executed the Stockholders' Agreement, shall
constitute one Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) issued and outstanding,
determined on a Fully Diluted Basis (the "Short Form Threshold"); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number
of Shares in excess of the number of authorized but unissued Shares as of
immediately prior to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares; provided, further,
that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier of: (x) the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the later of (1) the Expiration Date and (2) the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" as described in Section 1.1(f)
above and (y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of
any applicable Law and no judgment, injunction, Order or decree shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Shares in respect of such exercise, (ii) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option,
the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates will
constitute one (1) Share more than the Short Form Threshold, and (iii)
Purchaser has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer
and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date. The parties shall
cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished
consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental
Entities, including any requirements regarding the availability of an
applicable exemption from registration of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares
under the Securities Act.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall send to the Company a
written notice (a "Top-Up Exercise Notice") specifying (i) the number of
Shares that shall be owned by Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates
immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and (ii) the place,
time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale of the Top-Up Shares
(the "Top-Up Closing"). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-
Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Purchaser confirming the
number of Top-Up Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the "Top-
Up Notice Receipt"). At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company,
in the manner set forth in Section 1.7(d) hereof, the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares, in an aggregate principal amount
equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall
cause to be issued and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Shares or, at Purchaser's request or otherwise if the
Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of
Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends that are required by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Purchaser may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or, at Purchaser's election, by
(ii) (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par
value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate price
required to be paid for the purchase of the Top-Up Shares less the amount to
be paid in cash pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (x) (a
"Promissory Note"). Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against
Parent and Purchaser and (1) shall bear interest at a market rate of interest
per annum, payable in arrears at the end of one (1) year, (2) shall mature on
the first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
Promissory Note and (3) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium
or penalty.

 



 

(e) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares shall not be
registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an
exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Purchaser agrees
that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Purchaser for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Purchaser:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or
converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject
to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
Section 2.2(e), upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, surrender of such Book-Entry
Shares) in accordance with Section 2.2.

 



 

(b) Cancellation or Conversion of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company and all Shares owned of
record by Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment
being made with respect thereto. At the Effective Time, all Shares, if any,
held by each Subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding and shall
become that number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation as the number of Shares held by
such Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Purchaser Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Purchaser Common Stock") shall be converted into and become one
newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

 



 

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
reputable national bank reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement. Such funds shall be invested or otherwise
held by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to such holders of the Shares; provided, however, in the
event that such funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are insufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure that the
Paying Agent has funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration.
Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent, and no part of any such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Shares.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(b) Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the "Certificates") or
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), in
each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a
letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of such a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of such payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, other than any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing Shares to be cancelled or
converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) or Dissenting Shares, shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement,
without interest thereon.

 

 



 

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any time
following the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto or any
earnings with respect to the investment thereof) made available to the Paying
Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of their Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with Section 2.2(e). If, prior to six (6) years after the
Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any
payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws), any holder of Shares has not complied with the procedures in
Section 2.2(b) to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Shares
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Withholding Rights. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Option Cash Payment or
Warrant Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Options or Warrants, as applicable, such amounts that Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any other provision
of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and remitted to the
relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Options or
Warrants, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof;
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder of such Shares fails to perfect
or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his or her right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Shares shall cease
to be considered Dissenting Shares hereunder, the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such Shares shall cease and such Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.2(e). The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to
be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and to control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 Treatment of Options. The Company shall take all action
necessary so that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to
purchase Shares (an "Option") granted under the Company's 2004 Incentive
Stock Plan (the "2004 Plan") or 2009 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2009 Plan")
that, in each case, is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) shall be converted into the right of the holder
to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such unexercised portion of such
Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share set forth in such Option, less any
required withholding taxes (the "Option Cash Payment") and as of the
Effective Time shall cease to represent an option to purchase Shares, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each
holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the Option Cash Payment, as calculated pursuant
to this Section 2.4, with respect to any Option would be a negative amount,
such Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without conferring
any right to receive the Option Cash Payment.

 



 

Section 2.5 Treatment of Warrants. At the Acceptance Time, each warrant to
purchase Shares that is issued, unexpired and unexercised immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time (the "Warrants") shall be converted into the right of
the holder thereof to receive, upon exercise at any time after the Acceptance
Time, a payment from Parent or Purchaser in cash of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Warrant
and (ii) the amount in cash of the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over
the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Warrant (such amounts
payable hereunder being referred to as the "Warrant Payments") (less any
applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with Section 2.2(e)). From and after the Acceptance
Time, any Warrant shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof
for Shares, but shall only entitle such holder upon exercise after the
Acceptance Time to the payment, if any, of the Warrant Payment.

liability for either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or

compensation or any other similar termination payment, or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of or otherwise enhance
any benefit due any such employee, officer or director. No amounts payable

access, at reasonable times and upon prior written notice, to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company

Parent and Purchaser such reasonable access to stock transfer records and
other information related to the ownership of capital stock of the Company,
including access to the Company's transfer agent, as Parent may reasonably
request in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any such access,
investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries; (ii) such access will not require the Company to permit any
access, or to permit disclosure of any information, that in its reasonable
judgment would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets, (iii) Parent,
Purchaser and the Parent Representatives will not speak to any of the
personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written

will be made in the presence of a representative of the Company, (iv) such
access will be scheduled at such times and places as shall be determined by
the Company, and (v) Parent, Purchaser and the Parent Representatives shall
not have any such access for purposes of conducting any environmental
assessments, sampling or testing. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would contravene any Law. No investigation conducted
pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify
or limit any representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement.

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a),
Parent shall comply with, and shall cause the Parent Representatives to
comply with, all of its obligations under the Nondisclosure Agreement, the
confidentiality provisions of which shall survive and be binding upon the

contrary contained therein.

 



 

Section 5.4 Solicitation.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, during
the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59
p.m., Central Daylight Saving Time, on the date that is thirty (30) days
after the date of this Agreement (the "Go-Shop Period Termination Date"), the
Company and the Company Representatives shall have the right, under the
direction of the Company Board or any committee thereof, to directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of Acquisition
Proposals from one or more Persons, including by way of contacting third
parties or public disclosure, and providing access to non-public information
pursuant to the prior execution of a Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement
with any such Person; provided, that the Company shall promptly provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its representatives that
was not previously provided to Parent; and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding, and take any other action to facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Subject to Sections 5.4(c) and 5.4(d), from the Go-Shop Period
Termination Date until the earlier of the Acceptance Time or the date this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly take any action to
facilitate or encourage (including by way of providing information) the
submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or
attempts that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw (or change, amend, modify
or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or propose publicly
to withdraw (or change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser), or otherwise make any statement or
proposal inconsistent with, the Company Board Recommendation (any action or
failure to act set forth in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), a "Change of
Board Recommendation"), or (iv) enter into any merger agreement, letter of
intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
Contract or agreement in principle that is intended or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations
hereunder or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject
to Section 5.4(c), on the Go-Shop Period Termination Date, the Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities that would
otherwise be a violation of this Section 5.4(b) conducted theretofore by the
Company or the Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. Subject to Section 5.4(c), with respect to parties with whom
discussions or negotiations have been terminated on or prior to the Go-Shop
Period Termination Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to require such parties to promptly return or destroy in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement any
non-public information previously furnished by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(b), following the Go-Shop Period
Termination Date, the Company and the Company Representatives may continue
discussions and negotiations with, and provide information to, any Person,
group of related Persons or group that (1) includes any Person with whom the
Company is having ongoing discussions or negotiations prior to the Go-Shop
Period Termination Date regarding a possible Acquisition Proposal and (2) has
been identified in writing to Parent (any such Person or group, a "Go-Shop
Party") if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) that
such Person has made or could reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition
Proposal that after further discussions or negotiations could reasonably
result in a Superior Proposal.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(b), if at any time following the Go-Shop
Period Termination Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal,
which is not solicited, facilitated or encouraged willfully or in bad faith
in breach of Section 5.4(b) above, from any other third party that is not a
Go-Shop Party, and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, and (B) the failure to take the actions referred to in
clause (x) or (y) of this sentence could reasonably be expected to be a
breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish non-
public information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, provided,
that (1) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company shall have
received from such Person a Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement and (2) all
such information shall previously have been provided to Parent and Purchaser
or is provided to Parent and Purchaser prior to or substantially
contemporaneously with the time it is provided to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or such Person's representatives and (y) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal. At any time following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within forty-eight (48) hours), advise Parent orally and in writing
of the receipt from any Person of (1) any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms of such proposal and (2) any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a
potential Acquisition Proposal, or for access to the properties, books or
records of the Company by any Person that informs the Company that is it
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, in each
case, including the identity of the Person(s) making such proposal, inquiry
or request, and, if applicable, providing copies of any documents or
correspondence evidencing such proposal or inquiry. The Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status and any material developments, discussions and negotiations
concerning such Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions
thereof, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or
correspondence relating thereto that is exchanged between the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (or its representatives) and the Company (or the
Company Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will
promptly (within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent orally and in writing
if it determines to begin providing information to, or to engage in
negotiations with, any Person other than a Go-Shop Party concerning
an Acquisition Proposal.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(b), if
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that are offered by Parent (including pursuant to clause (2)
below), the Company Board may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (i)
effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the immediately
foregoing clause (ii) unless, concurrently with or prior to such termination,
the Company pays the Breakup Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions
of Section 7.1(e) and Section 7.3; and provided, further that the Company
Board may not effect a change of Company Board Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) unless (A) the Company
shall not have breached willfully or in bad faith this Section 5.4
with respect to such Superior Proposal, (B) the Company Board shall have
taken into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation, and (C):

 



 

(1) the Company shall have provided written notice to Parent ("Notice of
Adverse Recommendation") at least five (5) days in advance (the "Notice
Period") of its intention, absent any amendment to terms and conditions of
this Agreement as described in the immediately following clause (2), to take
such actions described in the immediately foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal), shall specifically identify the terms
of such Superior Proposal that causes such Acquisition Proposal to constitute
a Superior Proposal, and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior
Proposal and other material documents, including the proposed definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and a new notice period, which shall be five (5) days in
advance of the Company Board's intention to take action pursuant to this
Section 5.4(d)); and


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

(2) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, (x) provide Parent and
Purchaser during the Notice Period with an opportunity to amend the terms and
conditions contained in this Agreement in a manner such that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal as a result thereof,
in which event the Company shall, and shall cause its outside counsel and
financial advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable Parent and Purchaser to proceed
with the transactions contemplated hereby, as so amended, and (y)
permit Parent to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Parent
desires to make such presentation).

 



 

(e) The Company agrees that any willful and material violations of the
restrictions set forth in Sections 5.4(b) or 5.4(c) by any Company
Representative shall be deemed to be a breach of Sections 5.4(b) or 5.4(c),
as the case may be, by the Company.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not release any third
party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or "standstill"
or similar agreement in favor of the Company.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board
from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its
stockholders in favor of the Offer shall be deemed to be a Change of Board
Recommendation.

 



 

(h) None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company
Board shall enter into any binding agreement with any Person to limit or not
to give prior notice to Parent or Purchaser of its intention to effect a
Change of Board Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in light of a
Superior Proposal.

 



 

Section 5.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with one another
(A) in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should

waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to
Contracts or instruments material to the Company's business in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any consents,

making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any
Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith
the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding (but giving
the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting) and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. The parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable. The Company and Parent will
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable all consents, approvals and waivers required by third
persons so that all Company Permits and Contracts of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will remain in full force and effect after the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 5.6 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, each party hereto shall
promptly notify the other party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b)
any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, that has become untrue or inaccurate or the failure of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement required to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.6 shall not alone cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)  For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable provisions of the DGCL, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and all fiduciaries under any of the Plans (the
"Indemnified Persons") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the Subsidiaries
Governance Documents and the indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date of this Agreement and set forth in Schedule 5.16(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Indemnification Agreements")
for acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any Subsidiary or as fiduciaries under any of the Plans
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 5.16(a) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the Subsidiaries Governance Documents
and the Indemnification Agreements; provided, however, that the Indemnified
Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced
expenses to the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to such reimbursement obligation
pursuant to this Section 5.16(a). 


 

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective
Time, who are covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy maintained by the Company (the "Insured Persons"), an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for actions or omissions of
such Indemnified Persons prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
such (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's existing
insurance policy (true and complete copies of which have been previously
provided to Parent) ("Equivalent Coverage") with the Company's current
provider of such insurance or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage
is unavailable from such provider, the best available coverage from a carrier
with the same or better credit rating (a "Comparable Carrier"); provided,
however, that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.16(b),
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%)
(the "Maximum Amount") of the last annual premium paid by the Company with
respect to such existing policy prior to the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, after prior consultation with
Parent, purchase six (6) year "tail" prepaid policies prior to the Effective
Time for the benefit of the Insured Persons, which policies are obtained from
a Comparable Carrier and provide such Insured Persons with Equivalent
Coverage; provided, that the amount paid by the Company with respect to such
prepaid policies shall not be in excess of the Maximum Amount of the per
annum premium rate paid by the Company as of the date hereof for its existing
insurance policy. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.16(b) shall be deemed to
have been satisfied and Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.16.

 



 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.16 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under
all Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.16 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.16, and this Section 5.16
shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors, heirs and legal representatives and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

 

Section 5.17   Continuation of Employee Benefits. At the Effective Date,
Purchaser shall permit all employees of the Company (the "New Purchaser
Employees") to participate in Purchaser's 401(k) plan pursuant to the terms
thereof and, in connection therewith, shall credit each New Purchaser
Employee with the number of days such New Purchaser Employee was employed by
the Company for purposes of any length of service requirements under such
401(k) plan. To the extent allowable under Purchaser's policies and
procedures, Purchaser shall provide each New Purchaser Employee with credit
for years of service prior to the Closing with the Company for (i) the
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accrual) under
Purchaser's health, short-term disability, long-term disability and vacation
programs and policies and (ii) any and all pre-existing condition limitations
and eligibility waiting periods under group health plans of Purchaser, and
shall cause to be credited to any deductible or out-of-pocket expenses (which
are applicable in the plan year of Purchaser in which the Closing Date falls)
under any health plans of Purchaser any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by New Purchaser Employee and their beneficiaries and dependents
under health plans of the Company during the plan year of the Company in
which the Closing Date falls. Nothing herein expressed or implied shall
confer upon any New Purchaser Employee or other employee or former employee
of the Company or legal representatives thereof, any rights or remedies,
including without limitation any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, or any right to
specific terms or conditions of employment (including rate of pay, fringe
benefits or position), under or by reason of this Agreement. The employment
of any New Purchaser Employee or all New Purchaser Employees may be
terminated by Purchaser for any reason or for no reason at any time after the
Closing Date (subject to the payment of any vested benefits accrued under any
employee benefit plan of the Company prior to the Closing and to the payment
of any severance benefit (to the extent that such benefit is under a
Contract, plan or policy in effect on the date of this Agreement or is
specifically agreed to by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation on the one
hand and a New Purchaser Employee on the other hand) payable with respect to
such termination). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or of
Section 8.8 below, this Section 5.17 shall be enforceable solely by the

Section 7.4 Amendment. Subject to Section 1.3(b), this Agreement may be
amended by the Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval of the Merger by the
Company's stockholders, no amendment may be made that, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval by such stockholders without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

Section 8.4 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.5 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
Order or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

Section 8.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Company Disclosure Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto) and the Nondisclosure Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Section 8.7 Assignment. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, provided that Parent or Purchaser may assign any of their respective
rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent without
the consent of any other party, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent
or Purchaser, as the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.8 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except
as provided in Section 5.16.

 



 

Section 8.9 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party hereto has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender; and the
feminine gender shall include the masculine gender. Except as otherwise
indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits,"
"Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement
and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise
specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be
exclusive. For purposes of this Agreement, the use of the term "including"
shall be deemed to mean "including, without limitation."

 



 

Section 8.10 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all matters arising hereunder or in connection
herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court thereof,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court
of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court thereof,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and
if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate
court thereof. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.10(c).

 



 

Section 8.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

Section 8.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to any valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, (i) each party shall be
entitled at its election to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond, guarantee or other undertaking in connection with the obtaining of
any specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties shall
waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at Law. Either party's pursuit of specific performance at any time
shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue
any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the
right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered
by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or
willful or intentional misconduct.

(iii) one or more of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Article III of the Agreement shall not be true and correct (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" or similar terms) as if such representations and warranties
were made at the time of such determination (except to the extent such

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and

rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (except
the Minimum Condition may not be waived), in each case, subject to the terms
of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.
