ARTICLE II

  


 

  

 _Conversion of Securities_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") or the holders of any shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ "; the Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock
are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Company Capital
Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock
of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of
Company Capital Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Capital Stock held
by a Subsidiary of the Company, if any, shall be converted into a number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each Subsidiary
of the Company owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary of the Company owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock._ Each share of Company Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (ii) except as
provided in Section 2.02, the Appraisal Shares and (iii) except as provided in
Section 2.03, the Restricted Shares that are not Cash-Out Restricted Shares)
shall be converted into (x) with respect to each share of the Company Common
Stock, the right to receive $7.13 in cash, without interest (the " _Common
Stock Merger Consideration_ ") and (y) with respect to each share of the
Company Preferred Stock, the right to receive $1,500 in cash, without interest
(the " _Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ "; and together with the Common
Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Capital Stock to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by
the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such
withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.04(f) and any applicable
tax Law.

  

  

 

3  

  

SECTION 2.02. _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the
Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. _Restricted Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, at the Effective Time, each Restricted Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cash-Out Restricted
Share) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead shall be canceled
and cease to exist, and the Restricted Share Holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive no consideration in respect of such Restricted Shares, except as
provided in Section 5.04(a)(iii).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent
funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of
Certificates, it being understood that all such funds shall be invested as
directed by Parent and that any and all interest or other amounts earned with
respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent.

  

  

 

4  

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying substitute IRS Form W‑9 or
the applicable IRS Form W‑8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be
in a form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions
regarding delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify and which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

  


 

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock._ All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

  


 

  

(d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of
any Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this
Article II in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

 

5  

  

(e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the
applicable Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or
destroyed Certificate.

  


 

  

(f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise
payable to any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent.

  


 

  

(g) _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the six-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates,
and thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 2.04(d), such holders
shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III

  


 

  

 _Representations and Warranties_

  


 

  

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set
forth in the letter (with specific reference to the Section of this Agreement
to which the information stated in such disclosure relates; provided, that
disclosure contained in any section of the Company Letter shall be deemed to
be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent
that it is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other Section of this Agreement) delivered by
the Company to Parent at least one day prior to the date of this Agreement
(the " _Company Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Sub as follows:

  

  

 

6  

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization (except, in the case of good standing, for entities organized
under the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept), (ii)
has all requisite corporate, company, partnership or other organizational
power and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted by the
Company and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing, any
jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept) in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so
organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the
case of clause (i) above, with respect to the Company), individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation of the Company, including any related certificate
of designation, each as amended to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
Certificate_ "), and the bylaws of the Company, as amended to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in
each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the minutes (or, in the
case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the
stockholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since January 1,
2012 (other than portions of any minutes (or drafts thereof) related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Takeover Proposal). The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of all
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, and each committee
thereof, in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  


 

  

(b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Letter sets forth, as of
the date of this Agreement, a complete and correct list of each Subsidiary of
the Company, its place and form of organization, and its address. All the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, each such Subsidiary are owned by the Company, by one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company or by the Company and one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, options, security interests or other encumbrances of any kind or
nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), except for transfer
restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws, and are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except for the capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any person.

  

  

 

7  

  

(c) _Capital Structure._ (i)The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 1,050,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, of which (x)
50,000 shares have been designated Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock ("
_Company Non Voting Preferred Stock_ ") and (y) 50,000 shares have been
designated Company Preferred Stock. At the close of business on July 31, 2015,
(1) 98,901,314 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding treasury shares) were
issued and outstanding, 1,734,358 of which (I) were subject to vesting or
transfer restrictions in favor of the Company and/or subject to forfeiture
back to the Company or repurchase by the Company and (II) were granted
pursuant to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the " _2015 Plan_ ") or the 2005
Equity Incentive Plan (the " _2005 Plan_ ") or otherwise (such shares, the "
_Restricted Shares_ "), (2) 0 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company as treasury shares, (3) 50,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock were
outstanding, with a Liquidation Value equal to $1,000 per share, a Conversion
Price equal to $4.14 per share and Series A Unpaid Dividends applicable to
each share equal to $7.2192 (in each case, as such terms are defined in the
certificate of designation with respect to the Company Preferred Stock
attached to the Company Certificate (the " _Company Preferred Stock
Certificate of Designation_ ") and which were convertible into 12,164,483
shares of Company Common Stock and (4) 11,655,557 shares of Company Common
Stock were reserved and available for issuance in the aggregate pursuant to
the 2015 Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan for Directors (the "
_1998 Plan_ ") and the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ", and
together with the 2015 Plan, the 2005 Plan and the 1998 Plan, the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), of which (A) 6,272,868 shares of Company Common Stock were
subject to outstanding options (other than rights under the ESPP) to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock from the Company (such options whether granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the " _Stock Options_ "),
(B) [RESERVED] and (C) 464,125 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved
and available for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. The Merger will constitute a
Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Company Preferred Stock
Certificate of Designation) and therefore the consideration payable in respect
of the Company Preferred Stock (other than shares of Company Preferred Stock
converted into Company Common Stock prior to the Closing) pursuant to the
Merger is equal to the Change of Control Payment (as such term is defined in
the Company Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation) of $1,500 per share as
specified in Section 5(b)(1) of the Company Preferred Stock Certificate of
Designation. As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Restricted
Shares, none of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock is subject to
vesting or forfeiture conditions or a right of repurchase by the Company. All
outstanding Stock Options and Restricted Shares have been granted under the
Company Stock Plans. Other than the Company Stock Plans, there is no plan,
Contract or arrangement providing for the grant of Stock Options or Restricted
Shares. No shares of Company Non Voting Preferred Stock or any other preferred
stock (other than the Company Preferred Stock) are issued or outstanding. No
shares of Company Capital Stock are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company.
Section 3.01(c)(i) of the Company Letter sets forth (a) a complete and correct
list, as of the close of business on July 31, 2015, of all outstanding Stock
Options, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such
Stock Option, the grant date, exercise price per share, vesting schedule and
expiration date of each such Stock Option, the name of the holder thereof, an
indication of whether or not each such holder is a current director, employee
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Stock Option (or any portion thereof) is intended to qualify as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code and the name of the Company Stock
Plan pursuant to which each such Stock Option was granted and (b) a complete
and correct list, as of the close of business on July 31, 2015, of all
outstanding Restricted Shares, the grant date, vesting schedule, purchase
price (if any) and repurchase price (if any) of each such Restricted Share,
the name of the holder thereof, an indication of whether or not each such
holder is a current director, employee or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, an indication of whether an election pursuant to Section
83(b) of the Code has been made with respect to such Restricted Share and the
name of the Company Stock Plan pursuant to which such Restricted Share was
granted. As of the date of this Agreement, other than the outstanding Stock
Options and the outstanding Restricted Shares and the rights under the ESPP,
there are no outstanding rights of any person to receive Company Common Stock
under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, on a deferred basis or otherwise.
As of the close of business on July 31, 2015, there were outstanding Stock
Options to purchase 6,271,174 shares of Company Common Stock with exercise
prices on a per share basis lower than the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
and the weighted average exercise price of such Stock Options was equal to
$3.82 per share. As of the close of business on July 31, 2015, there were
outstanding rights to purchase 11,667 shares of Company Common Stock on the
last day of the current offering period in effect under the ESPP (assuming the
fair market value per share of Company Common Stock on the last day of the
current offering period in effect under the ESPP will be equal to the Common
Stock Merger Consideration, the shares calculated are based on a share price
at 85% of the lesser of the Common Stock Merger Consideration and the closing
price on the first day of the current offering period, and a Canadian dollar
to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1:0.7639 for contributions from Canadian
employees). As of the last day of the most recent payroll period ending prior
to the date of this Agreement, the aggregate amount credited to the accounts
of participants in the ESPP was $45,558 and the aggregate amount credited to
such accounts for such payroll period was $22,620 (assuming the same Canadian
dollar to U.S. dollar conversion rate set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence).

  

  

 

8  

  

(ii) Except for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, Stock Options and
Restricted Shares set forth in Section 3.01(c)(i), as of the close of business
on July 31, 2015, no shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, or options, warrants, shares of deferred stock, restricted
stock awards, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or other rights
to acquire any such capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
the Company, or other rights that are linked to the value of Company Capital
Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof, were issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding. From the close of business on July 31, 2015 to
the date of this Agreement, (A) there have been no issuances by the Company of
shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the
Company, other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the exercise of Stock Options or rights under the ESPP, in each case
outstanding as of July 31, 2015, and only if and to the extent required by
their respective terms as in effect on such date and (B) there have been no
issuances by the Company of securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, or options, warrants, shares of deferred stock, restricted
stock awards, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards, other rights to
acquire shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
the Company, or other rights that are linked to the value of Company Capital
Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof, other than rights under
the ESPP.

  

  

 

9  

  

(iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be, when
issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and, except as provided in the Investor Rights
Agreement, dated as of February 25, 2015, by and between the Company and the
investors party thereto (the " _Investor Rights Agreement_ "), are not subject
to preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this Section 3.01(c), there are
no (A) bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (B) securities or other instruments or rights (including
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or other similar rights)
issued by, or other obligations of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case, that are linked to, or the value of which is in any way based upon
or derived from, the value of any class of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the value of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any dividends or
other distributions declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or which have or which by their terms may have at any time (whether actual or
contingent) the right to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may vote (the items referred to in
clauses (A) and (B) collectively, " _Equity Equivalents_ "). Except as set
forth in this Section 3.01(c), there are no securities, options, warrants,
calls, rights or Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound, obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract. With
respect to the Stock Options, (1) each Stock Option intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (2) each
grant of a Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which
the grant of such Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant
Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval
by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary
number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such
grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (3) each

(as defined in Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

material modifications, prepared for each Benefit Plan for which a summary
plan description is required under applicable Law, (D) each trust agreement
and group annuity or insurance Contract and other documents relating to the

Benefit Agreement have been invested in all material respects in accordance
with its terms. The Company and its Subsidiaries and each Benefit Plan and
Benefit Agreement are in compliance in all material respects with applicable
Law, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of any collective bargaining
agreements or other labor union Contracts.

  


 

  

(ii) Each Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code is so
qualified and has been the subject of a favorable determination, qualification
or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with
respect to all tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS is currently
willing to provide a determination letter to the effect that such Pension Plan
is qualified and exempt from United States Federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such letter has been
revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been
threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent such
letter or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualification of such Pension Plan.
Each Benefit Plan required to have been approved by any non‑United States
Governmental Entity (or permitted to have been approved to obtain any
beneficial tax or other status) has been so approved or timely submitted for
approval, no such approval has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this
Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the
date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such
Pension Plan that is reasonably likely to affect any such approval relating
thereto or increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered to
Parent a complete and correct copy of the most recent determination,
qualification, opinion or approval letter or similar document received from a
Governmental Entity with respect to each Benefit Plan intended to qualify for
favorable tax treatment or other status, as well as a complete and correct
copy of each pending application for a determination, qualification, opinion
or approval letter or similar document, if any, and a complete and correct
list of all amendments to any such Benefit Plans as to which a favorable
determination, qualification, opinion or approval letter has not yet been
received.

  

  

 

31  

  

(iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been obligated to sponsor, maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent liability under, any Benefit
Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA)
or a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA),
or that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code or that is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or that provides for
the payment of termination indemnities, and neither the Company nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity could incur any liability with respect to any such
plan (under Title IV of ERISA or otherwise).

  


 

  

(iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides welfare benefits,
whether or not subject to ERISA (each, a " _Welfare Plan_ "), is funded
through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e)
of the Code), or is unfunded or self-insured. There are no understandings,
agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that would prevent any Welfare
Plan (including any Welfare Plan covering retirees or other former employees)
from being amended or terminated without material liability to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries at or at any time after the Effective Time. No Welfare
Plan provides benefits, and there are no understandings, written or oral, with
respect to the provision of welfare benefits, after termination of employment,
except as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state
statute or foreign Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the
Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA and any similar state statute or foreign Law
with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined in
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or any similar state statute).

  

  

 

32  

  

(v) Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter sets forth, as of the date of
this Agreement, a complete and correct list of (A) each Benefit Plan and each
Benefit Agreement pursuant to which any Company Personnel could become
entitled to any additional compensation, severance or other benefits or any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation, severance
or other benefits, as a result of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event,
including any termination of employment on or following the Closing), or any
compensation or benefits the value of which would be calculated on the basis
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone
or in combination with any other event, including any termination of
employment on or following the Closing), (B) to the extent permitted by Law,
the names of all Company Personnel entitled to any such compensation or
benefits actually payable as of the Closing Date or upon termination of
employment after the Closing Date, (C) the category or type of each such form
of compensation or benefit to which such Company Personnel is entitled, (D)
the aggregate value of each such form of compensation or benefit actually
payable as of the Closing Date and each such form of compensation or benefit
that would be payable upon termination of employment or otherwise after the
Closing Date, in each case, to all Company Personnel, and (E) the aggregate
value of any such compensation or benefits that would be paid to each
individual set forth in Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter as of the
Closing Date and upon termination of employment. Except as expressly set forth
in Section 5.04, no Company Personnel will be entitled to any severance,
separation, change in control, termination, bonus, retention or other
additional compensation or benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any compensation or benefits, as a result of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following
the Closing) or any compensation or benefits related to or contingent upon, or
the value of which will be calculated on the basis of, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following
the Closing). The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone
or in combination with any other event, including any termination of
employment on or following the Closing) and compliance by the Company with the
provisions of this Agreement do not and will not (A) trigger any funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or give
rise to any other obligation under, any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or any
other employment arrangement, (B) trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed
by any Company Personnel to the Company or any of its affiliates or (C) result
in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both) under, or limit to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
ability to amend, modify or terminate, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

  


 

  

(vi) No deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of the Benefit
Plans or Benefit Agreements has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance
under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

  


 

  

(vii) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to each Benefit
Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any
Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed. All
participant data necessary to administer each Benefit Plan and Benefit
Agreement is in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries and is in a
form that is sufficient for the proper administration of the Benefit Plans and
Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms and all applicable Laws and
such data is complete and correct in all material respects. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no, pending investigations by any
Governmental Entity with respect to, or pending termination proceedings or
other material claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements), suits or proceedings
against or involving or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under, any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

  

  

 

33  

  

(viii) All material contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in
connection with each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement that are required to
have been made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with
the terms of such Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement and applicable Laws have
been timely made. No Benefit Plan, or any insurance Contract related thereto,
requires or permits a retroactive increase in premiums or payments on
termination of such Benefit Plan or such insurance Contract. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, or could reasonably be
expected to incur, any unfunded liabilities in relation to any Benefit Plan or
Benefit Agreement.

  


 

  

(ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Benefit Plan or
trust created thereunder, in each case, who is not a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary_ "), has engaged that could subject the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers or employees or
any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to the tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed
under Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law and (B) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Non-Affiliate
Plan Fiduciary, or any agent of any of the foregoing, has engaged in any
transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a manner, that could
subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees or any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable
Law. No Benefit Plan or related trust has been terminated, nor has there been
any "reportable event" (as such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any
Benefit Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable event
will be required to be filed in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(x) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(xi) Each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section
1.409A-1(a)(1)(a) (a " _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") (A) was
operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code between January 1, 2005
and December 31, 2008, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of
(1) Section 409A of the Code and (2) the final Treasury Regulations and other
guidance issued by the IRS thereunder, to the extent applicable (clauses (1)
and (2), together, the " _409A Authorities_ ") and (B) has been operated in
compliance with the 409A Authorities since January 1, 2009. Each Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan has been in documentary compliance with the 409A
Authorities since January 1, 2009.

  

  

 

34

consistently with their obligations under the Affordable Care Act, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including with respect
to providing notice to employees, offering affordable, minimum value medical
insurance coverage to substantially all of its full-time employees (within the
meaning of Section 4980H of the Code) and otherwise in respect of the
"Employer Shared Responsibility" provisions of Section 4980H of the Code, and
neither Parent nor any of its affiliates is reasonably likely to have any
liability from and after the Closing in connection with such law, rules,
regulations or provisions as they relate to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has attempted to maintain the
grandfathered health plan status under the Affordable Care Act of any Benefit
Plan.

Affiliated Group has timely filed (after taking into account any extensions)
all tax returns required to be filed in the manner prescribed by applicable
Law. All such tax returns are complete and correct in all material respects.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any Company Affiliated Group has
timely paid all taxes due, and the most recent financial statements contained
in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with
GAAP, for all taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial
statements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
for any taxes of any person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
any tax Law), (B) as a transferee or successor or (C) by Contract (other than
Contracts of a commercial nature not principally related to taxes).

  


 

  

(ii) No tax return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Affiliated Group is or has ever been under, or has been threatened in writing

any taxing authority which audit or examination has not been closed, and no
written, or to the knowledge of the Company unwritten, notice of such an audit
or examination has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which audit or examination has not been closed. There is no deficiency, refund
litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any
taxes due and owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Affiliated Group. Each deficiency resulting from any completed audit or
examination or concluded litigation relating to taxes by any taxing authority
has been timely paid. No issues relating to taxes were raised by the relevant
taxing authority during any presently pending audit or examination, and no
issues relating to taxes were raised by the relevant taxing authority in any
completed audit or examination that could reasonably be expected to recur in a
later taxable period. The tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries have

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements, and compliance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreements, the restrictions on "business
combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section 203
of the DGCL to the extent, if any, such restrictions would otherwise be
applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreements, the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements, or compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. No other state takeover or similar statute or regulation is
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreements, or compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(x) _Voting Requirements._ The affirmative vote at the Stockholders Meeting or

Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation in favor of adopting this Agreement

to Parent complete and correct copies of all agreements under which such fee
or commission is payable and all indemnification and other agreements related
to the engagement of the persons to whom such fee is payable. The fees and
expenses of any accountant, broker, financial advisor, consultant, legal

(z) _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ The Board of Directors of the Company has
received the opinion of Goldman Sachs and Co. to the effect that, as of the date

and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.01(c) of this Agreement to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company, solely
for informational purposes, has provided to Parent a copy of any such opinion,
or if such opinion has not been delivered to the Board in written form as of
the execution of this Agreement, then the Company shall deliver to Parent a
copy of any such opinion received by the Board in written form for
informational purposes only promptly following receipt thereof.

49  

  

(b) _Authority; Noncontravention._ Each of Parent and Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

stockholder of Sub). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent and
Sub with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all

this Agreement, to comply with the terms of this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject,

sole stockholder of Sub). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and, assuming the due execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as
applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not and
will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a
right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any
obligation or to a loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Sub under,
or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of Parent or Sub, (ii) any
Contract or Permit to or by which Parent or Sub is a party or bound or to or

sentence, any Law (assuming receipt of the Stockholder Approval and the
adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub) or
Judgment, in each case, applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancelations,
accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in
the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to impair in any material respect the
ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
consent, approval, order or authorization of, registration, declaration or
filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this

or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the compliance by
Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement, except for (A) the
filing of a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act and the
filings and receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of such other
approvals or waiting periods required under any other applicable competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar Law, (B) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and (C) such other
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations,
filings and notices, the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually
or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to impair in any material
respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

50  

  

(c) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied

the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the Company's stockholders, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, as amended or supplemented at
such date or time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

  


 

  

(d) _Interim Operations of Sub._ Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that executed an Offer Letter on or prior to the
date hereof or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company.

  

  

 

58  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or Sub
or any of their affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation or
dissolution involving the Company or any direct or indirect acquisition,
including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
license agreement or similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that
constitute or represent 10% or more of the total consolidated revenue, net
income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (ii) 10% or more of the outstanding voting equity interests of the
Company or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any of the Company's Subsidiaries directly or indirectly
holding, individually or taken together, the assets or businesses referred to
in clause (i) above.

  


 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
binding bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a breach
of Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of
their affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in
the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the
stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50%
of the voting power of the Company Capital Stock or all or substantially all
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which
offer, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel), (i) provides consideration that is more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the consideration payable in
the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

  

  

 

59  

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this
Agreement or the Merger (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such
action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
(ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare
advisable, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or
agree to take any such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or
(iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement constituting or related to, or which is intended
to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or agree
to take any such action (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal or an
Intervening Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; and _provided further_ ,
that the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless (A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have first provided prior written notice to Parent (an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most
current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of an Intervening Event,
attach information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and
(B) Parent does not make, within five business days after the receipt of such
notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial advisor
of national reputation and outside legal counsel), (x) cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal or (y) obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of an Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment or modification of such Superior Proposal (other than a non-
substantive amendment or modification) shall require a new Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice and a new five business day period). The Company
agrees that, during the five business day period prior to its effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and its officers, directors and
representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers,
directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by
Parent.

  


 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Intervening Event_ " means any
event, circumstance or fact developing after the date of this Agreement,
unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, which becomes known prior to the Stockholder Approval and which
causes the Board of Directors of the Company to reasonably conclude in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that its failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or
terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence
thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

  

  

 

60  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and
in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally
and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or
inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a
Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal,
request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification
to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) on a
daily basis at mutually agreeable times, advise and confer with Parent (or its
outside counsel) regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any
Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto
and any other matters identified with reasonable specificity by Parent (or its
outside counsel) and the material details (including material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) promptly upon receipt or delivery
thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all documents
and written or electronic communications relating to any such Takeover
Proposal (including the financing thereof), request or inquiry exchanged
between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors or representatives, on the one hand, and the person making a Takeover
Proposal or any of its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives, on the other hand.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e‑2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, the failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by
Section 4.02(b).

  


 

  

SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent._ During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the
Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in (a) any
representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that
is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any
such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in
any material respect.

 _Additional Agreements_

  


 

  

SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting._ (a)
As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and, no later than the twenty-fifth calendar day (or, if such
calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day subsequent to
such calendar day) immediately following the date of this Agreement, file with
the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning such person to the other as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent
an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent and (iii) if the Board of Directors of the Company shall not have made
an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall not file or mail such document, or
respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, at any time
prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company,
Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  


 

  

(b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent
agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Proxy Statement is
filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time
of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting the Company
shall, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such
action, cause to occur no earlier than the 30th calendar day or later than the
40th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, on the
first business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the
date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), for
the purpose of (x) obtaining the Stockholder Approval, regardless of whether
the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this
Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the
Company reject it or any other Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at
any time and (y) requesting an advisory vote on change-in-control payments to
executives of the Company as required by applicable SEC rules; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its
stockholders at such time, the Company may extend the date of the Stockholders
Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary in order to obtain a
quorum of its stockholders and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable, (ii)
the Company may delay the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required by
applicable Law, (iii) if the Company receives a Takeover Proposal, the price
or material terms of a previously received Takeover Proposal are modified or
amended or an Intervening Event occurs, in any such case during the five
calendar day period immediately prior to the day of the Stockholders Meeting,
the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting until the date
that is the fifth business day after the date on which the Stockholders
Meeting would have otherwise been held and (iv) the Company may adjourn or
postpone the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent)
required by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any
proceedings in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements. The notice of such Stockholders
Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement will be
considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b), (x) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of Company
Capital Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Stockholder Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the
Stockholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested by
Parent.

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ (a) Subject to
compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other
representatives and advisors reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties,
assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors,
officers and employees, and during such period the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent any information
concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request (including the work
papers of BDO USA LLP). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following
reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel
and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the
Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No investigation by Parent
or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other receipt of
information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives shall
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other provision of this Agreement, or the obligations
of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under the Agreement. Except as required by any
applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by Parent, provide Parent, to the extent applicable, with (i) a complete and
correct list of all licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission
(the " _FCC_ ") and held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _FCC
Licenses_ "), (ii) complete and correct copies of each FCC License, (iii) the
address and physical location of the device(s) covered by each FCC License,
(iv) a written description of the purpose of the device(s) covered by each FCC
License, (v) complete and correct copies of any Notices of Apparent Liability
for Forfeiture issued by the FCC against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (vi) all reasonably available information in the possession
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary for Parent to
make an independent determination that the Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership control of the FCC
Licenses (including descriptions of any transactions that effected a change of
ownership or control of the FCC Licenses (including any intracompany
reorganizations) and corporate organizational charts depicting the ownership
structure of the holder of the FCC Licenses before and after any such change
of ownership or control).

  


 

  

(c) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate to ensure an
orderly transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the
disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements), including using its commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental
Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations,

provide any supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity,
including participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the

connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreements or any of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions contemplated by the
Stockholders Agreements, take commercially reasonable actions necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements,
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreements, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
without the prior written consent of Parent, agree or proffer to divest or
hold separate, or enter into any licensing, business restriction or similar
arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or
any portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative,
brought by any Governmental Entity (A) challenging or seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreements, or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any
damages in relation therewith; (B) seeking to prohibit or limit in any
respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of all or any portion of
the business or assets or any product of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Parent or its Subsidiaries or to require any such person to dispose of,
license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold
separate all or any portion of the business or assets or any product of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, in each case as a
result of or in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (C) seeking to directly or indirectly impose
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or
hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of Company Capital
Stock or any shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries, including the right to vote Company Capital Stock or
the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's Subsidiaries,
respectively; or (D) seeking to (1) directly or indirectly prohibit Parent or
any of its affiliates from effectively controlling in any respect any of the
business or operations of the Company or its or Parent's Subsidiaries or (2)
directly or indirectly prevent the Company or its or Parent's Subsidiaries
from operating any of their respective businesses in substantially the same
manner as operated by the Company and its or Parent's Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall provide such
assistance, information and cooperation to each other as is reasonably
required to obtain any such actions, nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations and, in connection therewith, shall notify the other
person promptly following the receipt of any comments from any Governmental
Entity and of any request by any Governmental Entity for amendments,
supplements or additional information in respect of any registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, such Governmental Entity.

  

  

 

65  

  

(b) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good
faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material,
individually or in the aggregate, operational developments, changes in the
general status of relationships with customers and resellers, the general
status of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent
pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such consultation shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in this
Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly, upon
having knowledge, notify Parent in writing of:

  


 

  

(A) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1) is, or that could
reasonably be expected to be, material (individually or in the aggregate) to
the business, assets, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (2) has resulted, or could reasonably be expected to result, in (I) any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (II) any such representation and
warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or

by this Agreement;

  

  

 

66  

  

(D) any notice or other communication from any customer, distributor or
reseller to the effect that such customer, distributor or reseller is
terminating or otherwise materially adversely modifying its relationship with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  


 

  

(E) any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication shall be
furnished to Parent, together with the Company's written notice;

  


 

  

(F) any filing or notice made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and a copy of any such filing or notice shall be furnished to
Parent together with the Company's written notice; and

  


 

  

(G) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.01(h) or that relate to the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements;

  


 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall operate as a waiver
or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

  


 

  

(iii) Parent, upon having knowledge, shall give prompt notice to the Company
of (A) any representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in
Section 6.03(a) could not be satisfied or (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to
perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party
under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b)
could not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreements, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to
settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that
this Section 5.03(c) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense.

  

  

 

67  

  

(d) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
of the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, will adopt this
Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.04. _Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the
following:

  


 

  

(i) at the Effective Time, each Cash-Out Stock Option shall, in accordance
with any applicable Company Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement
thereunder, be canceled and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
in consideration for such cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such
Cash-Out Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out Stock Option,
which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time;

  


 

  

(ii) each Rollover Stock Option shall, in accordance with any applicable
Company Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement thereunder, be converted
at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Rollover Stock Option
(other than with respect to exercisability prior to vesting or the ability to
pay the exercise price by tendering previously owned shares of Company Common
Stock), the number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.20 per share
(" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share),
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Rollover Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Rollover Stock
Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;

  


 

  

(iii) at the Effective Time, each Restricted Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is not a Cash-Out Restricted Share shall, in
accordance with any applicable Company Stock Plan or any applicable award

SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) Parent and Sub

exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth in Section 5.05 of the
Company Letter shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger

and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its successors and
assigns to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations.

  

  

 

71

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,

the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.05.

  


 

  

(c) Parent shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, as of the Effective Time a

liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy
of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall,
prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six‑year period;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay, with respect to the entire six‑year period following the

aggregate exceed 300% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the
period from June 4, 2015 to, and including, June 4, 2016, for such purpose
(which premiums for such period are hereby represented and warranted by the
Company to be $370,999); _provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to the entire six-year period
following the Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 300% amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.05(c) shall require Parent to
make expenditures exceeding $1,112,997 in the aggregate. If requested by
Parent, the Company shall issue a broker of record letter naming the insurance
broker selected by Parent to effect such runoff coverage, and the Company
shall provide all cooperation and information reasonably requested by Parent

runoff coverage.

his or her representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and their successors and assigns and (ii) are in addition to, and

consummation of the Merger.

Agreements, shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,

72  

  

(b) In the event that (i) after the date of this Agreement, a Takeover
Proposal has been made (whether or not conditional and whether or not
withdrawn) to the Company or to its stockholders generally or any person has
announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not
withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover Proposal (whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn) otherwise becomes known to the
Company or generally known to the stockholders of the Company and thereafter
(A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (B) prior to the date that is
12 months after such termination, (x) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or
(y) any Takeover Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this Section
5.06(b)(i)(B), the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set
forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a)
except that all references to 10% shall be deemed references to 30%) or (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), then the
Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $26,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
") by wire transfer of same-day funds (A) in the case of a termination by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such
termination and (B) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred
to in Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of the events
referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above, in each case to an account
designated by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  


 

  

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 5.06 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 5.06, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06 at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreements,
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. The Company shall
consult with Parent before making, and give Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such reasonably practicable consultation, except as
may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system; provided, however, that these restrictions shall
not apply to any Company communications regarding any Takeover Proposal or
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.08. _Resignation of Directors and Officers._ At the Closing, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of any or all the directors and/or

not affect such officer's employment status with the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 8.04. _Exhibits; Interpretation._ The headings contained in this
Agreement or in any Exhibit hereto and in the table of contents to this

interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit
but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For all purposes hereof, the
terms "include", "includes" and "including" shall be deemed followed by the
words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase does not mean simply "if". Except as otherwise provided, any

The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or instrument defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented. References to a person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns.

  

  

 

81  

  

SECTION 8.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or PDF), all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more such
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
(a) together with any Exhibit hereto and the Company Letter, constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreements, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 5.05, is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (and their respective
successors and assigns) any rights (legal, equitable or otherwise) or
remedies, whether as third party beneficiaries or otherwise.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of Laws thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent and Sub may assign, in their
sole discretion, any or all their rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations under this Agreement if such
assignee does not perform such obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.09. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue._ Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the Federal court
of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and
agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement
shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each
of the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such person's respective address set forth above shall be
effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State
of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to
plead or claim), any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery
(and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware
State court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
the State of Delaware) or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

 

82  

  

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in
any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.13. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

 

83  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective signatories thereunto duly authorized, all as of
the date first written above.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  


 

  

Reference is made to that certain Amended and Restated Consulting Agreement
(as amended, the " _Consulting Agreement_ "), dated as of May 29, 2015, by and
between Merge Healthcare Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Merrick Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Merrick_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Consulting Agreement. This letter agreement
(this " _Agreement_ ") shall amend the terms of the Consulting Agreement, as
set forth below.

  


 

  

Now, therefore, Merrick and the Company hereby agree as follows.

  


 

  

1. _Fees and Expenses_. The following is added to the end of Section 4 of the Consulting Agreement as a new paragraph:

  


 

  

"Notwithstanding anything in the Consulting Agreement to the contrary, the Fee
will not be paid or payable in connection with the execution and delivery of
the that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among International
Business Machines Corporation (" _IBM_ "), Datong Acquisition Corp. and the
Company, dated as of the date hereof, as such agreement may be amended,
modified and waived from time to time in accordance with its terms (the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") or consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall only be effective with respect
to the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if and when consummated and
no other transaction. In consideration of the foregoing, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, the Company hereby agrees to pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds upon written request of Merrick all reasonable,
actual and documented expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred by Merrick or its Affiliates (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(the " _Transaction Expenses_ ") in connection with the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement, any other agreement between Merrick and its Affiliates and the
Company, any agreement between Merrick, Michael W. Ferro, Jr. and their
respective Affiliates and IBM and the transactions contemplated thereby."

  


 

  

2. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the amendment of the Consulting Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of the Consulting Agreement and this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control and govern.

  

   

  

3. _No Other Amendments_. Except as specifically modified and amended herein, all of the terms, provisions, requirements and specifications contained in the Consulting Agreement remain in full force and effect.

  


 

  

4. _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of the Parties bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns whether so expressed or not.

  


 

  

5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original but which together shall constitute one instrument.

  


 

  

6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, exclusive of its conflicts of laws provisions.

  


 

  

Please confirm our mutual understanding by signing and returning to the
Company a copy of this Agreement.
