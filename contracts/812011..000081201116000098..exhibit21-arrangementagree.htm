the U.S. Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereunder. In order to

---|--- 

(e)

2.10 Arrangement and Effective Date



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Arrangement shall become effective on the date upon which Whistler and
Vail agree in writing as the Effective Date or, in the absence of such
agreement, five (5) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to completion of the Arrangement set out in Article 6 (excluding
any conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Effective
Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, where not prohibited, waiver of
those conditions as of the Effective Date by the applicable Party or Parties
for whose benefit such conditions exist) and the Arrangement shall be
effective at the Effective Time on the Effective Date and will have all of the
effects provided by applicable Law. 

 

|

Effective Date, or at such other time and place as may be agreed to by the
Parties. 

 

2.11 Payment of Consideration



Vail or Exchangeco will, following receipt by Whistler of the Final Order and
prior to the Effective Time, deposit in escrow with the Depositary (the terms
and conditions of such escrow to be satisfactory to the Parties, acting
reasonably) sufficient funds, Vail Shares and Exchangeable Shares to satisfy
the aggregate Consideration payable to Whistler Shareholders pursuant to the
Plan of Arrangement, plus sufficient funds to satisfy any aggregate cash
payment in lieu of fractional Vail Shares.

2.12 Announcement and Shareholder Communications



The Parties agree to issue jointly a press release with respect to this
Agreement as soon as practicable after its due execution. Vail and Whistler
agree to cooperate in the preparation of presentations, if any, to Whistler
Shareholders regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
Party shall: (a) not issue any press release or otherwise make public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; and (b) not make any filing with any Governmental
Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the consent
of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each Party shall enable the other Party to review and
comment on all such press releases prior to the release thereof and shall
enable the other Party to review and comment on such filings prior to the
filing thereof (other than with respect to confidential information contained
in such filing); provided, however, that the foregoing shall be subject to
each Party's overriding obligation to make any disclosure or filing in
accordance with applicable Laws, including U.S. Securities Laws, and if such
disclosure or filing is required and the other Party has not reviewed or
commented on the disclosure or filing, the Party making such disclosure or
filing shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prior oral or written
notice to the other Party, and if such prior notice is not possible, to give
such notice immediately following the making of such disclosure or filing. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prevent either Party from
making internal announcements to employees and having discussions with
shareholders and financial analysts and other stakeholders so long as such
statements and announcements are consistent with and limited in content to
that contained in the most recent press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions
of this Section 2.12 related to the approval or contents of filings with
Governmental Entities will not apply with respect to filings in connection
with the Regulatory Approvals, the Whistler Circular, the Interim Order or the
Final Order which are governed by other sections of this Agreement.

2.13 Withholding Taxes

Vail, Whistler, Exchangeco, Callco and the Depositary, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or direct Vail, Whistler, Exchangeco, Callco
or the Depositary to deduct and withhold on their behalf, from any
consideration otherwise payable or otherwise deliverable to any Whistler
Shareholders (including in their capacity as former holders of Whistler Equity
Award Holders) under the Plan of Arrangement such amounts as Vail, Whistler,
Exchangeco, Callco or the Depositary, as applicable, are required or
reasonably believe to be required to deduct and withhold from such
consideration under any provision of any Law in respect of Taxes, but, for
greater certainty, the number of Whistler Shares issued to the holders of
Whistler Options, Whistler 

Performance Awards and Whistler RSUs in settlement of such holder\'s Whistler
Options, Whistler Performance Awards or Whistler RSUs, as the case may be,
shall not be reduced to satisfy any such withholding obligation. Any such
amounts will be deducted, withheld and remitted from the consideration payable
pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement and shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to Whistler Shareholders (including
in their capacity as former holders of Whistler Equity Award Holders) in
respect of which such deduction, withholding and remittance was made; provided
that such deducted and withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

2.14 Adjustment of Consideration



Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Vail
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares by reason of
any split or consolidation of the issued and outstanding Vail Shares, then the
Consideration to be paid per Whistler Share shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to Whistler Shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement prior to such action and as so adjusted
shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Consideration to be paid
per Whistler Share.

2.15 Guarantee of Vail



Vail hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual
performance by Exchangeco of each and every obligation of Exchangeco arising
under this Agreement and the Arrangement, including, without limitation, the
due and punctual payment of the Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement.

|

enter into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

acknowledged and agreed that, provided Whistler is then in compliance with its
obligations under this Section 5.9, Whistler may (a) advise a Person who has
submitted a written Acquisition Proposal of the restrictions in this
Agreement, or (b) advise a Person who has submitted a written Acquisition
Proposal that their Acquisition Proposal does not constitute a Superior
Proposal; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or take no
position or remain neutral with respect to, any publicly announced Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal for a period of no more than
seven (7) Business Days following the public announcement of such Acquisition
Proposal will not be considered to be in violation of this Section 5.9(a)(iii)
provided the Whistler Board has rejected such Acquisition Proposal and
affirmed the Whistler Board Recommendation by press release before the end of
such seven (7) Business Day period (or in the event that the Shareholder
Meeting is scheduled to occur within such seven (7) Business Day period, prior
to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the date of the Shareholder Meeting)
and further provided that Whistler shall provide Vail and its outside legal

(v)

|

make a Whistler Change in Recommendation. 

 

| 
---|---

|

Whistler shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,

other activities commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with any Person
(other than Vail and its Subsidiaries or affiliates) conducted by Whistler or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
constitute or lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith,
Whistler will discontinue access to and disclosure of its and its
Subsidiaries' confidential information (and not allow access to or disclosure
of any such confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise)
and shall as soon as possible request, and exercise all rights it has (or
cause its Subsidiaries to exercise any rights that they have) to require the

(c)

|

Whistler represents and warrants as of the date of this Agreement that neither

confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction to which Whistler or any of its Subsidiaries is a Party, except to
permit submissions of expressions of interest prior to the date of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 5.9(e), Whistler covenants and agrees that (i)
Whistler shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce each standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction to which Whistler or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and (ii)
neither Whistler nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Representatives have released or will, without the prior written consent of
Vail (which may be withheld or delayed in Vail's sole and absolute
discretion), release any Person from, or waive, amend, suspend or otherwise
modify such Person's obligations respecting Whistler, or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any standstill, confidentiality, non-disclosure, business
purpose, use or similar agreement or restriction to which Whistler or any of
its Subsidiary is a party; provided, however, that the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the automatic termination or release of any such standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction in accordance with its terms shall not be a breach of this Section
5.9(c). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Whistler shall as soon as practicable, and in any event, within 24 hours,
notify Vail (orally at first and then in writing) if it receives or otherwise
becomes aware of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to an Acquisition Proposal, of
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, including the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and
the material terms and conditions thereof and copies of all material or
substantive documents received in respect of, from or on behalf of any such
Person. Whistler shall keep Vail promptly and fully informed of the status of
developments and discussions and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, including any material changes,
modifications or other amendments thereto. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction between Whistler and any other Person, if at any time following
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Whistler Shareholder Approval
having been obtained, Whistler receives a request for material non-public
information, or to enter into discussions, from a Person that proposes to
Whistler an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.9 (and which has not been withdrawn)
and the Whistler Board determines, in good faith after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to a
Superior Proposal (disregarding, for the purposes of such determination, any
due diligence access condition to which such Acquisition Proposal is subject),
then, and only in such case, Whistler may: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

provide the Person making such Acquisition Proposal with, or access to,
information regarding Whistler and its Subsidiaries, but only to the extent
that Vail had previously been, or is concurrently, provided with, or access
to, the same information; and/or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

enter into, participate in, facilitate and maintain discussions or
negotiations with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, regardless of whether such Person was restricted
from making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an existing standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar restriction
and regardless of the covenants in Section 5.9(c), 

 

if, and only if:



| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Whistler has entered into a confidentiality agreement on terms no less
favourable in aggregate to Whistler than the Confidentiality Agreement; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

Whistler has been, and continues to be, in compliance in all material respects
with this Section 5.9. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Whistler shall not accept, approve or enter into any agreement, understanding
or arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (a "Proposed
Agreement"), other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section
5.9(e)(iii), unless: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the Whistler Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the Whistler Shareholder Approval has not been obtained; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Whistler has been, and continues to be, in compliance in all material respects
with this Section 5.9; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

Whistler has provided Vail with a notice in writing that there is a Superior
Proposal together with all documentation related to and detailing the Superior
Proposal, including a copy of any Proposed Agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

five (5) Business Days (the "Response Period") shall have elapsed from the
date Vail received the notice and documentation referred to in Section
5.9(f)(iv) from Whistler and, if Vail has proposed to amend the terms of the
Arrangement in accordance with Section 5.9(g), the Whistler Board shall have
determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal compared
to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement by Vail; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

prior to entering into such definitive agreement, understanding or arrangement
Whistler terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.2(a)(iv)(B)
and concurrently pays to Vail the amount required to be paid pursuant to
Section 7.3; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(vii)

|

Whistler enters into a definitive agreement, understanding or arrangement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal within five (5) Business Days after the
expiry of the Response Period. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Whistler acknowledges and agrees that, during the Response Period or such
longer period as Whistler may approve for such purpose, Vail shall have the
opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of this
Agreement, including an increase in, or modification of, the Consideration.
The Whistler Board will review any such proposal to determine in good faith
whether Vail's proposal to amend the Agreement would result in the Acquisition
Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the Whistler Board determines
that the Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal as compared to the
proposed amendments to the terms of the Agreement, it will promptly advise
Vail and enter into an amended agreement with Vail reflecting such proposed
amendments. Each successive modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 5.9 and
Vail shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such
Acquisition Proposal from the date on which Vail received the notice and
documentation referred to in Section 5.9(f)(iv) in respect of such new
Superior Proposal from Whistler. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

In circumstances where Whistler provides Vail with notice of a Superior
Proposal and all documentation contemplated by Section 5.9(f)(iv) on a date
that is less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Shareholder Meeting,
Whistler may, or if and as requested by Vail, Whistler shall, either proceed
with or postpone the Shareholder Meeting to a date that is not more than seven
(7) Business Days after the scheduled date of such Shareholder Meeting, as
directed by Vail, provided, however, that the Shareholder Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date later than the seventh (7th) Business Day
prior to the Outside Date. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Whistler Board from making a
Whistler Change in Recommendation or from making any other disclosure to any
securityholders prior to the Whistler Shareholder Approval having been
obtained, if, in the good faith judgment of the Whistler Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Whistler Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties or
such action is otherwise required under applicable Law (including by
responding to an Acquisition Proposal under a directors' circular or otherwise
as required under applicable Securities Laws); provided that: 



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

no Whistler Change in Recommendation may be made in relation to an Acquisition
Proposal unless the requirements of Section 5.9(f)(i)- 5.9(f)(v), inclusive,
have been satisfied; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

prior to making a Whistler Change in Recommendation, Whistler shall give to
Vail not less than 48 hours' notice of its intention to make such a Whistler
Change in Recommendation. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Whistler shall advise its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives of the prohibitions set out in this
Section 5.9 and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.9 by Whistler, its Subsidiaries or Representatives is deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.9 by Whistler. 

 

5.10 Access to Information; Confidentiality

---|--- 

(a)

|

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the

require at all reasonable times, including, for the purpose of facilitating
integration business planning, to its officers, employees, agents, properties,
books, records and contracts, and shall furnish Vail with all data and
information as Vail may reasonably request. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Vail and Whistler acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to
this Section 5.10 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Any such investigation by Vail and its
representatives shall not mitigate, diminish or affect the representations and
warranties of Whistler contained in this Agreement or any document or
certificate given pursuant hereto. 

 

5.11 Employment Arrangements



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Vail covenants and agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, Vail will
cause Whistler, and any successor to Whistler, to agree to honour, perform or
cause to be performed all existing employment, indemnification, retention and
change of control agreements and other compensation and employment and
severance obligations of Whistler and all arrangements for the benefit of the
officers or employees of Whistler party thereto, to the extent disclosed in
the Data Room, and will cause Whistler to make payment of amounts payable
under any employment and retention agreements and incentive and deferred
compensation plans or arrangements (including, without limitation, Whistler's
short term incentive plan), to the extent disclosed in the Data Room, that are
not paid out at the Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement or
otherwise, provided that nothing in this Section 5.11(a) shall give any
employee or officer any right to continued employment or impair in any way the
right of Whistler to terminate the employment of any employee or officer. 

 

5.12 Insurance and Indemnification



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Prior to the Effective Time, Whistler shall purchase customary "tail" policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance from a reputable and
financially sound insurance carrier and containing terms and conditions no
less favourable in the aggregate to the protection provided by the policies
maintained by Whistler and its Subsidiaries which are in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date and providing protection in respect of claims
arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Time
and Whistler will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain such tail
policies in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for six years
from the Effective Time; provided, that Whistler and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to pay any amounts in respect of such coverage prior to the

and, to the extent that they are disclosed in the Whistler Disclosure Letter,
under the articles or other constating documents of Whistler and/or its
Subsidiaries or under any agreement or contract of any indemnified person with
Whistler or with any of its Subsidiaries, and acknowledges that such rights
shall survive the completion of the Plan of Arrangement, and, to the extent
within the control of Whistler, Whistler shall ensure that the same shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right 

thereunder of any such indemnified person and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years
from the Effective Date.

---|--- 

(c)

|

From and following the Effective Time, Vail will cause Whistler to comply with

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If Whistler or Vail or any of their successors or assigns shall (i)
amalgamate, consolidate with or merge or wind-up into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity; or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns and transferees of Whistler or Vail, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations of Whistler or Vail, as applicable,
set forth in this Section 5.12. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person, his or her heirs and
his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, Whistler hereby
confirms that it is acting as trustee on their behalf, and agrees to enforce
the provisions of this Section 5.12 on their behalf. Furthermore, this Section

procedures and within the time limits set out in the Plan of Arrangement. The
agreed amount under such joint elections shall be determined by each such
Whistler Shareholder in his or her sole discretion within the limits set out

5.14 Pre-Acquisition Reorganization



|

(a)

Subject to Section 5.14(b), Whistler agrees that, upon request of Vail,
Whistler shall (i) perform such reorganizations of its corporate structure,
capital structure, business, operations and assets or such other transactions
as Vail may request prior to the Effective Date, acting reasonably (each a
"Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"), and the Plan of Arrangement, if required,
shall be modified accordingly and (ii) cooperate with Vail and its advisors to
determine the nature of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations that might be
undertaken and the manner in which they would most effectively be undertaken. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Whistler and its Subsidiaries will not be obligated to participate in any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization under Section 5.12(a) unless such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization in the opinion of Whistler acting reasonably: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

can be completed immediately prior to the Effective Date, and can be unwound
in the event the Arrangement is not consummated without adversely affecting
Whistler in any material manner; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

is not prejudicial to Whistler or to Whistler Shareholders, as a whole, in any
material respect and cannot reasonably be expected to result in any taxes
being imposed on, or any adverse tax or other consequences to any Whistler
Shareholders incrementally greater than the taxes or other consequences to
such party in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement in the
absence of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

does not require Whistler to contravene any applicable Laws, or its
organization documents; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

does not impair the ability of Whistler to consummate, and will not materially
delay the consummation of, the Arrangement or the making of any Superior
Proposal by any other person. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Vail must provide written notice to Whistler of any proposed Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization in reasonable written detail at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Date. Upon receipt of such notice, Whistler and Vail
shall work cooperatively and use their best efforts to prepare prior to the
Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and things
as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization,
including any amendment to this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement and shall
seek to have any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization made effective as of the
last moment of the Business Day ending immediately prior 

to the Effective Date (but after Vail has waived or confirmed that all of the
conditions set out in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied).



| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Vail agrees that it will be responsible for all reasonable costs and expenses
associated with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization to be carried out at its
request and shall indemnify and save harmless Whistler and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a
result of any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization (including in respect of any
reversal, modification or termination of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization) and
that any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization will not be considered in determining
whether a representation or warranty of Whistler under this Agreement has been
breached (including where any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization requires the
consent of any third party under a Contract). If the Arrangement is not
completed, Vail shall reimburse Whistler forthwith for all reasonable fees and
expenses (including any professional fees and expenses and taxes) incurred by
Whistler in considering or effecting all or any part of the Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization and shall be responsible for any fees, expenses and costs
(including professional fees and expenses and taxes) of Whistler in reversing
or unwinding any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization that was effected prior to the
Effective Date.

obtain the approval of the Whistler Shareholders and shall not require Vail to
obtain the approval of its shareholders; (F) Vail shall pay all of the
cooperation costs and all direct or indirect costs and liabilities, fees,
damages, penalties and Taxes that may be incurred as a consequence of such
requested cooperation or Financing, including actual out-of-pocket costs and

that neither Whistler nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required by Vail to
pay any commitment, consent or other similar fee or incur any other liability
in connection with any such financing prior to the Effective Time; (G) such
requested cooperation does not require the directors, officers, employees or
agents of Whistler or its Subsidiaries to take any action in any capacity
other than as a director, officer or employee or agent; (H) Whistler shall not
be required to provide, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to provide,
cooperation that involves any binding commitment by Whistler or its
Subsidiaries, which commitment is not conditional on the completion of the
Arrangement and does not terminate without liability to Whistler or its
Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement and (I) no such requested
cooperation or financing shall be considered to constitute a breach of the
representations, warranties or 

covenants of Whistler under this Agreement or be capable of impairing or
preventing the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 6.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Whistler and Vail irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a
defence that 

any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty,
each Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where Whistler or Vail is entitled to a Fee and such Fee is paid
in full, Whistler or Vail, as the case may be, shall be precluded from any
other remedy against the other Party at Law or in equity or otherwise
(including, without limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall
not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the other Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective
representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in
the event of fraud or wilful breach of this Agreement by a Party.

(a)

|

at the Effective Time, each Whistler RSU having a grant date of January 31,
2013 outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, and shall be
deemed to, vest with respect to such number of Whistler Shares as is equal to
one half of the number of Retention Shares (as defined in the agreement for
such Whistler RSU) that would have vested if "Target" (as defined in the
agreement for such Whistler RSU) was achieved in the Retention Fiscal Year (as
defined in the relevant agreement for such Whistler RSU), and Whistler shall
issue to the holder of such Whistler RSU such number of Whistler Shares in
settlement of such Whistler RSU, the holder of such Whistler RSU shall be and

central securities register of Whistler shall be, and shall be deemed to be,
revised accordingly, but the holder of such Whistler RSU shall not be entitled
to a certificate or other document representing the Whistler Shares so issued
(for greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section 3.1(a), a Whistler
RSU is only outstanding after September 30, 2016 to the extent that the
Retention Shares vested under the terms of such Whistler RSU on September 30,
2016 but the Whistler Shares in respect thereof have not been issued prior to
the Effective Time); 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

concurrently with the preceding step, each Whistler Performance Award
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, and shall be deemed

Performance Award such number of Whistler Shares, the holder of such Whistler

(c)

|

concurrently with the preceding step, each Whistler Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, and shall be deemed to be,
fully vested and surrendered and transferred to Whistler in consideration for
the issuance by Whistler of that number of Whistler Shares ("Net Surrender
Shares") equal to, rounded down to the nearest whole share, (i) the number of
Whistler Shares subject to such Whistler Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time minus (ii) the number of whole and partial (computed to the
nearest four decimal places) Whistler Shares that, when multiplied by the Fair
Market Value of a Whistler Share is equal to the aggregate exercise price of
such Whistler Option, and the holder of such Whistler Option shall be and
shall be deemed to be the holder of such number of Net Surrender Shares and
the central securities register of Whistler shall be, and shall be deemed to
be, revised accordingly, but the holder of such Whistler Option shall not be
entitled to a certificate or other document representing the Net Surrender
Shares so issued; 

 

| 
---|---

the registered holder thereof shall cease to be, and shall be deemed to cease
to be, the registered holder of each such Dissent Share and the name of such
registered holder shall be, and shall be deemed to be, removed from the
register of Whistler Shareholders in respect of each such Dissent Share, and
at such time each Dissenting Shareholder will have the rights set out in
Section 4.1; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the registered holder thereof shall be deemed to have executed and delivered
all consents, releases, assignments and waivers, statutory or otherwise,
required to transfer and assign each such Dissent Share; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Exchangeco shall be and shall be deemed to be the holder of all of the
outstanding Dissent Shares and the central securities register of Whistler
shall be, and shall be deemed to be, revised accordingly; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

immediately following the preceding step, each Whistler Share (other than any
Whistler Share held by Vail, Exchangeco or any of their respective Affiliates
and any Dissent Share) shall be transferred and assigned, without any further
act or formality on its part, to Exchangeco (free and clear of any liens,
charges and encumbrances of any nature whatsoever) in exchange for the
Consideration, in each case in accordance with the election or deemed election
of such Whistler Shareholder pursuant to Section 3.2, subject to Section 3.4
and Section 3.5, and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

the registered holder thereof shall cease to be, and shall be deemed to cease
to be, the registered holder of each such Whistler Share and the name of such
registered holder shall be, and shall be deemed to be, removed from the
register of Whistler Shareholders;

|

(h)

|

at any time after the completion of the share exchange set out in Section
3.1(f), as promptly as possible after all conditions therefor have been met,
Whistler shall file the prescribed form of election under the Tax Act with the
Canada Revenue Agency electing to cease being a public corporation for the
purposes of the Tax Act, 

 

it being expressly provided that the events provided for in this Section 3.1
will be deemed to occur on the Effective Date, notwithstanding that certain
procedures related thereto may not be completed until after the Effective
Date.

3.2 Consideration Elections



With respect to the transfer and assignment of Whistler Shares (including the
Whistler Shares issued in respect of Whistler RSUs, Whistler Performance
Awards and Whistler Options pursuant to Section 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c))
pursuant to Section 3.1(f):

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

each Whistler Shareholder who is an Eligible Holder may elect to receive the
Consideration Shares to which he, she or it is entitled in the form of Vail
Shares or Exchangeable Shares; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the election provided for in Section 3.2(a) shall be made by a Whistler
Shareholder by depositing with the Depositary, prior to the Election Deadline,
a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form indicating such
Whistler Shareholder\'s election, together with certificates (if any)
representing such Whistler Shareholder\'s Whistler Shares. Whistler shall
provide at least two Business Days\' notice of the Election Deadline to
Whistler Shareholders by means of a news release disseminated on a newswire;
provided that, if the Effective Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the
Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and
Whistler shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline, which rescheduled deadline if necessary shall
be as agreed by Vail and Whistler (acting reasonably), provided that at least
one Business Day of advance notice thereof shall have been provided; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

any Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, once deposited with the
Depositary, shall be irrevocable and may not be withdrawn by a Whistler
Shareholder; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

any Whistler Shareholder who does not deposit with the Depositary a duly
completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline, or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Section
3.2 or of the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, shall be deemed to have
elected to receive Vail Shares. 

 

3.3 Tax Election



Each beneficial owner of Whistler Shares who is an Eligible Holder, and who
has validly elected (or for whom the registered holder has validly elected on
such beneficial owner\'s behalf) to receive Exchangeable Shares shall be
entitled to make an income tax election pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the
Tax Act, or subsection 85(2) of the Tax Act if such beneficial owner is a
partnership (and in each case, where applicable, the analogous provisions of
provincial income tax law), with respect to the transfer of its Whistler
Shares to Exchangeco and the receipt of Consideration in respect thereof by
providing two signed copies of the necessary prescribed election form(s) (or
equivalent information through an alternative document or platform, at Vail\'s
discretion) to the Depositary within 90 days following the Effective Date,
duly completed with the details of the number of Whistler Shares transferred
and the applicable agreed amounts for the purposes of such elections.
Thereafter, subject to the election forms being correct and complete and
complying with the provisions of the Tax Act (and applicable provincial income
tax law), the forms will be signed by Exchangeco and returned to such former
beneficial owner of Whistler Shares within 90 days after the receipt thereof
by the Depositary for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable
provincial taxing authority) by such former beneficial owner. Exchangeco will
not be responsible for the proper completion of any election form and, except
for Exchangeco\'s obligation to return (within 90 days after the receipt
thereof by the Depositary) duly completed election forms which are received by
the Depositary within 90 days of the Effective Date, Exchangeco will not be
responsible for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the failure by
a former beneficial owner of Whistler Shares to properly complete or file the
election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by the
Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation).

3.4 Entitlement to Cash Consideration



In any case where the aggregate cash consideration payable to a particular
Whistler Shareholder under the Arrangement would, but for this provision,
include a fraction of a cent, the consideration payable shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole cent.

3.5 No Fractional Shares



In no event shall any Whistler Shareholder be entitled to a fractional Vail
Share or a fractional Exchangeable Share. Where the aggregate number of Vail
Shares or Exchangeable Shares to be issued to a Whistler Shareholder as
consideration under the Arrangement would result in a fraction of a Vail Share
or an Exchangeable Share being issuable, the number of Vail Shares or
Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, to be received by such Whistler
Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Vail Share or
Exchangeable Share, as the case may be. In lieu of any such fractional Vail
Share, each Whistler Shareholder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest
in a Vail Share or an Exchangeable Share will be entitled to receive a cash
payment equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Vail Reference
Price, rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

ARTICLE 4

DISSENT RIGHTS



4.1 Dissent Rights



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

In connection with the Arrangement, each registered Whistler Shareholder may
exercise rights of dissent ("Dissent Rights") with respect to the Whistler
Shares held by such Whistler Shareholder pursuant to sections 237 to 247 of
the BCBCA, as modified by the Interim Order and this Section 4.1(a); provided
that, notwithstanding section 242(1)(a) of the BCBCA, the written objection to
the Arrangement Resolution referred to in section 242(1)(a) of the BCBCA must
be received by Whistler not later than 4:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) two Business
Days immediately preceding the date of the Shareholder Meeting. Dissenting
Shareholders who: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

are ultimately entitled to be paid by Exchangeco fair value for their Dissent
Shares (1) shall be deemed to not to have participated in the transactions in
Article 3 (other than Section 3.1(e)); (2) shall be deemed to have transferred
and assigned such Dissent Shares (free and clear of any Liens) to Exchangeco
in accordance with Section 3.1(e); (3) will be entitled to be paid the fair
value of such Dissent Shares by Exchangeco, which fair value, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the BCBCA, shall be determined as of the
close of business on the day before the Arrangement Resolution was adopted at
the Shareholder Meeting; and (4) will not be entitled to any other payment or
consideration, including any payment that would be payable under the
Arrangement had such holders not exercised their Dissent Rights in respect of
such Whistler Shares; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid by Exchangeco fair
value for their Dissent Shares, shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement in respect of those Whistler Shares on the 

same basis as a non-dissenting Whistler Shareholder who did not deposit with
the Depositary a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form prior
to the Election Deadline (and shall be entitled to receive the Consideration
from Exchangeco in the same manner as such non-Dissenting Shareholders).



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

In no event shall Exchangeco, Vail or Whistler or any other Person be required
to recognize a Dissenting Shareholder as a registered or beneficial owner of
Whistler Shares or any interest therein (other than the rights set out in this
Section 4.1) at or after the Effective Time, and at the Effective Time the
names of such Dissenting Shareholders shall be deleted from the central
securities register of Whistler as at the Effective Time. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in the Interim
Order, no Person shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights with respect to
Whistler Shares in respect of which a Person has voted or has instructed a
proxyholder to vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution. 

 

ARTICLE 5

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND DELIVERY OF CONSIDERATION



5.1 Certificates and Payments



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Time, Vail or
Exchangeco shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Depositary sufficient
funds and certificates representing Vail Shares and Exchangeable Shares to
satisfy the aggregate Consideration payable to the Whistler Shareholders in
accordance with Section 3.1 plus sufficient funds to satisfy any aggregate
cash payment in lieu of fractional Vail Shares or Exchangeable Shares, which
cash, Vail Share certificates and Exchangeable Share certificates shall be
held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such former Whistler
Shareholders for distribution to such former Whistler Shareholders in
accordance with the provisions of this Article 5. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Whistler
Shares that were transferred pursuant to Section 3.1(f), together with a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form and any such
additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require,
the registered holder of the Whistler Shares represented by such surrendered
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the
Depositary shall deliver to such Whistler Shareholder, the Consideration that
such Whistler Shareholder has the right to receive under the Arrangement for
such Whistler Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3, and
any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

After the Effective Time and until surrendered for cancellation as
contemplated by Section 5.1(b), each certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more Whistler Shares (other than Whistler
Shares held by Vail, Exchangeco or any of their respective Affiliates) shall
be deemed at all times to represent only the right to receive in exchange
therefor the Consideration that the holder of such certificate is entitled to
receive in accordance with Section 3.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.3. 

 

5.2 Lost Certificates



In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Whistler Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1(f) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Consideration deliverable in
accordance with such holder\'s duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form. When authorizing such payment in exchange for
any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to
be delivered shall as a condition precedent to the delivery of such
Consideration, give a bond satisfactory to Vail and the Depositary (acting
reasonably) in such sum as Vail may direct, or otherwise indemnify Vail,
Exchangeco and Whistler in a manner satisfactory Vail, Exchangeco and
Whistler, acting reasonably, against any claim that may be made against Vail,
Exchangeco and Whistler with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

5.3 Withholding Rights



Vail, Exchangeco, Callco, Whistler, the Depositary or the Trustee shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or direct Vail, Whistler, Exchangeco, Callco
or the Depositary to deduct and withhold on their behalf, from any amount
payable to any Person under this Plan of Arrangement (an "Affected Person"),
such amounts as Vail, Exchangeco, Callco, Whistler, the Depositary or 

the Trustee determines, acting reasonably, are required or permitted to be
deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of any other Law
(a "Withholding Obligation") but, for greater certainty, the number of
Whistler Shares issued to the holders of Whistler Options, Whistler
Performance Awards and Whistler RSUs in settlement of such holder\'s Whistler
Options, Whistler Performance Awards or Whistler RSUs, as the case may be,
shall not be reduced to satisfy any such Withholding Obligation. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to the Affected Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts
are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. Vail, Exchangeco,
Callco, Whistler, the Depositary and the Trustee shall also have the right to:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

withhold and sell, or direct Vail, Whistler, Exchangeco, Callco or the
Depositary to deduct and withhold and sell on their behalf, on their own
account or through a broker (the "Broker"), and on behalf of any Affected
Person; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

require the Affected Person to irrevocably direct the sale through a Broker
and irrevocably direct the Broker pay the proceeds of such sale to Vail,
Exchangeco, Callco, Whistler, the Depositary or the Trustee as appropriate
(and, in the absence of such irrevocable direction, the Affected Person shall
be deemed to have provided such irrevocable direction), 

 

such number of Vail Shares or Exchangeable Shares (or the Vail Shares
exchanged therefor) delivered or deliverable to such Affected Person pursuant
to this Plan of Arrangement or the Exchangeable Share Provisions as is
necessary to produce sale proceeds (after deducting commissions payable to the
Broker and other costs and expenses) sufficient to fund any Withholding
Obligations. Any Exchangeable Shares to be sold in accordance with this
Section 5.3 shall first be exchanged for Vail Shares in accordance with their
terms and the Vail Shares delivered in respect of such shares shall be sold.
Any such sale of Vail Shares shall be affected on a public market and as soon
as practicable following the Effective Date. None of Vail, Exchangeco, Callco,
Whistler, the Depositary, the Trustee or the Broker will be liable for any
loss arising out of any sale of such Vail Shares, including any loss relating
to the manner or timing of such sales, the prices at which the Vail Shares are
sold or otherwise.

5.4 Distributions with respect to Unsurrendered Share Certificates



No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Vail Shares or Exchangeable Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding Whistler Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate
shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2. Subject
to applicable Law and to Section 5.3, at the time of such compliance, there
shall, in addition to the delivery of Consideration to which such holder is
thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of
the dividend or other distribution with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Vail Shares or Exchangeable Shares.

5.5 Limitation and Proscription



To the extent that a former Whistler Shareholder shall not have complied with
the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 on or before the date that is six
(6) years after the Effective Date (the "final proscription date"), then the
Consideration that such former Whistler Shareholder was entitled to receive
shall be automatically cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect
thereof and the Consideration to which such former Whistler Shareholder was
entitled, shall be delivered to Vail or Exchangeco, as applicable, by the
Depositary and the Vail Shares and Exchangeable Shares forming part of the
Consideration shall be deemed to be cancelled, and the interest of the former
Whistler Shareholder in such Vail Shares and Exchangeable Shares (and any
dividend or other distribution referred to in Section 5.4) to which it was
entitled shall be terminated as of such final proscription date, and the
certificates formerly representing Whistler Shares shall cease to represent a
right or claim of any kind or nature as of such final proscription date. Any
payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement that has not been deposited or has been returned to the Depositary
or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the final
proscription date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or
nature and the right of any Whistler Shareholder to receive the Consideration
for Whistler Shares pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall terminate and
be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to Exchangeco.

5.6 No Liens



Any exchange or transfer of Whistler Shares pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement shall be free and clear of any Liens or other claims of third
parties of any kind. 

5.7 Paramountcy



From and after the Effective Time: (i) this Plan of Arrangement shall take
precedence and priority over any and all Whistler Shares issued prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) the rights and obligations of the registered holders of
Whistler Shares (other than Vail, Exchangeco or any of their respective
Affiliates), and of Whistler, Vail, Exchangeco, the Depositary and any
transfer agent or other depositary in relation thereto, shall be solely as
provided for in this Plan of Arrangement and the Arrangement Agreement; and
(iii) all actions, causes of action, claims or proceedings (actual or
contingent and whether or not previously asserted) based on or in any way
relating to any Whistler Shares shall be deemed to have been settled,
compromised, released and determined without liability except as set forth
herein.

ARTICLE 6

CERTAIN RIGHTS OF VAIL AND CALLCO TO ACQUIRE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES



6.1 Liquidation Call Right



In addition to the rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions
(including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right), Vail and Callco
shall have the following rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to the proviso in Section 6.1(b) that Callco shall only be entitled to
exercise the Liquidation Call Right with respect to those Exchangeable Shares,
if any, in respect of which Vail has not exercised the Liquidation Call Right,
Vail and Callco shall each have the overriding right (the "Liquidation Call
Right"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or any other distribution of the
assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, and
subject to the sale and purchase contemplated by the Automatic Exchange Right,
to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Vail or any of
its Affiliates) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the
Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder upon payment by Vail or Callco,
as the case may be, to each such holder of the Exchangeable Share Price
(payable in the form of the Exchangeable Share Consideration) applicable on
the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date (the "Liquidation Call
Purchase Price") in accordance with Section 6.1(c). In the event of the
exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Vail or Callco, as the case may be,
each such holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Vail and its Affiliates)
shall be obligated to sell all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder
to Vail or Callco, as the case may be, on the Liquidation Date upon payment by
Vail or Callco, as the case may be, to such holder of the Liquidation Call
Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration) for
each such share, and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to pay any
Liquidation Amount to the holders of such shares so purchased. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Callco shall only be entitled to exercise the Liquidation Call Right with
respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which Vail has not
exercised the Liquidation Call Right. To exercise the Liquidation Call Right,
Vail or Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of its intention to exercise such right
(i) in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Exchangeco or any other voluntary distribution of the assets of Exchangeco
among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at least 30
days before the Liquidation Date, or (ii) in the case of an involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or any other involuntary
distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs, at least five Business Days before the
Liquidation Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Vail and/or Callco has exercised the
Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which
Vail or Callco may exercise the Liquidation Call Right. If Vail and/or Callco
exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date, Vail
and/or Callco, as the case may be, will purchase and the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is
Vail or any of its Affiliates) will sell, all of the Exchangeable Shares held
by such holders on such date for a price per share equal to the Liquidation
Call Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

For the purposes of completing the purchase and sale of the Exchangeable
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right, Vail and/or
Callco, as the case may be, shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the aggregate Liquidation Call Purchase Price for
all holders of the Exchangeable Shares (other than Vail and its Affiliates),
less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3. Provided that such
Exchangeable Share Consideration has been so deposited with the Transfer
Agent, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (other than Vail and its
Affiliates) shall cease to be holders of the Exchangeable Shares on and after
the Liquidation 

Date and, from and after such date, shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the rights of holders in respect thereof (including, without limitation, any
rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) other than the right to
receive their proportionate part of the aggregate Liquidation Call Purchase
Price, without interest, upon presentation and surrender by the holder of
certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the
holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be the holder of the Vail Shares which such holder is entitled
to receive. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or
certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other
documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and the articles of Exchangeco, as
applicable, and such additional documents, instruments and payments as the
Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered
certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Vail and/or Callco, as the case
may be, shall deliver to such holder the Exchangeable Share Consideration such
holder is entitled to receive. If neither Vail nor Callco exercises the
Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, each holder of
Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive, on the Liquidation Date, the
Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by Exchangeco in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder in connection with the liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or any distribution of the assets of
Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs
pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.



6.2 Redemption Call Right



In addition to the rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions
(including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right), Vail and Callco
shall have the following rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to the proviso in Section 6.2(b) that Callco shall only be entitled to
exercise the Redemption Call Right with respect to those Exchangeable Shares,
if any, in respect of which Vail has not exercised the Redemption Call Right,
and notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by
Exchangeco pursuant to Section 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, Vail
and Callco shall each have the overriding right (the "Redemption Call Right")
to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Vail or any of
its Affiliates) on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of the
Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder upon payment by Vail or Callco,
as the case may be, to each such holder of the Exchangeable Share Price
(payable in the form of the Exchangeable Share Consideration) applicable on
the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (the "Redemption Call
Purchase Price") in accordance with Section 6.2(c). In the event of the
exercise of the Redemption Call Right by Vail or Callco, as the case may be,
each such holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all of the
Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Vail or Callco, as the case may be,
on the Redemption Date upon payment by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, to
such holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price (payable in the form of
Exchangeable Share Consideration), and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to
redeem, or to pay the Redemption Price (as defined in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions) in respect of, such shares so purchased. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Callco shall only be entitled to exercise the Redemption Call Right with
respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which Vail has not
exercised the Redemption Call Right. To exercise the Redemption Call Right,
Vail or Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of its intention to exercise such right
(i) in the case of a redemption occurring as a result of a Vail Control
Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable
Share Voting Event, on or before the Redemption Date, and (ii) in any other
case, at least 30 days before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will
notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Vail and/or
Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of
the period during which Vail or Callco may exercise the Redemption Call Right.
If Vail and/or Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right, Vail and/or Callco,
as the case may be, will purchase and the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
(other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Vail or any of its
Affiliates) will sell, on the Redemption Date, all of the Exchangeable Shares
held by such holders on such date for a price per share equal to the
Redemption Call Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable Share
Consideration). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

For the purposes of completing the purchase and sale of the Exchangeable
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Call Right, Vail and/or
Callco, as the case may be, shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the aggregate Redemption Call Purchase Price less
any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3. Provided that such Exchangeable
Share Consideration has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, the holders
of the 

Exchangeable Shares (other than Vail and its Affiliates) shall cease to be
holders of the Exchangeable Shares on and after the Redemption Date and, from
and after such date, shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of
holders in respect thereof (including, without limitation, any rights under
the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) other than the right to receive their
proportionate part of the aggregate Redemption Call Purchase Price, without
interest, upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates
representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall
on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to
be the holder of the Vail Shares which such holder is entitled to receive.
Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates
representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the BCBCA and the articles of Exchangeco, as applicable, and such
additional documents, instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates
shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on
behalf of Vail and/or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver to such holder
the Exchangeable Share Consideration such holder is entitled to receive. If
neither Vail nor Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right in the manner
described above, each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to
receive, on the Redemption Date, the redemption price otherwise payable by
Exchangeco in respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder in
connection with the redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section
7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.



6.3 Change of Law Call Right



In addition to the rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions
(including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right), Vail and Callco
shall have the following rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Subject to the proviso in Section 6.3(b) that Callco shall only be entitled to
exercise the Change of Law Call Right with respect to those Exchangeable
Shares, if any, in respect of which Vail has not exercised the Change of Law
Call Right, Vail and Callco shall each have the overriding right (the "Change
of Law Call Right"), in the event of a Change of Law, to purchase from all but
not less than all of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (other than any
holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Vail or any of its Affiliates) on the
Change of Law Call Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares
held by each such holder upon payment by Vail or Callco, as the case may be,
to each such holder of the Exchangeable Share Price (payable in the form of
the Exchangeable Share Consideration) applicable on the last Business Day
prior to the Change of Law Call Date (the "Change of Law Call Purchase Price")
in accordance with Section 6.3(c). In the event of the exercise of the Change
of Law Call Right by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, each such holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all of the Exchangeable Shares
held by the holder to Vail or Callco, as the case may be, on the Change of Law
Call Date upon payment by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, to such holder
of the Change of Law Call Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable
Share Consideration). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Callco shall only be entitled to exercise the Change of Law Call Right with
respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which Vail has not
exercised the Change of Law Call Right. To exercise the Change of Law Call
Right, Vail or Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of its intention to exercise such
right at least 30 days before the date (the "Change of Law Call Date") on
which Vail or Callco, as the case may be, shall acquire the Exchangeable
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Change of Law Call Right. The Transfer
Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not
Vail and/or Callco has exercised the Change of Law Call Right forthwith after
receiving notice of such exercise from Vail and/or Callco. If Vail and/or
Callco exercises the Change of Law Call Right, Vail and/or Callco, as the case
may be, will purchase and the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (other than
any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Vail or any of its Affiliates) will
sell, on the Change of Law Call Date, all of the Exchangeable Shares held by
such holders on such date for a price per share equal to the Change of Law
Call Purchase Price (payable in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

For the purposes of completing the purchase and sale of the Exchangeable
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Change of Law Call Right, Vail and/or
Callco, as the case may be, shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Transfer Agent, on or before the Change of Law Call Date, the Exchangeable
Share Consideration representing the aggregate Change of Law Call Purchase
Price less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3. Provided that such
Exchangeable Share Consideration has been so deposited with the Transfer
Agent, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (other than Vail and its
Affiliates) shall cease to be holders of the Exchangeable Shares on and after
the Change of Law Call Date and, from and after such date, shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof
(including, without limitation, any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement) other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the
aggregate 

Change of Law Purchase Price, without interest, upon presentation and
surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares
held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Change of Law Call
Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Vail
Shares which such holder is entitled to receive. Upon surrender to the
Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and the articles
of Exchangeco, as applicable and such additional documents, instruments and
payments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such
surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Vail and/or Callco, as
the case may be, shall deliver to such holder the Exchangeable Share
Consideration such holder is entitled to receive.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Dividends and Distributions. A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be
entitled to receive and the Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable
law, on each Vail Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend or other
distribution on each Exchangeable Share: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

in the case of a cash dividend or other distribution declared on the Vail

Vail Share on the Vail Dividend Declaration Date; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

in the case of a stock or share dividend or other distribution declared on the
Vail Shares to be paid in Vail Shares, by the issue or transfer by the Company
of such number of Exchangeable Shares for each Exchangeable Share as is equal
to the number of Vail Shares to be paid on each Vail Share; provided, however,
that the Company may, in lieu of such stock or share dividend or other
distribution, elect to effect a corresponding, contemporaneous and
economically equivalent (as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance
with Sections 3(e) and 3(f)) subdivision of the outstanding Exchangeable
Shares; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

in the case of a dividend or other distribution declared on the Vail Shares in
property other than cash or Vail Shares, in such type and amount of property
for each Exchangeable Share as is the same as or economically equivalent (as
determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3(e)) to the
type and amount of property declared as a dividend or other distribution on
each Vail Share; and 

 

such dividends or other distributions shall be paid out of money, assets or
property of the Company properly applicable to the payment of dividends or
other distributions, out of authorized but unissued shares of the Company or
through the subdivision of outstanding Exchangeable Shares, as applicable. The
holders of Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled to any dividends or other
distributions other than or in excess of the dividends or other distributions
referred to in this Section 3(a).

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Payments of Dividends and Distributions. Cheques of the Company payable at par
at any branch of the bankers of the Company shall be issued in respect of any
cash dividends or other distributions contemplated by Section 3(a)(i) and the
sending of such cheque to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy
the cash dividend or other distribution represented thereby unless the cheque
is not paid on presentation. Certificates registered in the name of the
registered holder of Exchangeable Shares or written evidence of the book entry
issuance or transfer to the registered holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
delivered in respect of any stock or share dividends or other distributions
contemplated by Section 3(a)(ii) or any subdivision of the Exchangeable Shares
under Sections 3(a)(ii) and 3(f), and the sending of such certificates or
written evidence to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the
stock or share dividend or other distribution represented thereby. Such other
type and amount of property in respect of any dividends or other distributions
contemplated by Section 3(a)(iii) shall be issued, distributed or transferred
by the Company in such manner as it shall determine, and the 

issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by the Company to each holder of an
Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the dividend or other distribution
represented thereby. Subject to the requirements of applicable law with
respect to unclaimed property, no holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be
entitled to recover by action or other legal process against the Company any
dividend or other distribution that is represented by a cheque that has not
been duly presented to the Company's bankers for payment or that otherwise
remains unclaimed for a period of six years from the date on which such
dividend was payable.

Record and Payment Dates. The record date for the determination of the holders
of Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment date
for, any dividend or other distribution declared on the Exchangeable Shares
under Section 3(a) shall be the same dates as the record date and payment
date, respectively, for the corresponding dividend or other distribution
declared on the Vail Shares. The record date for the determination of the
holders of Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive Exchangeable Shares in
connection with any subdivision of the Exchangeable Shares under Sections
3(a)(ii) and 3(f), and the effective date of such subdivision, shall be the
same dates as the record and payment date, respectively, for the corresponding
stock or share dividend or other distribution declared on the Vail Shares. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Partial Payment. If on any payment date for any dividends or other
distributions declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3(a) the
dividends or other distributions are not paid in full on all of the
Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends or other
distributions that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates
determined by the Board of Directors on which the Company shall have
sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the payment of
such dividends or other distributions. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Economic Equivalence. The Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith
and in its sole discretion (with the assistance of such financial or other
advisors as the Board of Directors may determine), "economic equivalence" for
the purposes of the Exchangeable Share Provisions and each such determination
shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and its shareholders. In making
each such determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other
factors determined by the Board of Directors to be relevant, be considered by
the Board of Directors: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

in the case of any stock or share dividend or other distribution payable in
Vail Shares, the number of such shares issued as a result of such stock or
share dividend or other distribution in proportion to the number of Vail
Shares previously outstanding; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase Vail Shares (or securities exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Vail Shares), the relationship
between the exercise price of each such right, option or warrant, the number
of such rights, options or warrants to be issued or distributed in respect of
each Vail Share and the Current Market Price of a Vail Share, the price
volatility of the Vail Shares and the terms of any such instrument; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of property
(including without limitation any shares or securities of Vail of any class
other than Vail Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those
referred to in Section 3(e)(ii), any evidences of indebtedness of Vail or any
assets of Vail), the relationship between the fair market value (as determined
by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of such property
to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding Vail Share and
the Current Market Price of a Vail Share; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then outstanding
Vail Shares into a greater number of Vail Shares or the reduction,
combination, consolidation or change of the then outstanding Vail Shares into
a lesser number of Vail Shares or any amalgamation, merger, arrangement,
reorganization or other transaction affecting the Vail Shares, the effect
thereof upon the then outstanding Vail Shares; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event to
holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may differ
from the taxation consequences to holders of Vail Shares as a result of
differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States (except for
any differing consequences arising as a result of differing marginal taxation
rates and without regard to the individual circumstances of holders of
Exchangeable Shares). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Subdivision on Stock or Share Dividend. In the case of a stock or share
dividend declared on Vail Shares to be paid in Vail Shares, in lieu of
declaring the stock or share dividend contemplated by Section 3(a)(ii) on the
Exchangeable Shares, the Board of Directors may, in good faith and in its
discretion and subject to applicable Law and to obtaining all required
regulatory approvals, subdivide, redivide or change each issued and unissued
Exchangeable Share on the basis that each Exchangeable Share before such
subdivision becomes a number of Exchangeable Shares equal to the sum of (i)
one Vail Share, and (ii) the number of Vail Shares to be paid as a share
dividend on each Vail Share. In such instance, and notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, such subdivision, shall become effective on the effective
date specified in Section 3(c) without any further act or formality on the
part of the Board of Directors or of the holders of Exchangeable Shares. For
greater certainty, subject to applicable Law, no approval of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares to an amendment to the articles of the Company shall be
required to give effect to such subdivision. 

 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Certain Restrictions 

 

So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the Company shall
not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in Section 11(a):

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

pay any dividends or other distributions on the Common Shares or any other
shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment
of dividends or other distributions, other than stock or share dividends
payable in Common Shares or any such other shares ranking junior to the
Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of Common
Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with
respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of the assets in the
event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of the
Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of any other
shares of the Company ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares with
respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event
of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of the
Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

issue any Exchangeable Share or any other shares ranking equally with, or
superior to, the Exchangeable Shares, other than, in each case, by way of
stock or share dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares or
pursuant to a shareholders rights plan adopted by the Company; 

 

provided, however, that the restrictions in this Section 4 shall not apply if
all dividends or other distributions on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares
corresponding to dividends or other distributions declared and paid on the
Vail Shares shall have been declared and paid in full on the Exchangeable
Shares prior to or as at the date of any such event referred to in this
Section 4.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Liquidation 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Liquidation Amount. Subject to applicable laws and the due exercise by Vail or
Callco of the Liquidation Call Right (which shall itself be subject to the
sale and purchase contemplated by the Automatic Exchange Right), in the event
of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or any other
distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
entitled to receive from the assets of the Company in respect of each
Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date of such
liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or other distribution (the "Liquidation
Date"), before any distribution of any part of the assets of the Company among
the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the
Exchangeable Shares with respect to dividends or other distributions an amount
per share (the "Liquidation Amount") equal to the Exchangeable Share Price
applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which price
shall be satisfied in full by the Company delivering or causing to be
delivered to such holder the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the
Liquidation Amount. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Payment of Liquidation Amount. In the case of a distribution pursuant to
Section 5(a), and provided that the sale and purchase contemplated by the
Automatic Exchange Right has not occurred and that the Liquidation Call Right
has not been exercised by Vail or Callco, on or promptly after the Liquidation
Date, the Company 

shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon
presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and the articles
of the Company, as applicable, together with such additional documents,
instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may reasonably
require, at the registered office of the Company or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of such holder recorded in the securities register of the Company for the
Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by such holder at the registered
office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Company by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares,
the Exchangeable Share Consideration such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 5(a). On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares
and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect
thereof (including, without limitation, any rights under the Voting and
Exchange Trust Agreement) other than the right to receive, without interest,
their proportionate part of the aggregate Liquidation Amount, unless payment
of the aggregate Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be
made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates and other required
documents in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the Liquidation Amount has
been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Company shall have the
right at any time after the Liquidation Date to transfer or cause to be issued
or transferred to, and deposited in a custodial account with, any chartered
bank or trust company the Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable
Shares represented by certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date been
surrendered by the holders thereof, such Liquidation Amount to be held by such
bank or trust company as trustee for and on behalf of, and for the use and
benefit of, such holders. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of a holder
of Exchangeable Shares as of the date of such deposit shall be limited to
receiving its proportionate part of the aggregate Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares so deposited, without interest, and all dividends and
other distributions with respect to the Vail Shares to which such holder is
entitled with a record date on or after the date of such deposit and before
the date of transfer of such Vail Shares to such holder (in each case less any
amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom) against presentation and surrender of the certificates for the
Exchangeable Shares held by them in accordance with the foregoing provisions.
Upon such payment or deposit of the Liquidation Amount, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes
to be holders of the Vail Shares delivered to them or the custodian on their
behalf.



| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

No Right to Participate in Further Distributions. After the Company has
satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the
aggregate Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share pursuant to this Section
5, such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of
the assets of the Company. 

 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Retraction of Exchangeable Shares 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Retraction at Option of Holder 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Subject to applicable laws and the due exercise by Vail or Callco of the
Retraction Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at
any time to require the Company to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable
Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to
the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the
Retraction Date (the "Retraction Price"), which price shall be satisfied in
full by the Company delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the Retraction Price. A holder
of Exchangeable Shares must give notice of a request to redeem by presenting
and surrendering to the Company, at the registered office of the Company or at
any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice
to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, the certificate or certificates
representing the Exchangeable Shares that such holder desires to have the
Company redeem, together with (A) such other documents and instruments as may
be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the BCBCA and
the articles of the Company, as applicable, together with such additional
documents, instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may
reasonably require and (B) a duly executed request (the ''Retraction
Request'') in the form of Appendix I hereto or in such other form as may be
acceptable to the Company: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

specifying that such holder desires to have all or any number specified
therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or
certificates (the "Retracted Shares") redeemed by the Company; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

stating the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the Company
redeem the Retracted Shares (the "Retraction Date"), provided that the
Retraction Date shall not be less than 10 Business Days nor more than 15
Business Days after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by
the Company and further provided that, in the event that no such Business Day
is specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction Date
shall be deemed to be the 15th Business Day after the date on which the
Retraction Request is received by the Company, subject to Section 6(a)(v); and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

acknowledging the overriding right (the "Retraction Call Right") of Vail and
Callco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares directly
from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be deemed to be a
revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Vail or Callco
in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the Retraction Date for the
Retraction Call Right Purchase Price and on the other terms and conditions set
out in Section 6(b). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

In the case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to this Section
6(a), upon receipt by the Company or the Transfer Agent in the manner
specified in Section 6(a)(i) of a certificate or certificates representing the
number of Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Company
redeem, together with a duly executed Retraction Request and such additional
documents and instruments specified in Section 6(a)(i) or that the Company may
reasonably require, and provided that (A) the Retraction Request has not been
revoked by the holder of such Retracted Shares in the manner specified in
Section 6(a)(iv), and (B) neither Vail nor Callco has exercised the Retraction
Call Right, the Company shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the
close of business on the Retraction Date. On the Retraction Date, the Company
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder, at the address of the
holder recorded in the securities register of the Company for the Exchangeable
Shares or at the address specified in the Retraction Request or by holding for
pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Company or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable Share Consideration
representing the Retraction Price and such delivery of such Exchangeable Share
Consideration by or on behalf of the Company by the Transfer Agent shall be
deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the
Retraction Price to the extent that the same is represented by such
Exchangeable Share Consideration, unless any cheque comprising part of such
Exchangeable Share Consideration is not paid on due presentation. If only a
part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed, a
new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to
the holder at the expense of the Company. On and after the close of business
on the Retraction Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a
holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the rights of a holder in respect thereof (including, without limitation, any
rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement), other than the right to
receive the aggregate Retraction Price in respect thereof, unless payment of
the aggregate Retraction Price payable to such holder shall not be made upon
presentation and surrender of share certificates and other required documents
in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of such
holder shall remain unaffected until such aggregate Retraction Price has been
paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of business
on the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of the
certificates and payment of such aggregate Retraction Price has been made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares
so redeemed by the Company shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be a holder of the Vail Shares delivered to such holder. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6, the Company shall not
be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction
Request if and to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would be
contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable laws. If
the Company believes, after due enquiry, that on any Retraction Date it would
not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares
tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that neither Vail nor
Callco has exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to such Retracted
Shares, the Company shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares
specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum
number that may be so redeemed (rounded down 

to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and
shall notify the holder and the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to
the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be
redeemed by the Company. In any case in which the redemption by the Company of
Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other
provisions of applicable laws, the Company shall redeem Retracted Shares in
accordance with Section 6(a)(ii) on a pro rata basis in proportion to the
total number of Exchangeable Shares tendered for retraction and shall issue to
each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense of the
Company, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Company
pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii). If the Company would otherwise be obligated to
redeem Retracted Shares pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) but is not obligated to
do so as a result of solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable
laws, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Company
pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) as a result of solvency requirements or other
provisions of applicable laws shall be deemed, by delivery of the Retraction
Request, to have instructed the Transfer Agent to require Vail or Callco to
purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as
soon as practicable thereafter on payment by Vail or Callco to such holder of
the aggregate Retraction Price in respect of such Retracted Shares, all as
more specifically provided for in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.



| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder to
the Company before the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request, in which event
such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the
revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted
Shares to Vail or Callco shall be deemed to have been revoked. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6(a), if: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

exercise of the rights of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, or any of
them, to require the Company to redeem any Exchangeable Shares pursuant to
this Section 6(a) on any Retraction Date would require listing particulars or
any similar document to be issued in order to obtain the approval of the NYSE
to the listing and trading (subject to official notice of issuance) of the
Vail Shares that would be required to be delivered to such holders of
Exchangeable Shares in connection with the exercise of such rights; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

as a result of (A) above, it would not be practicable (notwithstanding the
reasonable endeavours of Vail) to obtain such approvals in time to enable all
or any of such Vail Shares to be admitted to listing and trading by the NYSE
(subject to official notice of issuance) when so delivered; the Retraction
Date shall, notwithstanding any other date specified or otherwise deemed to be
specified in any relevant Retraction Request, be deemed for all purposes to be
the earlier of (i) the second Business Day immediately following the date the
approvals referred to in Section 6(a)(v)(A) are obtained and (ii) the date
which is 30 Business Days after the date on which the relevant Retraction
Request is received by the Company, and references in these Exchangeable Share
Provisions to such Retraction Date shall be construed accordingly. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Retraction Call Rights 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

In the event that a holder of Exchangeable Shares delivers a Retraction
Request pursuant to Section 6(a), and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 6(a)(ii) (including that Callco shall only be entitled to exercise its
Retraction Call Right with respect to those holders of Exchangeable Shares, if
any, in respect of which Vail has not exercised its Retraction Call Right),
the Retraction Call Right will be available to each of Vail and Callco,
notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by the
Company pursuant to Section 6(a), to purchase from such holder on the
Retraction Date all but not less than all of the Retracted Shares held by such
holder on payment by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, of an amount per
share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business
Day prior to the Retraction Date (the "Retraction Call Right Purchase Price"),
which price shall be satisfied in full by Vail or Callco, as the case may,
delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the Retraction Call Right Purchase Price. Upon the
exercise of the Retraction Call Right in respect of Retracted Shares, the
holder of such Retracted Shares shall be obligated to sell all of such
Retracted Shares to Vail or Callco, as the case may be, on the Retraction Date
on payment by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, of the aggregate 

Retraction Call Right Purchase Price in respect of such Retracted Shares as
set forth in this Section 6(b)(i).



| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Upon receipt by the Company of a Retraction Request, the Company shall
immediately notify Vail and Callco thereof and shall provide Vail and Callco
with a copy of the Retraction Request. Callco shall only be entitled to
exercise its Retraction Call Right with respect to those holders of Retracted
Shares, if any, in respect of which Vail has not exercised its Retraction Call
Right. In order to exercise its Retraction Call Right, Vail or Callco, as the
case may be, must notify the Company in writing of its determination to do so
(a "Retraction Call Notice") within five Business Days after the Company
notifies Vail and Callco of the Retraction Request. If neither Vail nor Callco
so notifies the Company within such five Business Day period, the Company
shall notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that neither Vail nor
Callco will exercise the Retraction Call Right. If one or both of Vail and
Callco delivers a Retraction Call Notice within such five Business Day period
and duly exercises its Retraction Call Right in accordance with this Section
6(b)(ii), the obligation of the Company to redeem the Retracted Shares shall
terminate and, provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the
holder of such Retracted Shares in the manner specified in Section 6(a)(iv),
Vail or Callco, as the case may be, shall purchase from such holder and such
holder shall sell to Vail or Callco, as the case may be, on the Retraction
Date the Retracted Shares for an amount per share equal to the Retraction Call
Right Purchase Price. Provided that the aggregate Retraction Call Right
Purchase Price has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent as provided in
Section 6(b)(iii), the closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted
Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred
as at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty,
no redemption by the Company of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the
Retraction Date. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

For the purpose of completing a purchase of Retracted Shares pursuant to the
exercise of the Retraction Call Right, Vail or Callco, as the case may be,
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holder of such Retracted Shares,
at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the
Company for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the
holder's Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the
registered office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the Retraction Call Right
Purchase Price to which such holder is entitled and such delivery of
Exchangeable Share Consideration on behalf of Vail or Callco, as the case may
be, shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all
liability for the Retraction Call Right Purchase Price to the extent that the
same is represented by such Exchangeable Share Consideration, unless any
cheque comprising part of such Exchangeable Share Consideration is not paid on
due presentation. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of the
Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof
(including, without limitation, any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement), other than the right to receive the aggregate Retraction Call
Right Purchase Price in respect thereof, unless payment of the aggregate
Retraction Call Right Purchase Price payable to such holder shall not be made
upon presentation and surrender of share certificates and other required
documents in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until such aggregate Retraction
Call Right Purchase Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.
On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of such aggregate
Retraction Call Right Purchase Price has been made in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so purchased by Vail
or Callco, as the case may be, shall thereafter be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be a holder of the Vail Shares delivered to such holder. 

 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Redemption of Exchangeable Shares by the Company 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Redemption Amount. Subject to applicable laws and the due exercise by Vail or
Callco of the Redemption Call Right, the Company shall on the Redemption Date
redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares
(other than Exchangeable Shares held by Vail and its affiliates) for an amount
per share (the "Redemption Price") equal to the Exchangeable Share Price on
the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, which price shall be
satisfied in full by the Company delivering or causing to be delivered 

to each holder of Exchangeable Shares the Exchangeable Share Consideration for
each Exchangeable Share held by such holder.



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notice of Redemption. In the case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to Section 7(a), the Company shall, at least 30 days before the
Redemption Date (other than a Redemption Date established in connection with a
Vail Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt
Exchangeable Share Voting Event), send or cause to be sent to each holder of
Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the Company or
the purchase by Vail or Callco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case
may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. In the case of a
Redemption Date established in connection with a Vail Control Transaction, an
Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event,
the written notice of the redemption by the Company or the purchase by Vail or
Callco, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares under the Redemption
Call Right will be sent on or before the Redemption Date, on as many days'
prior written notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be
reasonably practicable in the circumstances. In any such case, such notice
shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the
Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and,
if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right. In the case of any
notice given in connection with a possible Redemption Date, such notice will
be given contingently and will be withdrawn if the contingency does not occur. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Payment of Redemption Price. On or promptly after the Redemption Date, and
provided that the Redemption Call Right has not been exercised by Vail or
Callco, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each such
Exchangeable Share, upon presentation and surrender of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the BCBCA and the articles of the Company, as applicable, together with
such additional documents, instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and
the Company may reasonably require, at the registered office of the Company or
at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by notice to the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the Redemption Price for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Company for the
Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered
office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to
the holders of Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable Share Consideration
representing the Redemption Price. On and after the Redemption Date, the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be
holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any
of the rights of holders in respect thereof (including, without limitation,
any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) other than the right
to receive, without interest, their proportionate part of the aggregate
Redemption Price, unless payment of the aggregate Redemption Price for such
Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of
certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the Redemption Price has
been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Company shall have the
right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the
Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the
aggregate Redemption Price (in the form of Exchangeable Share Consideration)
of the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the said
Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of

Shares; provided, however, that, for greater certainty, the above restrictions
shall not apply to any securities issued or distributed by Vail in order to

the exchange of shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement
immediately subsequent to the Vail Control Transaction being entitled to
receive that number of Other Shares equal to the number of Other Shares such
holder of Exchangeable Shares would have received if the exchange, redemption
or retraction of such shares pursuant to these Exchangeable Share Provisions
or the Plan of Arrangement or the exchange of such shares pursuant to the

COVENANTS OF VAIL AND EXCHANGECO



2.1 Covenants Regarding Exchangeable Shares



So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Vail or its affiliates are
outstanding, Vail shall: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

not take any action that will result in the declaration or payment of any
dividend or make any other distribution on the Vail Shares unless: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Exchangeco shall (A) simultaneously declare or pay, as the case may be, an
equivalent dividend or other distribution economically equivalent thereto (as
determined in accordance with the Exchangeable Share Provisions) on the
Exchangeable Shares (an "Equivalent Dividend"), and (B) have sufficient money
or other assets or authorized but unissued securities available to enable the
due declaration and the due and punctual payment, in accordance with
applicable law and the Exchangeable Share Provisions, of any such Equivalent
Dividend; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

if the dividend or other distribution is a stock or share dividend or
distribution of stock or shares, and if Exchangeco so chooses as an
alternative to taking the action described in (i), in lieu of such dividend or
other distribution on the Vail Shares, Exchangeco shall: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

effect a corresponding, contemporaneous and economically equivalent
subdivision of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares (as determined in
accordance with the Exchangeable Share Provisions) (an "Equivalent Stock
Subdivision"), and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

have sufficient authorized but unissued securities available to enable the
Equivalent Stock Subdivision; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

advise Exchangeco sufficiently in advance of the declaration by Vail of any
dividend or other distribution on the Vail Shares and take all such other
actions as are reasonably necessary or desirable, in co-operation with
Exchangeco, to ensure that: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the respective declaration date, record date and payment date for an
Equivalent Dividend shall be the same as the declaration date, record date and
payment date for the corresponding dividend or other distribution on the Vail
Shares; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the record date and effective date for an Equivalent Stock Subdivision shall
be the same as the record date and payment date for the corresponding stock or
share dividend or distribution of stock or shares, in lieu of such a dividend
or other distribution on the Vail Shares and that such Equivalent Stock
Subdivision shall comply with the requirements of the stock exchange on which
the Exchangeable Shares are then listed; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

take all such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or
desirable to enable and permit Exchangeco, in accordance with applicable law,
to pay and otherwise perform its obligations with respect to the satisfaction
of the Liquidation Amount, the Retraction Price or the Redemption Price in
respect of each issued and outstanding Exchangeable Share upon the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or any other distribution
of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding
up its affairs, the delivery of a Retraction Request by a holder of
Exchangeable Shares or a redemption of Exchangeable Shares by Exchangeco, as
the case may be, including without limitation all such actions and all such
things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit Exchangeco to
deliver or cause to be delivered Vail Shares or other property to the holders
of Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5, 6 or
7, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Share Provisions; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

take all such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or
desirable to enable and permit the Trustee in accordance with applicable law
to perform its obligations under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement,
including, without limitation, all such actions and all such things as are
reasonably necessary or desirable to enable and permit the Trustee in its
capacity as trustee under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement to exercise
such number of votes in respect of a Vail Meeting or a Vail Consent (as such
terms are defined in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) as is equal to
the aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares outstanding at the relevant time
other than those held by Vail and its affiliates; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

take all such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or
desirable to enable and permit Vail or Callco, as the case may be, in
accordance with applicable law, to perform its obligations arising upon the
exercise by it of the Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right, the
Change of Law Call Right (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement) or the
Redemption Call Right, including without limitation all such actions and all
such things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit Vail or Callco,
as the case may be, to deliver or 

cause to be delivered Vail Shares or other property to the holders of
Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the provisions of the Liquidation Call
Right, the Retraction Call Right, the Change of Law Call Right or the
Redemption Call Right, as the case may be; and



| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

not exercise its vote as a shareholder of Exchangeco to initiate the voluntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Exchangeco or any other distribution
of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding
up its affairs, nor take any action or omit to take any action that is
designed to result in the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Exchangeco
or any other distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders
for the purpose of winding up its affairs. 

 

2.1 Segregation of Funds



Vail will cause Exchangeco to deposit a sufficient amount of funds in a
separate account of Exchangeco and segregate a sufficient amount of such other
assets and property as is necessary to enable Exchangeco to pay or otherwise
satisfy its obligations with respect to the applicable dividend, Liquidation
Amount, Retraction Price or Redemption Price, in each case once such amounts
become payable under the terms of this Agreement or the Exchangeable Share
Provisions. Exchangeco will use such funds, assets and property so segregated
exclusively for the payment of dividends and the payment or other satisfaction
of the Liquidation Amount, the Retraction Price or the Redemption Price, as
applicable net of any corresponding withholding tax obligations and for the
remittance of such withholding tax obligations.

2.2 Reservation of Vail Shares



Vail hereby represents, warrants and covenants in favour of Exchangeco and
Callco that Vail has reserved for issuance and shall, at all times while any
Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, keep available, free from pre-emptive and
other rights, out of its authorized and unissued capital stock such number of
Vail Shares (or other shares or securities into which Vail Shares may be
reclassified or changed as contemplated by Section 2.6):

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

as is equal to the sum of (i) the number of Exchangeable Shares issued and
outstanding from time to time and (ii) the number of Exchangeable Shares
issuable upon the exercise of all rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares
outstanding from time to time; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

as are now and may hereafter be required to enable and permit each of Vail,
Callco and Exchangeco to meet its obligations under the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement, the Exchangeable Share Provisions and any other security or
commitment relating to the Arrangement pursuant to which Vail may now or
hereafter be required to issue or cause to be issued Vail Shares. 

 

2.3 Notification of Certain Events



In order to assist Vail to comply with its obligations hereunder and to permit
Vail or Callco to exercise, as the case may be, the Liquidation Call Right,
the Retraction Call Right, the Change of Law Call Right or the Redemption Call
Right, as applicable, Exchangeco shall notify Vail and Callco of each of the
following events at the time set forth below:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in the event of any determination by the board of directors of Exchangeco to
institute voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up proceedings with
respect to Exchangeco or to effect any other distribution of the assets of
Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs,
at least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of such liquidation,
dissolution, winding-up or other distribution; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

promptly upon the earlier of (i) receipt by Exchangeco of notice of, and (ii)
Exchangeco otherwise becoming aware of, any threatened or instituted claim,
suit, petition or other proceedings with respect to the involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or to effect any other
distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

immediately, upon receipt by Exchangeco of a Retraction Request; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

on the same date on which notice of redemption is given to holders of
Exchangeable Shares, upon the determination of a Redemption Date in accordance
with the Exchangeable Share Provisions; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

as soon as practicable upon the issuance by Exchangeco of any Exchangeable
Shares or rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares (other than the issuance of
Exchangeable Shares and rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the
Arrangement); and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

promptly, upon receiving notice of a Change of Law (as such term is defined in
the Plan of Arrangement). 

 

2.5 Delivery of Vail Shares



Upon notice from Callco or Exchangeco of any event that requires Callco or
Exchangeco to deliver or cause to be delivered Vail Shares to any holder of
Exchangeable Shares, Vail shall forthwith issue and deliver or cause to be
delivered the requisite number of shares of Vail Shares for the benefit of
Callco or Exchangeco, as appropriate, and Callco or Exchangeco, as the case
may be, shall forthwith cause to be delivered the requisite number of Vail
Shares to be received by or for the benefit of the former holder of the
surrendered Exchangeable Shares. All such Vail Shares shall be duly authorized
and validly issued as fully paid, non-assessable, free of preemptive rights
and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance.

2.6 Qualification of Vail Shares



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Vail covenants and agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonably
efforts to (a) file a registration statement (the "Registration Statement") on
Form S-3 (or any successor form) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "1933 Act") to register any and all of the Vail Shares to be
issued or delivered to holders of the Exchangeable Shares by Vail or Callco
(including, for greater certainty, pursuant to the Exchange Right or the
Automatic Exchange Right), (b) cause the Registration Statement to become
effective prior to the time that any Exchangeable Shares are first issued, and
(c) cause the Registration Statement (or a successor registration statement)
to remain effective at all times that any Exchangeable Shares remain
outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Vail and Callco
each covenant and agree that it will take all such actions and do all such
things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to make such filings and seek
such regulatory consents and approvals as are necessary so that the Vail
Shares to be issued or delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares by Vail or
Callco pursuant to the terms of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the Voting
and Exchange Trust Agreement and this Agreement will be offered, sold, issued
and delivered in compliance with the 1933 Act and all applicable state
securities laws, and applicable securities laws in Canada and will use
commercially reasonably efforts to ensure that the Vail Shares will not be
"restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the 1933 Act or
subject to any "hold period" resale restriction under National Instrument
45-102 Resale of Securities. Vail will in good faith expeditiously take all
such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable
to cause all Vail Shares to be delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to the terms of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the Voting and
Exchange Trust Agreement and this Agreement to be listed, quoted and posted
for trading on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which outstanding
Vail Shares have been listed by Vail and remain listed and are quoted or
posted for trading at such time. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, or
any term of this Agreement, the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement or the
Plan of Arrangement, no Vail Shares shall be issued (and Vail will not be
required to issue any Vail Shares) in connection with any liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco, or any retraction, redemption or any
other exchange, direct or indirect, of Exchangeable Shares, if such issuance
of Vail Shares would not be permitted by applicable laws. 

 

2.7 Economic Equivalence



(1) So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Vail or its affiliates are
outstanding:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Vail shall not without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval
of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section
11(b) of the Exchangeable Share Provisions: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

issue or distribute Vail Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible
into or carrying rights to acquire Vail Shares) to the holders of all or
substantially all of the then outstanding Vail Shares by way of stock or share
dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of Vail Shares (or
securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire
Vail Shares) to holders of Vail Shares (A) who exercise an option to receive
dividends in Vail Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into
or carrying rights to acquire Vail Shares) in lieu of receiving cash
dividends, or (B) pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan or scrip dividend
or similar arrangement; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or
substantially all of the then outstanding Vail Shares entitling them to
subscribe for or to purchase Vail Shares (or securities exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Vail Shares); or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

issue or distribute to the holders of all or substantially all of the then
outstanding Vail Shares (A) shares or securities of Vail of any class other
than Vail Shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for or
carrying rights to acquire Vail Shares), (B) rights, options, warrants or
other assets other than those referred to in Section 2.6(1)(a)(ii), (C)
evidence of indebtedness of Vail or (D) assets of Vail; 

 

unless, in each case, Exchangeco issues or distributes the economic equivalent
of such rights, options, warrants, securities, shares, evidences of
indebtedness or other assets simultaneously to holders of the Exchangeable
Shares; provided, however, that, for greater certainty, the above restrictions
shall not apply to any securities issued or distributed by Vail in order to
give effect to and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and in
accordance with, the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Vail shall not without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval
of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section
11(b) of the Exchangeable Share Provisions: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Vail Shares into a greater
number of Vail Shares; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then outstanding Vail Shares into a
lesser number of Vail Shares; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

reclassify or otherwise change the Vail Shares or effect an amalgamation,
merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the Vail Shares; 

 

unless, in each case, the same or an economically equivalent change is made
simultaneously to, or in the rights of the holders of, the Exchangeable
Shares; provided, however, that, for greater certainty, the above restrictions
shall not apply to any securities issued or distributed by Vail in order to
give effect to and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and in
accordance with the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement.

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

The board of directors of Exchangeco shall determine, in good faith and in its
sole discretion (with the assistance of such financial or other advisors as
the board of may determine), "economic equivalence" for the purposes of any
event referred to in Section 2.6(1)(a) or Section 2.6(1)(b) and each such
determination shall be conclusive and binding on Vail. In making each such
determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other factors
determined by the board of directors of Exchangeco to be relevant, be
considered by the board of directors of Exchangeco: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in the case of any stock or share dividend or other distribution payable in
Vail Shares, the number of such shares issued as a result of such stock or
share dividend or other distribution in proportion to the number of Vail
Shares previously outstanding; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase Vail Shares (or securities exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Vail Shares), the relationship
between the exercise price of each such right, option or warrant, the number
of such rights, options or warrants to be issued or distributed in respect of
each Vail Share and the Current Market Price of a Vail Share, the price
volatility of the Vail Shares and the terms of any such instrument; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of property
(including without limitation any shares or securities of Vail of any class
other than Vail Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those
referred to in Section 2.6(2)(b), any evidences of indebtedness of Vail or any
assets of Vail), the relationship between the fair market value (as determined
by the board of directors of Exchangeco in the manner above contemplated) of
such property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding
Vail Share and the Current Market Price of a Vail Share; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then outstanding
Vail Shares into a greater number of Vail Shares or the reduction,
combination, consolidation or change of the then outstanding Vail Shares into
a lesser number of Vail Shares or any amalgamation, merger, arrangement,
reorganization or other transaction affecting Vail Shares, the effect thereof
upon the then outstanding Vail Shares; and 



| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event to
holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may differ
from the taxation consequences to holders of Vail Shares as a result of
differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States (except for
any differing consequences arising as a result of differing marginal taxation
rates and without regard to the individual circumstances of holders of
Exchangeable Shares). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

Exchangeco agrees that, to the extent required, upon due notice from Vail,
Exchangeco shall use its best efforts to take or cause to be taken such steps
as may be necessary for the purposes of ensuring that appropriate dividends
are paid or other distributions are made by Exchangeco, or subdivisions,
redivisions or changes are made to the Exchangeable Shares, in order to
implement the required economic equivalence with respect to the Vail Shares
and Exchangeable Shares as provided for in this Section 2.6. 

 

2.8 Tender Offers



In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over
bid or similar transaction with respect to Vail Shares (an "Offer") is
proposed by Vail or is proposed to Vail or its shareholders and is recommended
by the board of directors of Vail, or is otherwise effected or to be effected
with the consent or approval of the board of directors of Vail, and the
Exchangeable Shares are not redeemed by Exchangeco or purchased by Vail or
Callco pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Vail and Exchangeco will use
reasonable efforts to take all such actions and do all such things as are
necessary or desirable to enable and permit holders of Exchangeable Shares
(other than Vail and its affiliates) to participate in such Offer to the same
extent and on an economically equivalent basis as the holders of Vail Shares,
without discrimination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Vail
and Exchangeco will use reasonable efforts in good faith to ensure that
holders of Exchangeable Shares may participate in each such Offer without
being required to retract Exchangeable Shares as against Exchangeco (or, if so
required, to ensure that any such retraction shall be effective only upon, and
shall be conditional upon, the closing of such Offer and only to the extent
necessary to tender or deposit to the Offer). Nothing herein shall affect the
rights of Exchangeco to redeem, or Vail or Callco to purchase pursuant to the
Redemption Call Right, Exchangeable Shares in the event of a Vail Control
Transaction.

2.9 Vail and Affiliates Not to Vote Exchangeable Shares



Each of Vail and Callco covenants and agrees that it shall appoint and cause
to be appointed proxyholders with respect to all Exchangeable Shares held by
it and its affiliates for the sole purpose of attending each meeting of
holders of Exchangeable Shares in order to be counted as part of the quorum
for each such meeting. Each of Vail and Callco further covenants and agrees
that it shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, exercise any voting
rights which may be exercisable by holders of Exchangeable Shares from time to
time pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or pursuant to the
provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (or any
successor or other corporate statute by which Exchangeco may in the future be
governed) with respect to any Exchangeable Shares held by it or by its
affiliates in respect of any matter considered at any meeting of holders of
Exchangeable Shares; provided however, for further clarity, that this Section
2.8 shall not in any way restrict the right of Vail or any of its affiliates
to vote their common shares of Exchangeco in accordance with the Exchangeable
Share Provisions.

2.10 Ordinary Market Purchases



For greater certainty, nothing contained in this Agreement, including without
limitation the obligations of Vail contained in Section 2.7, shall limit the
ability of Vail (or any of its affiliates) to make ordinary market or other
voluntary purchases of Vail Shares in accordance with applicable laws and
regulatory or stock exchange requirements.

2.11 Ownership of Outstanding Shares



Without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 11(b) of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions, Vail covenants and agrees in favour of
Exchangeco that, as long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares not owned by
Vail or its affiliates are outstanding, Vail will be and remain the direct or
indirect beneficial owner of all issued and outstanding common shares in the
capital of Exchangeco and Callco. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vail shall
not be in violation of this Section 2.11 if any person or group of persons
acting jointly or in concert acquires all or substantially all of the assets
of Vail or the Vail Shares pursuant to any merger or similar transaction
involving Vail pursuant to which Vail is not the surviving corporation. 

2.12 Stock Exchange Listing



Vail covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, as long as any
outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any person other than Vail or any
of its affiliates, Vail shall use reasonable efforts to maintain a listing for
such Exchangeable Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

ARTICLE 3

VAIL SUCCESSORS



3.1 Certain Requirements in Respect of Combination, etc.



So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Vail or its affiliates are
outstanding, Vail shall not enter into any transaction (whether by way of
reorganization, consolidation, arrangement, amalgamation, merger, transfer,
sale, lease or otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking,
property and assets would become the property of any other person or, in the
case of an amalgamation or merger, of the continuing corporation resulting
therefrom, provided that it may do so if:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

such other person or continuing corporation (the "Vail Successor") by
operation of law, becomes, without more, bound by the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or, if not so bound, executes, prior to or contemporaneously
with the consummation of such transaction, an agreement supplemental hereto
and such other instruments (if any) as are necessary or advisable to evidence
the assumption by the Vail Successor of liability for all moneys payable and
property deliverable hereunder and the covenant of such Vail Successor to pay
and deliver or cause to be paid and delivered the same and its agreement to
observe and perform all the covenants and obligations of Vail under this
Agreement; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

such transaction shall be upon such terms and conditions as to preserve and
not to impair any of the rights, duties, powers and authorities of the other
parties hereunder or the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. 

 

3.2 Vesting of Powers in Successor



Whenever the conditions of Section 3.1 have been duly observed and performed,
the parties, if required by Section 3.1, shall execute and deliver the
supplemental agreement provided for in Section 3.1(a) and thereupon the Vail
Successor and such other person that may then be the issuer of the Vail Shares
shall possess and from time to time may exercise each and every right and
power of Vail under this Agreement in the name of Vail or otherwise and any
act or proceeding by any provision of this Agreement required to be done or
performed by the board of directors of Vail or any officers of Vail may be
done and performed with like force and effect by the directors or officers of
such Vail Successor.

3.3 Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries



Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing (a) the amalgamation or merger
of any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Vail (other than
Exchangeco or Callco) with or into Vail, (b) the winding-up, liquidation or
dissolution of any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Vail (other
than Exchangeco or Callco), provided that all of the assets of such subsidiary
are transferred to Vail or another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary
of Vail, (c) any other distribution of the assets of any wholly-owned direct
or indirect subsidiary of Vail among the shareholders of such subsidiary for
the purpose of winding up its affairs, and (d) any such transactions are
expressly permitted by this Article 3.

3.4 Successorship Transaction



Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 3, in the event of a
Vail Control Transaction:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in which Vail merges or amalgamates with, or in which all or substantially all
of the then outstanding Vail Shares are acquired by, one or more other
corporations to which Vail is, immediately before such merger, amalgamation or
acquisition, "related" within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)
(otherwise than by virtue of a right referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b)
thereof); 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

which does not result in an acceleration of the Redemption Date in accordance
with paragraph (ii) of the definition of Redemption Date in the Exchangeable
Share Provisions; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

in which all or substantially all of the then outstanding Vail Shares are
converted into or exchanged for shares or rights to receive such shares (the
"Other Shares") or another corporation (the "Other Corporation") that,
immediately after such Vail Control Transaction, owns or controls, directly or
indirectly, Vail; 

 

then all references herein to "Vail" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be
references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to "Vail Shares"
shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other Shares" (with
appropriate adjustments if any, as are required to result in a holder of
Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of such shares
pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or the Plan of Arrangement or
the exchange of such shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement immediately subsequent to the Vail Control Transaction being
entitled to receive that number of Other Shares equal to the number of Other
Shares such holder of Exchangeable Shares would have received if the exchange,
redemption or retraction of such shares pursuant to the Exchangeable Share
Provisions or the Plan of Arrangement, or the exchange of such shares pursuant
to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement had occurred immediately prior to
the Vail Control Transaction and the Vail Control Transaction was completed)
but subject to subsequent adjustments to reflect any subsequent changes in the
share capital of the issuer of the Other Shares, including without limitation,
any subdivision, consolidation or reduction of share capital, without any need
to amend the terms and conditions of the Exchangeable Shares and without any
further action required.

ARTICLE 4

GENERAL

4.1 Term



This Agreement shall come into force and be effective as of the date hereof
and shall terminate and be of no further force and effect at such time as no
Exchangeable Shares (or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable
for or carrying rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares) are held by any person
other than Vail and any of its affiliates.

4.2 Changes in Capital of Vail and Exchangeco



Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.4, at all times after the
occurrence of any event contemplated pursuant to Section 2.6 and Section 2.7
or otherwise, as a result of which either Vail Shares or the Exchangeable
Shares or both are in any way changed, this Agreement shall forthwith be
amended and modified as necessary in order that it shall apply with full force
and effect, mutatis mutandis, to all new securities into which Vail Shares or
the Exchangeable Shares or both are so changed and the parties hereto shall
execute and deliver an agreement in writing giving effect to and evidencing
such necessary amendments and modifications.

4.3 Severability

hereafter held of record by the Trustee as trustee for and on behalf of, and
for the use and benefit of, the Beneficiaries and in accordance with the

the Trustee shall hold the Special Voting Share and the legal title thereto as
trustee solely for the use and benefit of the Beneficiaries in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement; and

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

to the extent that no instructions are received from a Beneficiary with

of such Voting Rights; and 

 

|

Shares are entitled to vote (each, a "Vail Meeting") and with respect to all
written consents sought by Vail from holders of Vail Shares (each, a "Vail
Consent"), each Beneficiary shall be entitled to instruct the Trustee to cast
and exercise, in the manner instructed, that number of votes equal to the
Equivalent Vote Amount for each Exchangeable Share owned of record by such
Beneficiary at the close of business on the record date established by Vail or
by applicable law for such Vail Meeting or Vail Consent, as the case may be
(collectively, the "Beneficiary Votes"), in respect of each matter, question,
proposal or proposition to be voted on at such Vail Meeting or consented to in
connection with such Vail Consent.

4.3 Mailings to Shareholders

cause to be mailed (or otherwise communicate in the same manner as Vail
utilizes in communications to holders of Vail Shares, subject to applicable
regulatory requirements and to the Trustee being advised in writing of such
manner of communications and provided that such manner of communications is

applicable List on the same day as the mailing (or other communication) with
respect thereto is commenced by Vail to its shareholders:

4.3(1)(d), 4.3(1)(e) and 4.3(1)(f) shall (if reasonably practicable to do so)

the foregoing, Vail shall ensure that the materials to be provided to the

aforesaid and to send all materials to each Beneficiary at the same time as
such materials are first sent to holders of Vail Shares. Vail agrees not to
communicate with holders of Vail Shares with respect to the materials referred

communication is also reasonably available to the Trustee for communication
with the Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vail may, at its
option, exercise the duties of the Trustee to deliver copies of all materials
to all Beneficiaries as required by this Section 4.3 so long as, in each case,
Vail delivers a certificate to the Trustee stating that Vail has undertaken to
perform the obligations of the Trustee set forth in this Section 4.3. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

For the purpose of determining the number of Beneficiary Votes to which a
Beneficiary is entitled in respect of any Vail Meeting or Vail Consent, the
number of Exchangeable Shares owned of record by the Beneficiary shall be
determined at the close of business on the record date established by Vail or
by applicable law for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to vote at
such Vail Meeting or in respect of such Vail Consent. Vail shall notify the
Trustee of any decision of the board of directors of Vail with respect to the
calling of any Vail Meeting or any Vail Consent and shall provide all
necessary information and materials to the Trustee in each case promptly and,
in any event, in sufficient time to enable the Trustee to perform the
obligations of the Trustee set forth in this Section 4.3. 

 

4.4 Copies of Shareholder Information



Vail shall deliver to the Trustee copies of all proxy materials (including,
without limitation, notices of Vail Meetings but excluding proxies to vote
Vail Shares), information statements, reports (including, without limitation,
all interim and annual financial statements) and other written communications
that, in each case, are to be distributed by Vail from time to time to holders
of Vail Shares in sufficient quantities and in sufficient time so as to enable
the Trustee to send or cause to send those materials to each Beneficiary at
the same time as such materials are first sent to holders of Vail Shares. The
Trustee shall mail or otherwise send to each Beneficiary, at the expense of
Vail, copies of all such materials (and all materials specifically directed to
the Beneficiaries or to the Trustee for the benefit of the Beneficiaries by
Vail) received by the Trustee from Vail contemporaneously with the sending of
such materials to holders of Vail Shares. The Trustee shall also make
available for inspection during regular business hours by any Beneficiary at
the Trustee's principal office in Toronto, Ontario all proxy materials,
information statements, reports and other written communications that are:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

received by the Trustee as the registered holder of the Special Voting Share
and made available by Vail generally to the holders of Vail Shares; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

specifically directed to the Beneficiaries or to the Trustee for the benefit
of the Beneficiaries by Vail. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vail may, at its option, exercise the duties of
the Trustee to deliver copies of all such materials to all Beneficiaries as
required by this Section 4.4 so long as, in each case, Vail delivers a
certificate to the Trustee stating that Vail has undertaken to perform the
obligations of the Trustee set forth in this Section 4.4.



4.5 Other Materials



As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by Vail or shareholders of
Vail (if such receipt is known by Vail) of any material sent or given by or on
behalf of a third party to holders of Vail Shares generally, including
dissident proxy and information circulars (and related information and
material) and take-over bid and securities exchange take-over bid circulars
(and related information and material), provided such material has not been
sent to the Beneficiaries by or on behalf of such third party, Vail shall use
its reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to the Trustee copies thereof in
sufficient quantities so as to enable the Trustee to forward such material
(unless the same has been provided directly to Beneficiaries by such third
party) to each Beneficiary as soon as possible thereafter. As soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, the Trustee shall mail or
otherwise send to each Beneficiary, at the expense of Vail, copies of all such
materials received by the Trustee from Vail. The Trustee shall also make
available for inspection during regular business hours by any Beneficiary at
the Trustee's principal office in Toronto, Ontario copies of all such
materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vail may, at its option, exercise
the duties of the Trustee to deliver copies of all such materials to all
Beneficiaries as required by this Section 4.5 so long as, in each case, Vail
delivers a certificate to the Trustee stating that Vail has undertaken to
perform the obligations of the Trustee set forth in this Section 4.5.

4.6 List of Persons Entitled to Vote



Exchangeco shall (a) prior to each annual or other Vail Meeting or the seeking
of any Vail Consent, and (b) forthwith upon each request made at any time by
the Trustee in writing, prepare or cause to be prepared a list (a "List") of
the names and addresses of the Beneficiaries arranged in alphabetical order
and showing the number of Exchangeable Shares held of record by each such
Beneficiary, in each case at the close of business on the date specified by
the Trustee in such request or, in the case of a List prepared in connection
with a Vail Meeting or Vail Consent, at the close of business on the record
date established by Vail or pursuant to applicable law for determining the
holders of Vail Shares entitled to receive notice of and/or to vote at such
Vail Meeting or to give consent in connection with a Vail Consent. Each such
List shall be delivered to the Trustee promptly after receipt by Exchangeco of
such request or the record date for such meeting or seeking of consent, as the
case may be, and, in any event, within sufficient time as to permit the
Trustee to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Vail agrees to give
Exchangeco notice (with a copy to the Trustee) of the calling of any Vail
Meeting or the seeking of any Vail Consent, together with the record date
therefor, sufficiently prior to the date of the calling of such meeting or
seeking of such consent, so as to enable Exchangeco to perform its obligations
under this Section 4.6.

4.7 Entitlement to Direct Votes



Subject to Section 4.8 and Section 4.11, any Beneficiary named in a List
prepared in connection with any Vail Meeting or Vail Consent shall be entitled
to (a) instruct the Trustee in the manner described in Section 4.2 with
respect to the exercise of the Beneficiary Votes to which such Beneficiary is
entitled, (b) attend such meeting and personally exercise thereat (or to
exercise with respect to any written consent), as the proxy of the Trustee,
the Beneficiary Votes to which such Beneficiary is entitled, or (c) appoint a
third party as the proxy of the Trustee to attend such meeting and exercise
thereat the Beneficiary Votes to which such Beneficiary is entitled except, in
each case, to the extent that such Beneficiary has transferred the ownership
of any Exchangeable Shares in respect of which such Beneficiary is entitled to
Beneficiary Votes after the close of business on the record date for such
meeting or seeking of consent.

4.8 Voting by Trustee and Attendance of Trustee Representative at Meeting



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

In connection with each Vail Meeting and Vail Consent, the Trustee shall
exercise, either in person or by proxy, in accordance with the instructions
received from a Beneficiary pursuant to Section 4.2, the Beneficiary Votes as
to which such Beneficiary is entitled to direct the vote (or any lesser number
thereof as may be set forth in the instructions) other than any Beneficiary
Votes that are the subject of Section 4.8(2); provided, however, that such
written instructions are received by the Trustee from the Beneficiary prior to
the time and date fixed by the Trustee for receipt of such instruction in the
notice given by the Trustee to the Beneficiary pursuant to Section 4.3. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

To the extent so instructed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Trustee shall cause a representative who is empowered by it to sign and
deliver, on behalf of the Trustee, proxies for Voting Rights enabling a
Beneficiary to attend a Vail Meeting. Upon submission by a Beneficiary (or its
designee) named in the List prepared in connection with the relevant meeting
of identification satisfactory to the Trustee's representative, and at the
Beneficiary's request, such representative shall sign and deliver to such
Beneficiary (or its designee) a proxy to exercise personally the Beneficiary
Votes as to which such Beneficiary is otherwise entitled hereunder to direct
the vote, if such Beneficiary either (i) has not previously given the Trustee
instructions pursuant to Section 4.3 in respect of such meeting or (ii)
submits to such representative written revocation of any such previous
instructions. At such meeting, the Beneficiary (or its designee) exercising
such Beneficiary Votes in accordance with such proxy shall have the same
rights in respect of such Beneficiary 

Votes as the Trustee to speak at the meeting in favour of any matter,
question, proposal or proposition, to vote by way of ballot at the meeting in
respect of any matter, question, proposal or proposition, and to vote at such
meeting by way of a show of hands in respect of any matter, question, proposal
or proposition.



4.9 Distribution of Written Materials



Any written materials distributed by the Trustee to the Beneficiaries pursuant
to this Agreement shall be sent by mail (or otherwise communicated in the same
manner as Vail utilizes in communications to holders of Vail Shares subject to
applicable regulatory requirements and to the Trustee being advised in writing
of such manner and provided such manner of communications is reasonably
available to the Trustee) to each Beneficiary at its address as shown on the
register of holders of Exchangeable Shares maintained by the registrar. In
connection with each such distribution, Exchangeco shall provide or cause to
be provided to the Trustee for purposes of communication, on a timely basis
and without charge or other expense, a current List, and upon the request of
the Trustee, mailing labels to enable the Trustee to carry out its duties
under this Agreement. Exchangeco's obligations under this Section 4.9 shall be
deemed satisfied to the extent Vail exercises its option to perform the duties
of the Trustee to deliver copies of materials to each Beneficiary and
Exchangeco provides the required information and materials to Vail.

Except as otherwise provided in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, all of the
rights of a Beneficiary with respect to the Beneficiary Votes exercisable in
respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary, including the
right to instruct the Trustee as to the voting of or to vote personally such
Beneficiary Votes, shall lapse and be deemed to be surrendered by the
Beneficiary to Vail or Callco, as the case may be, and such Beneficiary Votes
and the Voting Rights represented thereby shall cease immediately upon:

|

such Exchangeable Shares in connection with the exercise by the Beneficiary of
the Exchange Right; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the occurrence of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Vail

delivery to the Beneficiaries); 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 6 or 7
of the Exchangeable Share Provisions;

upon the purchase of Exchangeable Shares from the holder thereof by Vail or
Callco, as the case may be, pursuant to the exercise by Vail or Callco of the
Liquidation Call Right, the Redemption Call Right, the Change of Law Call
Right or the Retraction Call Right (unless, in any case, Vail or Callco, as
the case may be, shall not have delivered the requisite consideration
deliverable in exchange therefor). 

 

4.11 Disclosure of Interest in Exchangeable Shares



The Trustee or Exchangeco shall be entitled to require any Beneficiary or any
person whom the Trustee or Exchangeco, as the case may be, knows or has
reasonable cause to believe holds any interest whatsoever in an Exchangeable
Share to (a) confirm that fact, or (b) give such details as to whom has an
interest in such Exchangeable Share, in each case as would be required (if the
Exchangeable Shares were a class of "equity securities" of Exchangeco) under
Section 5.2 of National Instrument 62-104 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids or as
would be required under the articles of Vail or any laws or regulations, or
pursuant to the rules or regulations of any regulatory agency, if and only to
the extent that the Exchangeable Shares were Vail Shares. If a Beneficiary
does not provide the information required to be provided by such Beneficiary
pursuant to this Section 4.11, the board of directors of Vail may take any
action permitted under the articles or by-laws of Vail or any laws or
regulations, or pursuant to the rules or regulations of any regulatory agency,
with respect to the Voting Rights relating to the Exchangeable Shares held by
such Beneficiary as if, and only to that the extent that, the Exchangeable
Shares were Vail Shares. 

ARTICLE 5

EXCHANGE AND AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE



5.1 Grant and Ownership of the Exchange Right and Automatic Exchange Right



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Vail and, in the case of the Exchange Right, Callco hereby grant to the
Trustee as trustee for and on behalf of, and for the use and benefit of, the
Beneficiaries (i) the right (the "Exchange Right"), upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Insolvency Event, to require Vail or Callco to
purchase from each or any Beneficiary all or any part of the Exchangeable
Shares held by such Beneficiary, all in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, and (ii) the Automatic Exchange Right. Each of Vail and Callco
hereby acknowledges receipt from the Trustee as trustee for and on behalf of
the Beneficiaries of good and valuable consideration (and the adequacy
thereof) for the grant of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right
by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, to the Trustee. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

During the term of the Trust, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Trustee shall possess and be vested with full legal ownership
of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right and shall be entitled
to exercise all of the rights and powers of an owner with respect to the
Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right, provided that the Trustee
shall: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

hold the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Right and the legal title
thereto as trustee solely for the use and benefit of the Beneficiaries in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

except as specifically authorized by this Agreement, have no power or
authority to exercise or otherwise deal in or with the Exchange Right or the
Automatic Exchange Right, and the Trustee shall not exercise any such rights
for any purpose other than the purposes for which the Trust is created
pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

5.2 Legended Share Certificates



Exchangeco shall cause each certificate representing Exchangeable Shares to
bear a legend notifying the Beneficiary in respect of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by such certificate of (a) his, her or its right to instruct the
Trustee with respect to the exercise of the Exchange Right in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary and (b) the Automatic Exchange
Right.

5.3 General Exercise of Exchange Right



The Exchange Right shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by the
Trustee. Subject to Section 6.15, the Trustee shall exercise the Exchange
Right only on the basis of instructions received pursuant to this Article 5
from Beneficiaries entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the exercise
thereof. To the extent that no instructions are received from any Beneficiary
with respect to the Exchange Right, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit
the exercise of the Exchange Right.

5.4 Purchase Price



The purchase price payable by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, for each
Exchangeable Share to be purchased by Vail or Callco, as the case may be,
pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Right shall be an amount per share
equal to the Exchangeable Share Price on the last Business Day prior to the
day of the closing of the purchase and sale of such Exchangeable Share
pursuant to such exercise of the Exchange Right, which price may be satisfied
only by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, delivering or causing to be
delivered to the Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Beneficiary, the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing such Exchangeable Share Price.
In connection with each exercise of the Exchange Right, Vail or Callco, as the
case may be, shall provide to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate setting
forth the calculation of the Exchangeable Share Price. Upon payment by Vail or
Callco, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Share Price, the relevant
Beneficiary shall cease to have any right to be paid any amount in respect of
declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share by Exchangeco
and Exchangeco shall cease to be obligated to pay any amount in respect of
such dividends.

5.5 Exercise Instructions



Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, a Beneficiary shall be
entitled upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Insolvency
Event, to instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to
all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such
Beneficiary. In order to cause the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with
respect to all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name
of a Beneficiary, such Beneficiary shall deliver to the Trustee, in person or
by certified or registered mail, at its principal office in Toronto, Ontario
or at such other place as the Trustee may from 

time to time designate by written notice to the Beneficiaries, the
certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which such Beneficiary
desires Vail or Callco to purchase, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, and
accompanied by such other documents and instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer of the Exchangeable Shares under the Business Corporations
Act (British Columbia), the articles of Exchangeco and such additional
documents and instruments as Vail, Exchangeco or the Trustee may reasonably
require together with:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right, contained
on the reverse of or attached to the Exchangeable Share certificates, stating
(i) that the Beneficiary thereby instructs the Trustee to exercise the
Exchange Right so as to require Vail or Callco to purchase from the
Beneficiary the number of Exchangeable Shares specified therein, (ii) that
such Beneficiary has good title to and owns all such Exchangeable Shares to be
acquired by Vail or Callco free and clear of all liens, claims, security
interests and encumbrances, (iii) the names in which the certificates
representing Vail Shares issuable in connection with the exercise of the
Exchange Right are to be issued, and (iv) the names and addresses of the
persons to whom such new certificates should be delivered; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

payment (or evidence satisfactory to Vail, Exchangeco and the Trustee of
payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.8 of this
Agreement; 

 

provided that if only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any
certificate or certificates delivered to the Trustee are to be purchased by
Vail or Callco pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Right, a new
certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the
holder at the expense of Exchangeco.

5.6 Delivery of Vail Shares; Effect of Exercise



Promptly after the receipt by the Trustee of the certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares which a Beneficiary desires Vail or Callco to purchase
pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Right, together with a notice of
exercise and such other documents and instruments specified by Section 5.5,
the Trustee shall notify Vail, Callco and Exchangeco of its receipt of the
same, which notice to Vail, Callco and Exchangeco shall constitute exercise of
the Exchange Right by the Trustee on behalf of such Beneficiary in respect of
such Exchangeable Shares, and Vail or Callco, as the case may be, shall
promptly thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, for
delivery to such Beneficiary (or to such other persons, if any, properly
designated by such Beneficiary) the Exchangeable Share Consideration
deliverable in connection with such exercise of the Exchange Right; provided,
however, that no such delivery shall be made unless and until the Beneficiary
requesting the same shall have paid (or provided evidence satisfactory to
Vail, Callco, Exchangeco and the Trustee of the payment of) the taxes (if any)
payable as contemplated by Section 5.7 of this Agreement. Immediately upon the
giving of notice by the Trustee to Vail, Callco and Exchangeco of any exercise
of the Exchange Right, as provided in this Section 5.6, the closing of the
transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the Exchange Right shall be
deemed to have occurred, and the Beneficiary in respect of such Exchangeable
Shares shall be deemed to have transferred to Vail or Callco, as the case may
be, all of such Beneficiary's right, title and interest in and to such
Exchangeable Shares and in the related interest in the Trust Estate and shall
cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the
right to receive the total Exchangeable Share Consideration in respect of such
Exchangeable Shares, unless such Exchangeable Share Consideration is not
delivered by Vail or Callco, as the case may be, to the Trustee for delivery
to such Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any, properly designated by
such Beneficiary) within five Business Days of the date of the giving of such
notice by the Trustee, in which case the rights of the Beneficiary shall
remain unaffected until such Exchangeable Share Consideration is so delivered.
Upon delivery of such Exchangeable Share Consideration to the Trustee, the
Trustee shall promptly deliver such Exchangeable Share Consideration to such
Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any, properly designated by such
Beneficiary). Concurrently with the closing of the transaction of purchase and
sale contemplated by such exercise of the Exchange Right, the Beneficiary
shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Vail
Shares delivered to it pursuant to such exercise of the Exchange Right.

5.7 Exercise of Exchange Right Subsequent to Retraction



In the event that a Beneficiary has exercised its retraction right under
Section 6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions to require Exchangeco to redeem
any or all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the "Retracted
Shares") and is notified by Exchangeco pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions that Exchangeco will not be permitted as a
result of solvency requirements of applicable law to redeem all such Retracted
Shares, subject to receipt by the Trustee of written notice to that effect
from Exchangeco, and provided that neither Vail nor Callco shall have
exercised its Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares and
that the Beneficiary shall not have revoked the retraction request delivered
by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco pursuant to Section 6(a)(iv) of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions, the retraction request will constitute and will
be deemed to constitute notice from the Beneficiary to the Trustee instructing
the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to those Retracted
Shares that Exchangeco is unable to redeem. In any such event, Exchangeco
hereby agrees with the 

Trustee, and in favour of the Beneficiary, promptly to notify the Trustee of
such prohibition against Exchangeco and to forward or cause to be forwarded to
the Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco
or to the Transfer Agent in connection with such proposed redemption of the
Retracted Shares and the Trustee will thereupon exercise the Exchange Right
with respect to the Retracted Shares that Exchangeco is not permitted to
redeem and will require Vail or, at the option of Vail, Callco to purchase
such shares in accordance with the provisions of this Article 5.

5.8 Stamp or Other Transfer Taxes



Upon any sale or transfer of Exchangeable Shares to Vail pursuant to the
exercise of the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Right, the share
certificate or certificates representing the Vail Shares to be delivered in
connection with the payment of the purchase price therefor shall be issued in
the name of the Beneficiary in respect of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or
transferred or in such names as such Beneficiary may otherwise direct in
writing without charge to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or
transferred; provided, however, that such Beneficiary (a) shall pay (and none
of Vail, Callco, Exchangeco or the Trustee shall be required to pay) any
documentary, stamp, transfer of other taxes or duties that may be payable in
respect of any sale or transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of such
shares to a person other than such Beneficiary including, without limitation,
in the event that Exchangeable Shares are being delivered, sold or transferred
in the name of a clearing service or depositary or a nominee thereof, or (b)
shall have evidenced to the satisfaction of Vail, Callco, Exchangeco and the
Trustee that such taxes or duties (if any) have been paid.

5.9 Notice of Insolvency Event



As soon as practicable following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event or any
event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would be
an Insolvency Event, Vail and Exchangeco shall give written notice thereof to
the Trustee. As soon as practicable after receiving notice from Vail or
Exchangeco of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or upon the Trustee
otherwise becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the Trustee shall mail to
each Beneficiary, at the expense of Vail (such funds to be received in
advance), a notice of such Insolvency Event in the form provided by Vail,
which notice shall contain a brief statement of the rights of the
Beneficiaries with respect to the Exchange Right.

5.10 U.S. Securities Law Compliance and Listing of Vail Shares



Vail covenants and agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) file a registration statement (the "Registration Statement") on
Form S-3 (or any successor form) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "1933 Act") to register any and all of the Vail Shares to be
issued or delivered to holders of the Exchangeable Shares by Vail or Callco
(including, for greater certainty, pursuant to the Exchange Right or the
Automatic Exchange Right), (b) cause the Registration Statement to become
effective prior to the time that any Exchangeable Shares are first issued, and
(c) cause the Registration Statement (or a successor registration statement)
to remain effective at all times that any Exchangeable Shares remain
outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Vail and Callco
each covenant and agree that it will take all such actions and do all such
things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to make such filings and seek
such regulatory consents and approvals as are necessary so that the Vail
Shares to be issued or delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares by Vail or
Callco pursuant to the terms of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the Support
Agreement and this Agreement will be offered, sold, issued and delivered in
compliance with the 1933 Act and all applicable state securities laws, and
applicable securities laws in Canada and will use commercially reasonably
efforts to ensure that the Vail Shares will not be "restricted securities"
within the meaning of Rule 144 under the 1933 Act or subject to any "hold
period" resale restriction under National Instrument 45-102 Resale of
Securities. Vail will in good faith expeditiously take all such actions and do
all such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to cause all Vail
Shares to be delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the terms
of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the Support Agreement and this Agreement
to be listed, quoted and posted for trading on all stock exchanges and
quotation systems on which outstanding Vail Shares have been listed by Vail
and remain listed and are quoted or posted for trading at such time.

5.11 Vail Shares



Vail hereby represents, warrants and covenants that the Vail Shares
deliverable as described herein will be duly authorized and validly issued as
fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance.

5.12 Automatic Exchange on Liquidation of Vail



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Vail shall give the Trustee written notice of each of the following events
(each, a "Liquidation Event") at the time set forth below: 

 



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in the event of any determination by the board of directors of Vail to
institute voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up proceedings with
respect to Vail or to effect any other distribution of assets of Vail among
its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at least 30 days
prior to the proposed effective date of such liquidation, dissolution,
winding-up or other distribution; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

as soon as practicable following the earlier of (A) receipt by Vail of notice
of, and (B) Vail otherwise becoming aware of any instituted claim, suit,
petition or other proceedings with respect to the involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of Vail or to effect any other distribution of
assets of Vail among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs, in each case where Vail has failed to contest in good faith any such
proceeding commenced in respect of Vail within 30 days of becoming aware
thereof. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

As soon as practicable following receipt by the Trustee from Vail of notice of
a Liquidation Event, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the
Beneficiaries. Such notice shall be provided by Vail to the Trustee and shall
include a brief description of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares
for Vail Shares provided for in Section 5.12(3) (the "Automatic Exchange
Right"). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

In order that the Beneficiaries will be able to participate on a pro rata
basis with the holders of Vail Shares in the distribution of assets of Vail in
connection with a Liquidation Event, immediately prior to the effective date
(the "Liquidation Event Effective Date") of a Liquidation Event, each of the
then outstanding Exchangeable Shares (other than Exchangeable Shares held by
Vail and its affiliates) shall be automatically exchanged for one Vail Share.
To effect such automatic exchange, Vail shall purchase each such Exchangeable
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date,
and each Beneficiary shall sell each Exchangeable Shares held by it at such
time, free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance, for a purchase price
per share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price immediately prior to the
Liquidation Event Effective Date, which price shall be satisfied in full by
Vail delivering to such holder the Exchangeable Share Consideration
representing such Exchangeable Share Price. For greater certainty, the
Beneficiary shall upon delivery of the Exchangeable Share Consideration cease
to have any rights to be paid by Exchangeco any amount in respect of declared
and unpaid dividends on the Exchangeable Shares. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

The closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by any
exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right shall be deemed to have occurred at
the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Liquidation
Event Effective Date, and each Beneficiary shall be deemed to have transferred
to Vail all of such Beneficiary's right, title and interest in and to the
Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance and the related interest in the Trust Estate, any right of each
such Beneficiary to receive declared and unpaid dividends from Exchangeco
shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged, and each such Beneficiary
shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and Vail shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, for delivery to such Beneficiary, the
Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable to such Beneficiary upon such
exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right. Concurrently with each such
Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, such Beneficiary
shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Vail
Shares included in the Exchangeable Share Consideration to be delivered to
such Beneficiary and the certificates held by such Beneficiary previously
representing the Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the Beneficiary with Vail
pursuant to the exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right shall thereafter be
deemed to represent the Vail Shares issued to such Beneficiary by Vail
pursuant to the exercise of the Automatic Exchange Right. Upon the request of
any Beneficiary and the surrender by such Beneficiary of Exchangeable Share
certificates deemed to represent Vail Shares, duly endorsed in blank and
accompanied by such instruments of transfer as Vail may reasonably require,
Vail shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such Beneficiary certificates
representing the Vail Shares of which the Beneficiary is the holder. 

 

5.13 Withholding Rights



Vail, Callco, Exchangeco and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any dividend, distribution, price or other consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Exchangeable Shares or
Vail Shares such amounts as Vail, Callco, Exchangeco or the Trustee is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Income
Tax Act (Canada) or United States tax laws or any provision of federal,
provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax Law, in each case as
amended or succeeded. The Trustee may act and rely on the advice of counsel
with respect to such matters. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid
to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate taxing agency. To the extent that the amount so required to be
deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of
the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Vail, Callco, Exchangeco
and the Trustee are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such
portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to
Vail, Callco, Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to
comply with such deduction or withholding requirement 

and Vail, Callco, Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case may be, shall notify
the holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net
proceeds of such sale.

5.14 No Fractional Shares



A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall not be entitled to any fraction of a
Vail Share upon the exercise of the Exchange Right or Automatic Exchange Right
hereunder and no certificates representing any such fractional interest shall
be issued and such holder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest shall be
entitled to receive for such fractional interest from the Company, Vail or
Callco, as the case may be, a cash payment equal to such fractional interest
multiplied by the Current Market Price.

or resolution containing such direction or request shall have been delivered
to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be empowered to act upon any such copy

be in non-compliance with any applicable anti-money laundering or anti-
terrorist legislation or regulation. Further, should the Trustee, in its sole
judgment, determine at any time that its acting under this Agreement has
resulted in its being in non-compliance with any applicable anti-money
laundering or anti-terrorist legislation or regulation, then it shall have the
right to resign on fifteen days written notice to the other parties to this
Agreement, provided that (a) the Trustee's written notice shall describe the

the business of a trust company in each of the provinces and territories of
Canada but if, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.14, it ceases
to be so authorized to carry on business, the validity and enforceability of
this Agreement and the Voting Rights, the Exchange Right and the Automatic
Exchange Right and the other rights granted in or resulting from the Trustee
being a party to this Agreement shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever

6.15 Conflicting Claims



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

If conflicting claims or demands are made or asserted with respect to any
interest of any Beneficiary in any Exchangeable Shares, including any
disagreement between the heirs, representatives, successors or assigns
succeeding to all or any part of the interest of any Beneficiary in any
Exchangeable Shares, resulting in conflicting claims or demands being made in
connection with such interest, then the Trustee shall be entitled, in its sole
discretion, to refuse to recognize or to comply with any such claims or
demands. In so refusing, the Trustee may elect not to exercise any Voting
Rights, Exchange Right, Automatic Exchange Right or other rights subject to
such conflicting claims or demands and, in so doing, the Trustee shall not be
or become liable to any person on account of such election or its failure or
refusal to comply with any such conflicting claims or demands. The Trustee
shall be entitled to continue to refrain from acting and to refuse to act
until: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the rights of all adverse claimants with respect to the Voting Rights,
Exchange Right, Automatic Exchange Right or other rights subject to such
conflicting claims or demands have been adjudicated by a final judgement of a
court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have expired; or 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

all differences with respect to the Voting Rights, Exchange Right, Automatic
Exchange Right or other rights subject to such conflicting claims or demands
have been conclusively settled by a valid written agreement binding on all
such adverse claimants, and the Trustee shall have been furnished with an
executed copy of such agreement certified to be in full force and effect. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

If the Trustee elects to recognize any claim or comply with any demand made by
any such adverse claimant, it may in its discretion require such claimant to
furnish such surety bond or other security satisfactory to the Trustee as it
shall deem appropriate to fully indemnify it as between all conflicting claims
or demands. 

 

6.16 Acceptance of Trust



The Trustee hereby accepts the Trust created and provided for, by and in this
Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein
set forth and to hold all rights, privileges and benefits conferred hereby and
by law in trust for the various persons who shall from time to time be
Beneficiaries, subject to all the terms and conditions herein set forth.

6.17 Third Party Interests



Each party to this Agreement hereby represents to the Trustee that any account
to be opened by, or interest to be held by the Trustee in connection with this
Agreement, for or to the credit of such party, either (a) is not intended to
be used by or on behalf of any third party, or (b) is intended to be used by
or on behalf of a third party, in which case such party hereto agrees to
complete and execute forthwith a declaration in the Trustee's prescribed form
as to the particulars of such third party. 

6.18 Privacy



The parties acknowledge that Canadian federal and/or provincial legislation
that addresses the protection of individuals' personal information
(collectively, "Privacy Laws") applies to obligations and activities under
this Agreement. Despite any other provision of this Agreement, no party shall
take or direct any action that would contravene, or cause the others to
contravene, applicable Privacy Laws. The parties shall, prior to transferring
or causing to be transferred personal information to the Trustee, obtain and
retain required consents of the relevant individuals to the collection, use
and disclosure of their personal information, or shall have determined that
such consents either have previously been given upon which the parties can
rely or are not required under the Privacy Laws. Specifically, the Trustee
agrees (a) to have a designated chief privacy officer, (b) to maintain
policies and procedures to protect personal information and to receive and
respond to any privacy complaint or inquiry, (c) to use personal information
solely for the purposes of providing its services under or ancillary to this
Agreement and not to use it for any purpose except with the consent of or
direction from the other parties or the individual involved, (d) not to sell
or otherwise improperly disclose personal information to any third party, and
(e) to employ administrative, physical and technological safeguards to
reasonably secure and protect personal information against loss, theft, or
unauthorized access, use or modification.

ARTICLE 7

COMPENSATION



7.1 Fees and Expenses of the Trustee



Vail, Callco and Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to pay the Trustee
reasonable compensation for all of the services rendered by it under this
Agreement and shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable expenses
(including, but not limited to, taxes (other than taxes based on the net
income or capital of the Trustee), fees paid to legal counsel and other
experts and advisors and agents and travel expenses) and disbursements,
including the reasonable cost and expense of any suit or litigation of any
character and any proceedings before any governmental agency, in each case
reasonably incurred by the Trustee in connection with its duties under this
Agreement; provided, however, that Vail, Callco and Exchangeco shall have no
obligation to reimburse the Trustee for any expenses or disbursements paid,
incurred or suffered by the Trustee in any suit or litigation or any such
proceedings in which the Trustee is determined to have acted in bad faith or
with fraud, gross negligence, recklessness or wilful misconduct.

ARTICLE 8

INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY



8.1 Indemnification of the Trustee



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Vail, Callco and Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Trustee and each of its directors, officers, employees and agents
appointed and acting in accordance with this Agreement (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all claims, losses, damages, reasonable costs,
penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable expenses of the
Trustee's legal counsel) which, without bad faith, fraud, gross negligence,
recklessness or wilful misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party, may
be paid, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party by reason or as a
result of the Trustee's acceptance or administration of the Trust, its
compliance with its duties set forth in this Agreement, or any written or oral
instruction delivered to the Trustee by Vail, Callco or Exchangeco pursuant
hereto. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

The Trustee shall promptly notify Vail, Callco and Exchangeco of a claim or of
any action commenced against any Indemnified Parties promptly after the
Trustee or any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received written
assertion of such a claim or action or have been served with a summons or
other first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the
claim or action; provided, however, that the omission to so notify Vail,
Callco or Exchangeco shall not relieve Vail, Callco or Exchangeco of any
liability which any of them may have to any Indemnified Party except to the
extent that any such delay prejudices the defence of any such claim or action
or results in any increase in the liability which Vail, Callco or Exchangeco
have under this indemnity. Subject to (ii) below, Vail, Callco and Exchangeco
shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence and, if
Vail, Callco and Exchangeco so elect at any time after receipt of such notice,
either of them may assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce any such
claim. The Trustee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
suit and participate in the defence thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Trustee unless (i) the employment of
such counsel has been authorized by Vail, Callco or Exchangeco, or (ii) the
named parties to any such suit include both the Trustee and Vail, Callco or
Exchangeco and the Trustee shall have been advised by counsel acceptable to
Vail, Callco and Exchangeco that there may be one or more legal defences
available to the Trustee that are different from or in addition to those
available to Vail, Callco or Exchangeco and that, in the judgement of such
counsel, would present a conflict of interest were a joint representation to
be undertaken (in which case Vail, Callco and Exchangeco shall not have the
right to assume the defence 

of such suit on behalf of the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall
survive the termination of the Trust and the resignation or removal of the
Trustee.



8.2 Limitation of Liability



The Trustee shall not be held liable for any loss which may occur by reason of
depreciation of the value of any part of the Trust Estate or any loss incurred
on any investment of funds pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent
that such loss is attributable to the bad faith, fraud, gross negligence,
recklessness or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee.

ARTICLE 9

CHANGE OF TRUSTEE



9.1 Resignation



The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign by
giving written notice of such resignation to Vail, Callco and Exchangeco
specifying the date on which it desires to resign, provided that such notice
shall not be given less than 30 days before such desired resignation date
unless Vail, Callco and Exchangeco otherwise agree and provided further that
such resignation shall not take effect until the date of the appointment of a
successor trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by the successor
trustee. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, Vail, Callco and
Exchangeco shall promptly appoint a successor trustee, which successor trustee
shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Canada and
authorized to carry on the business of a trust company in all provinces and
territories of Canada, by written instrument in duplicate, one copy of which
shall be delivered to the resigning trustee and one copy to the successor
trustee. Failing the appointment and acceptance of a successor trustee, a
successor trustee may be appointed by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction upon application of one or more of the parties to this Agreement.
If the retiring trustee is the party initiating an application for the
appointment of a successor trustee by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, Vail, Callco and Exchangeco shall be jointly and severally
liable to reimburse the retiring trustee for its legal costs and expenses in
connection with same.

9.2 Removal



The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may (provided a successor
trustee is appointed) be removed at any time on not less than 30 days' prior
notice by written instrument executed by Vail, Callco and Exchangeco, in
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and
one copy to the successor trustee, provided that such removal shall not take
effect until the date of acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee.

9.3 Successor Trustee



Any successor trustee appointed as provided under this Agreement shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Vail, Callco and Exchangeco and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment. Thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and
such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor under this Agreement, with the like effect as if originally named
as trustee in this Agreement. However, on the written request of Vail, Callco
and Exchangeco or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall,
upon payment of any amounts then due to it pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon the
request of any such successor trustee, Vail, Callco, Exchangeco and such
predecessor trustee shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more
fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all
such rights and powers.

9.4 Notice of Successor Trustee



Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided herein,
Vail, Callco and Exchangeco shall cause to be mailed notice of the succession
of such trustee hereunder to each Beneficiary specified in a List. If Vail,
Callco or Exchangeco shall fail to cause such notice to be mailed within ten
days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor
trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of Vail, Callco
and Exchangeco. 

ARTICLE 10

VAIL SUCCESSORS



10.1 Certain Requirements in Respect of Combination, etc.



So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Vail or its affiliates are
outstanding, Vail shall not enter into any transaction (whether by way of
reorganization, consolidation, arrangement, amalgamation, merger, transfer,
sale for otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking,
property and assets would become the property of any other person or, in the
case of an amalgamation or merger, of the continuing corporation resulting
therefrom, provided that it may do so if:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

such other person or continuing corporation (the "Vail Successor"), by
operation of law, becomes, without more, bound by the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or, if not so bound, executes, prior to or contemporaneously
with the consummation of such transaction, a trust agreement supplemental
hereto and such other instruments (if any) as are necessary or advisable to
evidence the assumption by the Vail Successor of liability for all moneys
payable and property deliverable hereunder and the covenant of such Vail
Successor to pay and deliver or cause to be paid and delivered the same and
its agreement to observe and perform all the covenants and obligations of Vail
under this Agreement; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

such transaction shall be upon such terms and conditions as to substantially
preserve and not impair any of the rights, duties, powers and authorities of
the Trustee or the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. 

 

10.2 Vesting of Powers in Successor



Whenever the conditions of Section 10.1 have been duly observed and performed,
the parties, if required by Section 10.1, shall execute and deliver the
supplemental trust agreement provided for in Section 10.1(a) and thereupon the
Vail Successor and such other person that may then be the issuer of the Vail
Shares shall possess and from time to time may exercise each and every right
and power of Vail under this Agreement in the name of Vail or otherwise and
any act or proceeding by any provision of this Agreement required to be done
or performed by the board of directors of Vail or any officers of Vail may be
done and performed with like force and effect by the directors or officers of
such Vail Successor.

10.3 Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries



Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing (a) the amalgamation or merger
of any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Vail (other than
Exchangeco or Callco) with or into Vail, (b) the winding-up, liquidation or
dissolution of any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Vail (other
than Exchangeco or Callco), provided that all of the assets of such subsidiary
are transferred to Vail or another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary
of Vail, (c) any other distribution of the assets of any wholly-owned direct
or indirect subsidiary of Vail among the shareholders of such subsidiary for
the purpose of winding up its affairs, and (d) any such transactions which are
expressly permitted by this Article 10.

10.4 Successor Transactions



Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 10, in the event of a
Vail Control Transaction:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in which Vail merges or amalgamates with, or in which all or substantially all
of the then outstanding Vail Shares are acquired by, one or more other
corporations to which Vail is, immediately before such merger, amalgamation or
acquisition, "related" within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)
(otherwise than by virtue of a right referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b)
thereof); 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

which does not result in an acceleration of the Redemption Date in accordance
with paragraph (ii) of the definition of Redemption Date in the Exchangeable
Share Provisions; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

in which all or substantially all of the then outstanding Vail Shares are
converted into or exchanged for shares or rights to receive such shares (the
"Other Shares") of another corporation (the "Other Corporation") that,
immediately after such Vail Control Transaction, owns or controls, directly or
indirectly, Vail; 

 

then, (i) all references herein to "Vail" shall thereafter be and be deemed to
be references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to "Vail
Shares" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other Shares"
(with appropriate adjustments, if any, as are required to result in a holder
of Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of such
shares pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or the Plan of
Arrangement or the exchange of such shares pursuant to this Agreement 

immediately subsequent to the Vail Control Transaction being entitled to
receive that number of Other Shares equal to the number of Other Shares such
holder of Exchangeable Shares would have received if the exchange, redemption
or retraction of such shares pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or
the Plan of Arrangement, or the exchange of such shares pursuant to this
Agreement had occurred immediately prior to the Vail Control Transaction and
the Vail Control Transaction was completed) but subject to subsequent
adjustments to reflect any subsequent changes in the share capital of the
issuer of the Other Shares, including without limitation, any subdivision,
consolidation or reduction of share capital, without any need to amend the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and without any further action
required, and (ii) Vail shall cause the Other Corporation to deposit one or
more voting securities of such Other Corporation to allow Beneficiaries to
exercise voting rights in respect of the Other Corporation substantially
similar to those provided for in this Agreement.

related management's discussion and analysis) and the interim unaudited
consolidated financial statements for Whistler for the three and six month
period ended March 31, 2016 (including any notes or schedules thereto and

statements of Whistler (including any notes or schedules thereto and related

periods and all applicable Laws and present fairly, in all material respects,
the assets, liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise),
consolidated financial position and results of operations of Whistler and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and its results of operations
and cash flows for the respective periods covered thereby (except as may be
indicated expressly in the notes thereto). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

There are no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations
(including contingent obligations) or other relationships of Whistler or any
of its Subsidiaries with unconsolidated entities or other Persons. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

The financial books, records and accounts of Whistler and each of its
Subsidiaries: (i) have been maintained, in all material respects, in
accordance with IFRS, and (ii) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for
Whistler's financial statements. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

The management of Whistler has established and maintains a system of
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in National
Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim
Filings) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by Whistler in its annual filings, interim filings or other
reports filed or submitted by it under the applicable Laws imposed by
Governmental Entities is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by such Laws imposed by such Governmental Entities.
Such disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Whistler in
its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under
the applicable Laws imposed by Governmental Entities is accumulated and
communicated to Whistler's management, including its chief executive officer

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

Whistler maintains internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in
Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings). Such internal control over financial
reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with IFRS and includes policies and
procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Whistler and its Subsidiaries; (B) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures of
Whistler and its Subsidiaries are being made only with authorizations of
management and directors of Whistler and its Subsidiaries; and (C) provide

acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Whistler or its Subsidiaries
that could have a material effect on its financial statements. To the

material weaknesses in the design and implementation or maintenance of
internal controls over financial reporting of Whistler that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the ability of Whistler to record, process,
summarize and report financial information; and (y) there is no fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the internal control over financial reporting of Whistler.

plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent
fiscal year.

Benefit Plan which provides pension benefits, superannuation benefits or
retirement savings, including any "registered pension plans" as that term is

None of the Whistler Benefit Plans, or any insurance contract relating
thereto, require or permit a retroactive increase in premiums or payments on
termination of the Whistler Benefit Plan or any insurance contract relating
thereto, except where such increase or payments, individually or in the

conduct of business by Whistler or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted (including following the transaction contemplated by this Agreement)
other than Contracts or Orders which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Whistler Material Adverse Effect. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(bb)

|

Material Contracts. True and complete copies of the Whistler Material
Contracts have been disclosed in the Data Room. Whistler and its Subsidiaries
have performed in all material respects all respective obligations required to
be performed by them to date under the Whistler Material Contracts and neither
Whistler nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or default under
any Whistler Material Contract to which it is a party or bound, nor does
Whistler have knowledge of any condition that with the passage of time or the

or default under) any such Whistler Material Contract by any other party

and arms' length negotiations between the parties thereto. Whistler has not

effect.

Exchangeco. 

| 
---|---

Vail Financing. Vail has delivered to Whistler a true and complete copy of an
executed commitment letter (the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to
which the lenders party thereto have agreed to provide or cause to be provided
the amount of incremental term loans set forth therein (the "Incremental Term
Loans"). The Debt Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and
constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Vail and, to the knowledge
of Vail, the other parties thereto (subject in each case to the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and to general equity principles and subject to
the inclusion of an exclusive jurisdiction of Ontario courts clause contained
therein). No event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or
with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default) by Vail under
the Debt Financing Commitments, or, to the knowledge of Vail, the other
parties thereto. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Incremental Term
Loans, together with Vail's other financial resources, including cash and cash
equivalents on hand, and available revolving borrowing capacity under Vail
Holdings Inc.\'s existing credit facility, will be sufficient to pay the
aggregate cash portion of the Consideration, including payments in lieu of
fractional entitlements to Vail Shares or Exchangeable Shares, pursuant to the
Arrangement. Vail acknowledges and agrees that its obtaining financing is not
a condition to any of its obligations hereunder, regardless of the reasons why
financing is not obtained or whether such reasons are within or beyond the
control of Vail. For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of whether any such
financing is obtained, Vail and Exchangeco will continue to be obligated to
consummate the Arrangement, subject to and on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement.

distribution, or exempt from or not subject to any requirement for
registration or qualification for distribution, under Canadian Securities
Laws, U.S. federal securities laws and the state securities of each U.S. state
where holders entitled to receive such shares are located. Such securities

U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and shall not be subject to any "hold
period" resale restrictions under National Instrument 45-102 - Resale of
Securities of the Securities Authorities.
