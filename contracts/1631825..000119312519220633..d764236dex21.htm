negotiate, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
otherwise to comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

3.3. _Exchange of Common Stock_ _and Paying Fund_ __  

(a) _Paying Agent; Paying Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company of national recognition and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as agent
for the holders of shares of Common Stock to receive the funds to which such
holders shall become entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)_ and shall enter
into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to
the Paying Agents responsibilities under this Agreement. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock cash
sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration to which holders of such
shares shall become entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)_ (excluding
payments with respect to Canceled Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting
Shares) (such aggregate cash, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose, subject to  _Section 3.3(h)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i)
a Certificate whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ (A) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
customary form and contain customary provisions) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and (ii) Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder
of record of one or more Certificates, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, and each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares,
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Book-Entry Shares (which shall be
deemed surrendered upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message"
in customary form or such other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _ 
Section 3.1(b)_, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such

 



-23- 

    

 payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein. No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to
the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by the Company on the shares of Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it
shall be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by, or
otherwise undistributed to, the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable
for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration for satisfaction of
its claim for Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the terms of this _Article III_.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any distributions from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to such date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and
subject to _Section 3.3(d)_, Parent) will issue, or will cause to be issued,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and the making of a
customary indemnity, the payments with respect to such Certificate to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to this  _Article III_.

 



-24- 

    

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent;  _provided_ that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article III_ , and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any interest
or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon
demand.

thereto and as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time
to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section
6.15_, the " _Equity Funding Letter_ ") from the Sponsor pursuant to which
the Sponsor has agreed to make an equity investment in Parent, subject to the
terms and conditions therein, in cash in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "). The Equity Funding Letter provides that
the Company is an express third-party beneficiary of, and is entitled to

to fund the Equity Financing in accordance with and subject to the terms of,
the Equity Funding Letter.

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
a fully executed debt commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter dated the date
of this Agreement from the financial institutions identified therein (together
with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets attached thereto and as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after
the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section 6.15_, collectively,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Funding
Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which such financial
institutions have agreed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing, collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ ").

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters are in full force
and effect and constitute the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable
in accordance with their terms (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions).
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters, other than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing
Letters (such conditions precedent, the " _Financing Conditions_ ").

 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters have not been
amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained
therein have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and
no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by
Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the
Merger, Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing
Conditions will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters will not be available to
Parent on the Closing Date assuming the Financing Conditions are satisfied.

 



-47- 

    

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in default or breach under
the terms and conditions of the Financing Letters and, assuming the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligation to consummate the Merger, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach thereunder on the part of Parent or a
failure to satisfy a Financing Condition therein by Parent.

 

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Redacted Fee Letter,
there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements
relating to the Financing Letters or the Financing to which Parent or any of
its Affiliates is a party that could affect the conditionality, availability
or amount of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters in any
respect. 

(h) Parent or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all
commitment or other fees and amounts required by the Financing Letters to be
paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

(i) The Financing, if and when funded in accordance with the
Financing Letters, will provide Parent and Merger Sub at and as of the
Closing Date with sufficient available funds to consummate the Transactions
and to make all payments required to be made in connection therewith by Parent
or Merger Sub, including (x) the payment of the Merger Consideration required
to be paid on the Closing Date, (y) the repayment of all outstanding debt (and
all premiums and fees payable in connection therewith) required by its terms
to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied
or discharged at the Closing and (z) the payment of all other amounts to be
paid by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, and
associated costs and expenses of the Transactions required to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Agreement or the Financing Letter (such amounts, collectively, the "
_Required Amounts_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters) by
or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

 

(j) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement with the
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Immediately after giving effect to
the Transaction (including any financing in connection with the Transactions),
assuming (x) the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV of this Agreement, (y) the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger,
and (z) the most recent financial forecasts of the Company made available to
Parent by the Company or its Affiliates on or prior to the date hereof were
prepared in good faith upon assumptions that were reasonable at such time (it
being understood that the Company is not making any representation
and warranty with respect thereto as a result of such assumption in this sub-
clause (z)), (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have
incurred indebtedness beyond their ability to pay such indebtedness as it
matures or becomes due, (ii) the then present fair saleable value of the
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

 



-48- 

    

 whole, will exceed the amount that will be required to pay their probable
Liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent Liabilities) and
indebtedness as it becomes absolute or matured, (iii) the assets of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their
probable Liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent
Liabilities) and indebtedness and (iv) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, will not have unreasonably small capital to carry on their businesses
as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted.

 

5.9. _Parent Termination Fee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct
copy of the Termination Fee Commitment Letter. The Termination Fee Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Sponsor, enforceable by the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions). As of
the date of this Agreement, the Sponsor is not in default or breach under the
terms and conditions of the Termination Fee Commitment Letter and no event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default, breach or failure by Sponsor
to satisfy a condition under the terms and conditions of the Termination Fee
Commitment Letter.

 

5.10. _Certain Arrangements_. Other than the Support Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Rollover Agreement and the
Subscription Agreement (i) as of the date of this Agreement, there are no and
(ii) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and until the
earlier of Closing or termination of this Agreement, except pursuant to
_Section 6.1_, there will be no Contracts or other arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written and whether or not legally binding) or
commitments to enter into Contracts or other arrangements or understandings
(whether oral or written and whether or not legally binding) (a) between
Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor or any of their Affiliates (other than any
existing limited partner of the Sponsor or any of their Affiliates), on the
one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Company Board or
any beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock, on the other hand, that relate
to the Company or any of its businesses or Subsidiaries (including those
businesses and Subsidiaries following the Closing) or the
Transactions (including as to continuing employment or equity roll-over) or
(b) pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to
receive value or consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger
Consideration or agrees to vote against or otherwise oppose any Company
Superior Proposal.

5.11. _Ownership of Common Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been at any time during the
last three years, an "interested stockholder" of the Company (in each case, as
such quoted terms are defined under Section 203 of the DGCL). Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub owns any shares of Common Stock.

5.12. _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor any of Parents Subsidiaries
has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement who would be entitled to any fee
or any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

5.13. _Investigation; No Other Representations_ _._ Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, Contracts, Intellectual Property, real estate, technology,
Liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of them acknowledges that it and its
Representatives have received access to certain books and records, facilities,
equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
it and its Representatives have requested to review and that it and its
Representatives have had the opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, except for
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ (as
qualified by the Company Disclosure Letter) or any certificate delivered by
the Company pursuant to this Agreement (a) the Company does not make, or
has not made, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon, any express
or implied representations or warranties relating to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or otherwise, (b) no person has
been authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty
relating to it or its business or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied
upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been authorized by such party, and (c)
any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information,
memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their representatives are not
and shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless
any such materials or information are the subject of any express
representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_ or any certificate
delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, except
for any remedies available under this Agreement with respect to the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ (as
qualified by the Company Disclosure Letter), and the Support Agreement,
neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or other obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives
or Affiliates or any other Person resulting from Parents, Merger Subs or
their Representatives or Affiliates use of any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent, Merger Sub
or their Representatives or Affiliates, including any information made
available in the electronic data room maintained by or on behalf of the
Company or its Representatives for purposes of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, teasers, marketing materials, consulting reports or
materials, confidential information memoranda, management presentations,
functional "break-out" discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf
of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives or in any other
form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13 _is
intended or shall be deemed to have the effect of eliminating, limiting or
restricting in any way any Persons rights or remedies in the event of fraud.

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.1.  _Access to Information, Employees and Facilities_ _._ __

(a) For purposes of furthering the Transactions, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date this Agreement
is terminated (the " _Interim Period_ "), subject to _Section 6.1(b)_ and

give Parent and its Representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the books and records (including personnel

its Subsidiaries, and, during such normal business hours in the Interim
Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make the
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to Parent
and its Representatives and to furnish to Parent all financial, operating and
other data and information, in each case, (i) as Parent shall from time to
time reasonably request, and (ii) to the extent that such access and
disclosure would not obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any actions that would unreasonably interfere with the normal course of their
businesses; _provided_ that this _Section 6.1_ does not authorize
environmental testing or sampling of the Leased Real Property or Owned Real
Property; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall access to the

arrangements without the Companys prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and subject to such parties
providing the Company and its Representatives the opportunity to review any
such proposed arrangements a reasonable period of time prior to the proposed
execution of any such arrangements.

 

(b) Nothing in _Section 6.1(a)_ shall require the Company to provide access
or to disclose any information to the other party or its Representatives if
such access or disclosure, in the reasonable judgment of the Companys legal
counsel, would be in violation of applicable Laws or binding agreements
entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of
this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to result in a loss or
impairment of the protection of any attorney-client or work product privilege;
_provided_ , that in such instances the Company shall inform Parent of the
general nature of the information being withheld and, upon Parents request,
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information, in whole
or in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described
in this sentence. If any of the information or material furnished pursuant to
_Section 6.1(a)_ includes material or information subject to the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege
concerning pending or threatened Litigation or governmental investigations,
each party hereto understands and agrees that the parties hereto have a
commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire,
intention and mutual understanding of the parties hereto that the sharing of
such material or information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or its
continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the
Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to
such protection under these privileges, this Agreement and the joint defense
doctrine.

(c) All such information provided by the Company shall be held in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality
Agreement will remain in full force and effect until Closing and shall
automatically terminate on and with effect from the Closing.

than, in response to an unsolicited inquiry that did not arise from a breach
of  _Section 6.4(b)_ (other than any breach that is both immaterial and
unintentional), solely to ascertain facts from the Person making such Company

including with respect to any amended or modified Company Takeover Proposal
submitted by any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date until
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and the restrictions in this
_Section 6.4(b)_ shall not apply with respect thereto.

in this Agreement, if at any time from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date
and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives
a _bona fide_ written __ Company Takeover Proposal that is not withdrawn from
any Person that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.4(b)_ (other than
any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional), and if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal, and (y) failure to take

Representatives may, in response to such Company Takeover Proposal, (A)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person that has made such written Company Takeover

Effective Time, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in no event later than 24
hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Company
Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal, inquiry or request for information
or discussions relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is or would

the No-Shop Period Start Date, with respect to any other Person), including
the identity of the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal or offer,

Recommendation following the date any Company Takeover Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first published or sent or given to the

request on more than one occasion in respect of any Company Takeover Proposal
or more than one occasion in respect of any material modification of
a Company Takeover Proposal, (D) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 against any Company
Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject
to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business
Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (E) publicly propose
or agree to any of the foregoing (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), or (ii) cause or
direct the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition

to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 6.4(c))_
(a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or publicly propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board may, in response to a Company Superior Proposal received by the
Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
_Section 6.4(b)_ (other than any breach that is both immaterial and
unintentional), (x) make a Change of Recommendation, (y) other than in
connection with a Company Superior Proposal or a Company Takeover Proposal in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, take any action to exempt any
Person from the restrictions of any Takeover Laws (including under Section
203 of the DGCL) or (z) cause the Company to validly terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_; _provided_ that prior to making such
Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least five
(5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
person making any such Company Superior Proposal and contemporaneously
provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any
proposed Company Acquisition Agreement and all related documentation, (B)
during such five (5) Business Day period following the date on which such
notice is received, the Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
Parent may propose, (C) upon the end of such notice period (or such subsequent
notice period as contemplated by clause (D)), the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal, and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial
terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice
period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence ( _provided_ that the
notice period thereunder shall only be three (3) Business Days) during which
time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
Section 6.4(e) anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses
(A) through (D) above of this proviso. For the avoidance of doubt, the Cut-Off
Date shall be tolled and shall not take effect during the periods described in
the foregoing sentence. 

 



-59- 

    

(f) _Change of Recommendation in Response to Intervening Event_. The
foregoing notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may, solely in response to an Intervening Event,
make a Change of Recommendation, if the Company and the Company Board has
complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.4_ , and the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Company Board to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board shall not be entitled to effect such a Change of Recommendation
until (i) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to effect such a Change of
Recommendation and specifying the reasons therefor, which notice shall include
a description the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) during the five (5)
Business Day period following the date on which such notice is received, the
Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith
with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) following the end of
such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board, after consultation with
the Companys independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel and
taking in account any revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent, shall have determined in good faith that the failure of
the Company Board to make such a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company that is required by Law or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.4(g)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Change of
Recommendation other than in accordance with _Section 6.4(e)_ or _Section
6.4(f)_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to limit the
proviso set forth in _Section 6.8_. Any breach by any Representative of the
Company of the provisions of _Section 6.4(b)_ shall be deemed to be, and shall
have all effects as a breach by the Company.

 

6.5. _P_ _roxy Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting_.

Agreement (and in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement in preliminary form, which shall, subject to _Section 6.4_,
include the Recommendation. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments by the SEC staff in
respect of the Proxy Statement and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to

-60- 

    

 that in no event shall the Company be required to mail the Proxy Statement
to holders of Common Stock prior to five Business Days after the No-Shop

and Merger Sub shall exercise reasonable best efforts to furnish all
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and propose
comments on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof (and any
amendments or supplements thereto) or any responses or other communications to
the SEC or its staff and shall in good faith consider such comments
reasonably proposed by Parent for inclusion therein. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to holders of Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable, and in no event more than
five (5) Business Days, after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the Proxy Statement; _provided_ that in no event shall
the Company be required to mail the Proxy Statement to holders of Common Stock
prior to the No-Shop Start Date or, if there are any Excluded Parties, the
Cut-Off Time.

 

(b) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by a party, which information should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and
mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the
extent required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or
supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its
stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all actions required under the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), with the record date and meeting date of
the Company Stockholders Meeting to be selected after reasonable consultation
with Parent, and (ii) subject to a Change of Recommendation pursuant to, and
in accordance with, _Section 6.4_, use all reasonable efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as Parent shall have
otherwise consented to in writing in advance, the adoption of this Agreement
shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters and matters that are
required by the Exchange Act or other applicable Law to be voted on by the
Companys stockholders in connection therewith) which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not in any way limit
the Companys ability to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting simultaneously
with the Companys annual meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting at any time prior to the 20th
Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
the DGCL, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Companys obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting under this Agreement shall not be limited, or
otherwise affected, by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal, and once
established, the Company shall not change the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting or postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) if the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Company
Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, including due to an absence of quorum, then on no more
than one occasion (for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar days)
and prior to the vote contemplated having been taken, the Company shall have
the right to require an adjournment or postponement of the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor
of this Agreement, and (ii) if requested by Parent on no more than one
occasion, the Company shall adjourn, delay or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting, if Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the
Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy tallies
following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders.

Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this
Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance
as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case
of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) with copies
of) all notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party or
any of its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority or any other
information supplied by or on behalf of such party or any of its Affiliates
to, or correspondence with, any Person in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the
other parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties
with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other
parties orally of) any communication from or to any Governmental Authority
regarding the Transactions, and permit the other parties to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such
Governmental Authority. No party or any of its Affiliates shall participate
in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 6.6(b)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be)
or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 6.6_, materials provided pursuant to this _Section 6.6 _may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
the Transactions, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to (subject to it being conditioned on the consummation of the

the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), (ii) create, terminate, or
divest relationships, ventures, Contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Affiliates, and (iii) otherwise take or
commit to take any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with

businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or
the Company (including any of their respective Affiliates). If requested by
Parent, the Company will agree to any action contemplated by this  _Section
6.6_; _provided_ , that any such agreement or action is conditioned on the

will the Company (and the Company will not permit any of its Affiliates to)
propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions without the prior
written consent of Parent.

contained in this _Section 6.6_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Competition
Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

(and shall cause its respective Affiliates to) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the CFIUS Approval and the DCSA Arrangements, and (y) the
Company shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates, to use reasonable

cash incentive opportunities (excluding any equity-based or long-term
incentive opportunities) provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company
in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, and (iii)
other employee benefits (excluding any deferred or long-term incentive
compensation, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation,
post-termination or retiree health or welfare and equity or equity-based
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such employee
benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred
compensation, post-termination or retiree health or welfare and equity or
equity-based benefits) provided under the Company Benefit Plans in which the
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, for the one (1) year period
immediately following the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee with
severance benefits on the terms and conditions and at the levels set forth on

taking into account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to
such Continuing Employee and (y) by taking into account each Continuing
Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
entities) and, after the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Periods of employment of Continuing Employees with the Company or any of
its current or former Affiliates, to the same extent and for the same
purposes as recognized under any comparable Company Benefit Plan of the
Company and its Affiliates, including their predecessor entities, shall be

vesting, and (iii) determining level of benefits of the corresponding
employee benefit plan (excluding any plan providing for defined benefit
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, equity or equity-based
compensation, or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits)
offered by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent to the Continuing Employees during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to recognize such
service to the extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits or
compensation. Additionally, during the applicable plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs, Parent shall, or cause one of its Subsidiaries to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive any pre-existing condition
limitations under all applicable group health care plans of Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent to the extent such condition was satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date and (B)
credit all Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with all
payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums and deductible payments and
co-payments paid by such Person, in each case, under the Company Benefit Plan
providing health insurance during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Closing Date for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
Person has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any health insurance plans of Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent for such plan year.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all
Company Benefit Plans (other than Company Equity Plans and Company ESPP) set
forth on _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance

agreement or arrangement or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from
establishing, amending, modifying or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or
any other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement or from terminating or modifying the employment or engagement of
any Continuing Employee or other service provider. The provisions of this
_Section 6.7_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this

right or any right to employment or continued employment (or any particular
term or condition of employment) for any specified period, or compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right of
any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person under any other
compensation or employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement that such employee or beneficiary or other Person would not
otherwise have under the terms of any such benefit plan without regard to this
Agreement.

(a) From and after the Effective Time for a period of 6 years, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws, as now or hereafter in effect: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the period from
the date hereof through the Effective Time will be, serving as a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who
served as a director, officer member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") in connection with any DandO Claim and
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) relating to or resulting from such DandO Claim (without prejudice to
_Section 6.11_), and (ii) promptly advance to such Covered Person any Claim
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any DandO Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such DandO Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement
to the Covered Person of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Covered Person in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case subject to the Covered Person to whom Claim
Expenses are advanced providing, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Covered Person is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such DandO Claim, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Covered Person in the defense of any such
DandO Claim. All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder
shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
shall inure to the benefit of such Persons heirs, successors, executors and
personal and legal representatives for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time.

 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, limitations
on liability of Covered Persons, indemnification of and advancement of
expenses to Covered Persons than are set forth as of the date hereof in
the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if any DandO Claim (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters
subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.9(b)_
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such DandO Claim.
Following the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the indemnification
Contracts in existence on the date of this Agreement set forth on _Section
6.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with any of the Covered Persons to
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



-68- 

    

(c) At the Companys option and expense, or if Parent requests, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate
premium for) a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy (which policy by
its express terms shall survive the Merger) of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
covered individuals as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing directors
and officers insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time for DandO Claims arising from facts, acts, events
or omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%)
of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ ").
If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain such a tail policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail policy shall not
exceed the Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such tail policy
cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual
premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can
be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all its obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) sell
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then
proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to any Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that each
Covered Person (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be a
third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.9_. In the event of any breach
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this _Section 6.9_, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_ as such fees are incurred,
upon the written request of such Covered Person.

6.10.  _Exchange Delisting; Listing_ _._ Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving

of any litigation brought by any stockholder of the Company or purported
stockholder of the Company against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective directors or officers relating to the Transactions, and
shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at
Parents expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation and
reasonably cooperate with Parent in conducting the defense or settlement of
such litigation, and no such settlement or any disclosure in connection
therewith shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event of,
and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall control.

6.12. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such reasonable steps as may be necessary to cause any dispositions of
Company equity securities pursuant to the Transactions by each individual
(including any Person who is deemed to be a _"_ director by deputization"
under applicable securities Laws) who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such
steps to be taken in accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations and
interpretations of the SEC staff.

6.13. _Takeover Law_. Neither Parent nor the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Law to become
applicable to this Agreement and the Transactions, and each of Parent and the
Company shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from any applicable
Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Law may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and
the Company shall promptly take such reasonable actions as are necessary so

Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms (including the

effect and comply with the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing in a timely and diligent matter, (ii) negotiate and

Merger Sub in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements

 



-70- 

    

 related thereto (including by consummating the Equity Financing at or prior

Equity Funding Letter) (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek
the waiver of conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such
Debt Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements related thereto), (iv)

Subs obligations to consummate the Transactions, consummate the Financing and

date hereof) or (y) agree to or permit any termination of or amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision
under, the Debt Commitment Letter, any related fee letter or the definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing if, in the case of this clause (y),
such termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as
compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement unless the Debt Financing or
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) such that the
aggregate amount of the Financing would be below the amount required to pay
the Required Amounts at the Closing, (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the
Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the
foregoing clauses (A) through (C), collectively, the " _Prohibited Financing
Modifications_ "). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or under any
Financing Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing
promptly upon execution thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 6.15_ shall require, and
in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be
deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (x) seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than the counterparties to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Funding Letter, or (y)
pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity Funding Letter or
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any market "flex" provisions contained
therein).

reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing

default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Letters or definitive documents related to the Financing of which
Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt by Parent or Merger
Sub of any written notice or other

 



-71-

material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between Parent and any Financing Source or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing, in each
case regarding the obligation to fund the Financing in an amount necessary to
fund the Required Amount on the terms and in the manner contemplated by
the Financing Letters, and (iii) of the occurrence of an event or development
that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the
Required Amount on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Financing
Letters. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two
business days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a
written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ that none of Parent or
Merger Sub shall be required to disclose or provide any such information, the
disclosure of which, in the judgement of Parent upon advice of outside
counsel, is subject to attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , that, subject
to not violating attorney-client privilege, Parent or Merger Sub shall
notify the Company of the withholding thereof and use reasonable best efforts
to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information.
If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any applicable market "flex" provisions) contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, in replacement thereof
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to fund the Required Amount with terms and conditions (including
market "flex" provisions) not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (or
their respective Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or on other terms acceptable to Parent, subject to the
Prohibited Financing Modifications). Parent shall deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of the alternative debt commitment letters (including
Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which the same or any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. For
purposes of this Agreement, references to (x) the "Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 6.15_, (y) the
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 6.15_ and (z)

replaced by this _Section 6.15_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by
Parent and Merger Sub with this _Section 6.15_ shall not relieve Parent
or Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable

Merger Subs failure to close as a result of the unavailability of the Debt
Financing (or any alternative financing contemplated by _Section 6.15)_

(i) prior to the Closing, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or
failed to perform any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or

being cured or, if curable, has not been cured, by Parent or Merger Sub prior
to the earlier of the (x) Termination Date and (y) thirtieth (30th) Business

Transactions; or 

(e) By written notice of Parent:

 

(i) prior to the Closing, if the Company shall have breached or failed to

cured, by the Company prior to the earlier of the

of written notice thereof from Parent; provided that Parent or Merger Sub

of Common Stock.

8.3. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement will forthwith become void
and have no further force or effect, without any Liability on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
except as provided in this _Section 8.3_, _Section 6.1(c)_,  _Section
6.8_, _Section 8.2_, and _Article IX_ , which will survive any termination
hereof, and provided that, subject to this _Section 8.3_, none of Parent,

or damages arising out of its fraud or Willful Breach.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_, then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (or its designee), at

wire transfer of immediately available funds; or

 



-80- 

    

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by (x) either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ ( _provided_ that at the time of termination the
Company shall not have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(iii))_ or _Section 8.1(f)_, or (y) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_; (B) a _bona fide_ Company Takeover Proposal shall have
been publicly made, proposed or communicated (or shall have otherwise become
publicly known) after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting
(or, if earlier, prior to the time of termination of this Agreement); and (C)
at any time on or prior to the twelve (12)-month anniversary of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries completes or enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, and thereafter completes, a Company
Takeover Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent
(or its designee) the Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made
promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days from the earliest to
occur of the foregoing events in clause (C), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent; _provided_
that, for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_, all references in the
definition of Company Takeover Proposal to twenty percent (20%) or eighty

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(d) In the event that (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_, or (ii) Parent shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and at such time the
Company is entitled to validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_, then in each such case Parent shall pay
to the Company a termination fee in an amount equal to $80,000,000 (the "
_Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days)
following such termination. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that neither the Company
Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is intended to be a penalty but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is paid, for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party hereto fails to promptly
pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and the other party
commences a suit that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against
the failing party for the amounts set forth in this _Section 8.3_ or a
portion thereof, the failing party shall pay to the other party all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of
enforcement (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees as well as
expenses

 



-81- 

    

 incurred in connection with any such action), together with interest on such
amount or such portion thereof at the prime lending rate as published in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be
made (together, the " _Termination Expenses and Interest_ "); _provided_ that
in no event shall any party be required to pay Termination Expenses and
Interest in the aggregate amount exceeding $3,500,000.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the provisos in  _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 9.6_, in any circumstance in
which this Agreement is terminated and Parent has the right to receive payment
of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, the payment of
the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Termination Expenses and
Interest, shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent Related
Parties against the Company and any of its Non-Party Affiliates (together,
the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result
of the failure of the Transactions or for a breach of, or failure to perform
under, this Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered in
connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, and upon
payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement (except that the Company remains obligated to pay to Parent and
Merger Sub any amount due and payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(f))_, whether
in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except that nothing
shall relieve the Company of its obligations under _Section 6.8_. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.3(g)_ shall limit, abridge or
otherwise modify any Liabilities of the Company pertaining to fraud or a
Willful Breach.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to _Section 9.6_, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches this Agreement (whether
willfully (including a Willful Breach), intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) or fails to perform hereunder (whether willfully (including a
Willful Breach), intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, except
for the right to seek specific performance in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions of _Section 9.6_, the sole and exclusive remedies
(whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent,
Merger Sub, or any of their Non-Party Affiliates (each a " _Parent Related
Party_ ") for any breach (whether willfully (including a Willful Breach),
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), loss, damage or failure to
perform under (whether willfully (including a Willful Breach), intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), this Agreement or any certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any
oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith shall be for the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ and receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to and solely to the extent required by
_Section 8.3(d)_, and, if applicable, the Termination Expenses and Interest,
and upon payment of such amounts, (a) none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement (whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
liability company or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf
of a party or another Person or otherwise) and (b) no Company Related Party
shall be entitled to bring, and in no event support, facilitate or encourage,
the bringing of any Litigation (under any legal theory, whether sounding in
law or in equity (in each case whether for breach of contract, in tort or
otherwise)) 

 



-82- 

    

 against a Parent Related Party with respect to, arising out of, or in
connection with, the failure of the Closing to occur or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder, under the Financing Letters or otherwise (in
any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), and
the Company shall cause any such Litigation pending as of any termination of
this Agreement to be dismissed with prejudice as promptly as practicable
after such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including this _Section 8.3(h))_, if the Parent Termination Fee
and, if applicable, the Termination Expenses and Interest are paid to the
Company, under no circumstances will any Company Related Party, or the Company
Related Parties in the aggregate, be entitled to monetary damages or monetary
remedies for any claims, damages or other losses suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in the
Financing Letters to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or thereunder or for any representation made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, in excess of the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Termination Expenses and
Interest. Under no circumstances shall the collective monetary damages payable
by Parent and the other Parent Related Parties (including the Sponsor) under
this Agreement or the Termination Fee Commitment Letter for non-compliance
with or breaches (in each case, whether knowingly, willfully, intentionally or
unintentionally or otherwise, and including any fraud) under this Agreement
or the Termination Fee Commitment Letter exceed an aggregate amount equal to
the Parent Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 8.3(h)_ shall limit, abridge or otherwise modify (A) any remedies
of the Company pursuant to _Section 9.6_, but subject to the terms therein
and (B) any remedies available to the Company under the Confidentiality
Agreement.

consummate the Merger and effect the Closing. Subject to the following
sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.7(b)_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
(b) the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall not be construed
to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to specific
enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the Transactions and without that right neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with
enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to
fund the Merger Consideration and Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
effect the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall
be subject to the requirements that (i) all conditions in _Sections_ _7.1_ and
_7.2_ have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied at the Closing) at the
Closing and at the time the Company initially institutes such proceeding
Parent and Merger Sub are required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ of the
Merger Agreement, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing at
least three (3) Business Days prior thereto (and not revoked, withdrawn or
modified such confirmation) that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.3_ have been and continue to be satisfied or irrevocably waived and that if
the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing shall
occur pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the
parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law, other than an assertion that
the exercise of specific performance was not effected in accordance with
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction breaches of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may concurrently
seek (x) specific performance or other equitable relief, subject in all
respects to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ and (y) payment of the Parent
Termination Fee if, as and when required pursuant to this Agreement and
subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded at the Closing in accordance with the terms
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ (whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Funding Letter) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee and/or the Termination Expenses and Interest, if any,
as and when due, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, on the other hand.

parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Litigation shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court
judgment.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
other parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any
Litigation against the Financing Sources, in their capacities as such, in any

any Person other than the parties hereto _._

any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement,
any other Transaction Document or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or such other Transaction Document) may be made by any party hereto
only against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto or

Person. No Person who is not a named party to the Transaction Documents

incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate (disregarding

Liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to the Transaction

the negotiation, execution, performance or non-performance of the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing.

 

9.14. _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Parent or the

-89- 

    

 or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to
