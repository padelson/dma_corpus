monetary relief (including any fees payable pursuant to <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;8.3</U>), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and effect the Closing. Subject to the following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that
(a)&nbsp;the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9.7(b)</U> without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;the provisions set forth in <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;8.3</U>
shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party&#146;s right to specific enforcement and (c)&nbsp;the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parent&#146;s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger Consideration and Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s obligations to effect the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i)&nbsp;all conditions in <U>Sections</U> <U>7.1</U> and <U>7.2</U> have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied at the Closing) at the Closing and at the time the Company initially institutes such proceeding Parent and Merger Sub are
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.2</U> of the Merger Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof
or will be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii)&nbsp;the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing at least three (3)&nbsp;Business Days prior thereto
(and not revoked, withdrawn or modified such confirmation) that the conditions set forth in <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;7.3</U> have been and continue to be satisfied or irrevocably waived and that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, then the Closing shall occur pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law, other than an assertion that the exercise of specific performance was not effected in accordance with provisions of this
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9.6</U>. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this
