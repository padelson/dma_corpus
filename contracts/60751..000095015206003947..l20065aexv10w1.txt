above.   Sellers and IP Sellers hereby acknowledge that they are retaining
the Retained Liabilities, and Sellers and IP Sellers shall pay, discharge
and perform all such Retained Liabilities and obligations promptly when
due.   3.3 Consents to Assignment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign any Assumed Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom, if an attempted assignment or transfer
thereof, without the Consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or
default thereof or give rise to a right of termination or cancellation
thereunder and such Consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing.
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a reasonable period of
time following the Closing Date to obtain such Consent to assignment or
transfer. If such Consent is obtained by Sellers, Sellers shall promptly
assign such Assumed Contract to Buyer and Buyer shall assume all Liabilities
relating thereto pursuant to a special-purpose assignment and assumption
agreement. If such Consent is not obtained, Sellers and Buyer will cooperate
with each other, in all commercially reasonable respects, to design an
arrangement pursuant to which Buyer will receive substantially all of the
material rights and benefits from such third party, and assume all of the
obligations relating to such Assumed Contract, including, if requested by
Buyer, acting as an agent on behalf of Buyer. Sellers shall not be required
to make any material change to their respective businesses, expend
any material funds or incur any other material burden, Liability or loss in
order to comply with its obligations set forth in this Section 3.3. Buyer is
assuming the full risk that Sellers and Buyer will be unable to establish a
commercially reasonable arrangement between Buyer and any third party whose
Consent to assign any Assumed Contract has not been obtained.   3.4 Rights
in Assumed Contract. To the extent an Assumed Contract relates to a Retained
Liability, Buyer will cooperate with Sellers, in all commercially reasonable
respects, to design an arrangement pursuant to which Sellers will receive
substantially all of the material rights and benefits from such
Assumed Contract with respect to the Retained Liability. Buyer shall not be
required to make any material change to their respective Businesses, expend
any material funds or incur any other material burden, Liability or loss in
order to comply with its obligations set forth in this Section 3.4. Sellers
are assuming the full risk that Buyer and Sellers    12    will be
unable to establish a commercially reasonable arrangement between Sellers and
any third party whose Consent to assign any Assumed Contract has not been
obtained.   ARTICLE 4  CONSIDERATION   4.1 Purchase Price. In addition to
Buyer\'s assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, the purchase price to be paid
by Buyer to Sellers\' Representative (on behalf of Sellers and IP Sellers)
shall be Two Hundred Forty-Three Million US Dollars ($243,000,000.00) (the
"Purchase Price"), plus $26,702,000.00 (the "Accounts Payable Amount") plus
or minus the Estimated Adjustment Amount, plus or minus the Final Adjustment
Amount.   4.2 Payment of Purchase Price.   (a) Payment at the Closing. At
the Closing, Buyer shall pay the  Purchase Price, plus or minus the Estimated
Adjustment Amount to Sellers\'  Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and
IP Sellers) in cash via wire  transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated two (2)  days prior to the Closing by Sellers\'
Representative in writing. If the  Estimated Adjustment Amount is negative,
the Purchase Price shall be  increased at the Closing by the absolute value
of Estimated Adjustment  Amount or if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is
positive, the Purchase  Price shall be decreased at the Closing by an amount
equal to the Estimated  Adjustment Amount.   (b) Payment at sixty (60) days
following the Closing. On the date that  is sixty 60 days following the
Closing (or the next business day if such  date is not a business day), Buyer
shall pay the Accounts Payable Amount to  Sellers\' Representative (on behalf
of the Sellers and IP Sellers). For  avoidance of doubt, the payment required
by this Section 4.2(b) shall be  the only payment made by Buyer with respect
to the Businesses\' Accounts  Payable, and there will be no further payment
by Buyer with respect to the  Businesses\' Accounts Payable in connection
with the determination of the  Closing Statement and calculation of the
Closing Working Capital.   (c) Payment of Final Adjustment Amount. Upon the
later of: (i) ninety  (90) days after the Closing Date, or (ii) thirty (30)
days after the date  of the final determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount pursuant to  Section 4.3, (A) if the Final Adjustment Amount is
negative, Buyer shall  pay Sellers\' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers
and IP Sellers) an  amount equal to the absolute value of the Final
Adjustment Amount by wire  transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified in writing  by Sellers\' Representative, or (B) if the
Final Adjustment Amount is  positive, Sellers\' Representative shall pay to
Buyer the amount equal to  the Final Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds  to an account specified in writing by Buyer, and
in either event together  with interest thereon accruing from the Closing
Date to the date of payment  of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to this
Section 4.2(c) at a rate  per annum equal to the prime rate as quoted in The
Wall Street Journal on  the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days  elapsed over 365, from the Closing Date to the date of
payment.    13    4.3 Adjustment Procedure.   (a) Definitions.   (i)
"Working Capital" as of a given time or date means the amount  determined by
subtracting the sum of: (i) (X) the Accounts Payable and  (Y) Accrued
Expenses from (ii) the sum of (X) the Accounts Receivable  (net of the amount
of any reserves relating thereto established in the  Ordinary Course of
Business); (Y) the Prepaid Expenses and (Z) the  aggregate value of the
Inventory (net of the amount of reserves  relating thereto established in the
Ordinary Course of Business), as  of such time or date as calculated in
accordance with the accounting  principles, policies and practices described
on Schedule 4.3(a), and  except as otherwise noted therein, in accordance
with GAAP,  consistently applied. For avoidance of doubt, Sellers and IP
Sellers  will retain and satisfy all Accounts Payable relating to the 
Businesses, and Accounts Payable shall be reflected as zero in the  Estimated
Working Capital, the Closing Statement, and the Closing  Working Capital.  
(ii) "Normal Working Capital" means the negotiated and agreed  amount of
$83,384,000.   (iii) "Closing Working Capital" means Working Capital at
the  Effective Time. For purposes of determining the "Closing Working 
Capital," Working Capital shall only include amounts which constitute 
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, and therefore, by way of  example,
the Accounts Payable will be zero, because Sellers and IP  Sellers are
retaining the Accounts Payable.   (iv) "Estimated Working Capital" means the
good faith joint  estimate by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers
Representative, on the  other hand, of the Working Capital of the Businesses
as of the Closing  Date, completed on or prior to the Closing Date.   (v)
"Estimated Adjustment Amount" (which may be a positive or  negative number)
means the amount determined by subtracting the  Estimated Working Capital
from the Normal Working Capital and adding  the Account Payable Amount.  
(vi) "Final Adjustment Amount" (which may be a positive or a  negative
number) means the amount determined by subtracting the  Closing Working
Capital from the Estimated Working Capital.   (b) Closing Statement. As soon
as practicable following the Closing  Date, but in no event later than one-
hundred-twenty (120) days following  the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver (or cause to be prepared  and delivered) to Sellers\'
Representative a written statement (the "Closing  Statement") setting forth
in reasonable detail Buyer\'s calculation of the  Closing Working Capital
together with supporting documentation and  information. Buyer shall prepare
(or cause to be prepared) the Closing  Statement in accordance with the
accounting principles, policies and  practices    14     described on
Schedule 4.3(a), and except as otherwise noted therein, in  accordance with
GAAP, consistently applied. Sellers and IP Sellers shall,  and shall cause
their Affiliates and Representatives to, give Buyer  reasonable access to
Sellers\' and IP Sellers\' books and records and shall  cooperate with Buyer
in connection with the preparation of the Closing  Statement and the
determination of the Closing Working Capital.   (c) Review Period. Sellers\'
Representative shall have forty-five (45)  days following receipt of the
Closing Statement to review the Closing  Statement and all supporting
documentation and information (the "Review  Period"). During the Review
Period, Buyer shall provide Sellers\'  Representative with access to the
books, records and personnel of Buyer for  the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of the Closing Statement, including  the Closing Working Capital
calculation set forth therein, and all  supporting documentation and
information.   (d) Acceptance of Adjustment Amount if not Objected to. The 
calculation of the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing 
Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and 
shall be used in calculating the Final Adjustment Amount unless Sellers\' 
Representative provides Buyer with written notice of its objection to the 
calculation of the Closing Statement or the Closing Working Capital set 
forth in the Closing Statement prior to the expiration of the Review 
Period.   (e) Dispute Resolution. If Sellers\' Representative duly
provides  written notice of their objection to the calculation of the
Closing  Statement or the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Statement  (which shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and dollar
amount of  any disagreement so asserted), and Buyer and Sellers\'
Representative are  unable to resolve Sellers\' Representative\'s objection
within fifteen (15)  days (or longer if agreed to in writing by Buyer and
Sellers\'  Representative) of Sellers\' Representative\'s duly providing
written notice  of such objection to Buyer, then Buyer and Sellers\'
Representative shall  engage the Independent Valuation Firm, to resolve any
items in dispute  between the Parties (and only such disputed items) relating
to the  calculation of the Closing Statement or the Closing Working Capital
in  accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.3. If the Independent 
Valuation Firm is engaged to resolve any items in dispute between the 
Parties relating to the calculation of the Closing Statement or the Closing 
Working Capital, (i) each Party shall furnish (or cause to be furnished) to 
the Independent Valuation Firm such documents and information reasonably 
relating to the items in dispute and the calculation of the Closing Working 
Capital as the Independent Valuation Firm may reasonably request and are 
reasonably available to that Party, and each Party shall be afforded the 
opportunity to present to the Independent Valuation Firm any other  documents
and information reasonably relating to the items in dispute and  the
calculation of the Closing Working Capital and to discuss the same with  the
Independent Valuation Firm; (ii) resolution of the items in dispute by  the
Independent Valuation Firm, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to 
Buyer and Sellers\' Representative within thirty (30) days of the 
Independent Valuation Firm engagement hereunder, shall be final, binding  and
conclusive on the Parties and shall be used in calculating the Closing 
Working Capital and the Final Adjustment Amount; (iii) the Independent 
Valuation Firm shall consider only the disputed matters that were included 
in the notice of objection and the Independent Valuation Firm may not  assign
a value to any item in dispute greater    15     than the greatest
value assigned by Sellers\' Representative, on the one  hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such  item assigned by
Sellers\' Representative, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the  other hand; and
(iv) the fees and expenses of the Independent Valuation  Firm shall be
allocated based upon the percentage which the portion of the  contested
amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually  contested by
such Party in the written presentation to the Independent  Valuation Firm
(For example, if Sellers\' Representative submits a notice of  objection for
$1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed  by Sellers\'
Representative, and if the Independent Valuation Firm  ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding Sellers\' Representative $300 of  the $500 contested,
then the costs and expenses of the Independent  Valuation Firm will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40%  (i.e., 200/500) to Sellers
and IP Sellers).   (f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.   (i) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement,  including any provision stating that
remedies shall be cumulative and  not exclusive, this Section 4.3 provides
the sole and exclusive method  for resolving any and all disputes of each and
every nature whatsoever  that may arise between or among the Parties with
respect to the  Closing Working Capital, the Closing Statement and the
Final  Adjustment Amount. As between the Parties, Sellers, IP Sellers and 
Buyer hereby irrevocably waive, relinquish and surrender on their own  behalf
and on behalf of their respective Affiliates and  Representatives all rights
to, and agree that they will not attempt,  and shall cause their Affiliates
and Representatives not to attempt,  to resolve any such Dispute or disputes
in any manner other than as  set forth in this Section 4.3, including through
litigation.   (ii) It is understood that the amount of Normal Working
Capital  is a negotiated and agreed amount which is not subject to further 
adjustment. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, to the extent that it  is
determined during the preparation of the Closing Statement and  determination
of the Closing Working Capital that a specific current  asset was omitted
from the determination of Normal Working Capital,  the amount of such current
asset which should have been included in  the Normal Working Capital will be
paid by Sellers and IP Sellers to  Buyer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account  specified in writing by Buyer (which amount
shall be determined in  accordance with the accounting principles, policies
and practices  described on Schedule 4.3(a), and except as otherwise noted
therein,  in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied). The Parties agree
that  the Normal Working Capital was calculated as set forth on Schedule 
4.3(b). For avoidance of doubt, the Inventory set forth in Schedule 
2.1(b)-4, has been intentionally excluded from Normal Working Capital;  the
Parties agree that such Inventory will be included in the  Inventory included
in the determination of the Closing Statement and  the calculation of Closing
Working Capital and will not be considered  an omission within the meaning of
this Section 4.3(f)(ii). The amount,  if any, of any payment under this
Section 4.3(f)(ii) shall be included  in the preparation of the Closing
Statement and    16     Closing Working Capital and subject to review,
objection and dispute  resolution in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4.3.   4.4 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price, the
Accounts Payables Amount, the Assumed Liabilities and other relevant items
will be allocated among the Purchased Assets and the Purchased IP Assets for
all purposes as mutually agreed to by the Parties within thirty (30) days
after the final determination of the Closing Working Capital as provided in
Section 4.3 above. Each Party agrees: (a) that any such allocation will be
consistent with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code or applicable
provision under foreign Laws; (b) to complete and to file Form 8594 with its
federal income tax return consistent with such allocation for the tax year in
which the Closing occurs or required forms under foreign Laws; and (c) that
no Party will take a position on any income, transfer, gains, or other Tax
Return, or before any Governmental Body charged with the collection of any
such Tax or in any Proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent with the
terms of any such allocation, unless required to do so by Law as interpreted
or modified subsequent to the Closing Date. For all purposes under this
Agreement, any indemnification payments made pursuant to Sections 12.2 or
13.4 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   4.5 Closing
Costs; Transfer Taxes and Fees; Prorated Costs.   (a) Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers and IP Sellers, on the other  hand, shall equally be
responsible for: (i) all documentary and transfer  Taxes and any other Taxes
imposed by reason of the transfer of the  Purchased Assets and the Purchased
IP Assets hereunder (and any deficiency,  interest or penalty asserted with
respect thereto); (ii) all recording,  filing, title and registration fees or
other charges in connection with or  as a direct result of the transfer of
the Purchased Assets or the Purchased  IP Assets; and (iii) all costs of
obtaining and maintaining owner\'s title  insurance policies on the Owned
Real Property, and the Leased Real Property  described in Schedule 2.1(e)
("Title Insurance Policies").   (b) Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers and
IP Sellers, on the other  hand, shall equally share: (i) all costs of
obtaining commitments for  owner\'s title insurance policies with respect to
the Owned Real Property  and the Leased Real Property described in Schedule
2.1(e); and (iii) the  fee charged by the Title Company in connection with
the due diligence and  the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Sellers and  IP Sellers shall pay all costs of obtaining surveys
with respect to the  Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property
described in Schedule  2.1(e)   (c) Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers and
IP Sellers, on the other  hand, shall prorate as of the Closing Date: (i)
water, electricity and gas  charges, and all other operating expenses
typically prorated between  sellers and buyers of commercial real estate, at
the Facilities through the  Closing based on readings as of the Closing or
prorated as of the Closing;  (ii) accrued but unpaid general real estate
taxes on the Owned Real  Property prorated based upon the last available tax
duplicate; provided,  however, such amounts shall be recomputed based upon
the final rates and  valuation and any amounts found due from either Party
shall be promptly  paid by the appropriate Party to    17     the
other; (iii) all special assessments and the full amount of all  installments
or any respreads of taxes and assessments on the Owned Real  Property and the
Leased Real Property described in Schedule 2.1(e); (iv)  the amount of any
recoupment of tax abatements or discounted tax valuations  (including
agricultural and forestry use valuations) resulting from the  transfer, or
current or future changes in use, of the Owned Real Property;  and (v)
accrued but unpaid general real estate tax tenant obligations under  the Real
Property Lease prorated based upon the last available tax  duplicate;
provided, however, if the Real Property Leases provide for such  adjustments,
such amounts shall be recomputed based upon the final rates  and valuation
and any amounts found due from either Party shall be promptly  paid by the
appropriate Party to the other. In no event shall Buyer be  responsible for
any Sellers\' or IP Sellers taxes, delinquent on the Closing  or for any
interest or penalties accruing in connection therewith.   ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS   Except with respect to
environmental, health and safety Permits, which are addressed under Section
5.19, none of the representations or warranties set forth in this Article 5
cover or apply to Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities, Environmental
Matters or environmental and health and safety disclosures, all of which are
exclusively covered in Article 13.   Sellers jointly and severally represent

agreements, options, commitments or rights with, of or to any Person
to purchase or otherwise acquire any of the material Purchased Assets,
Purchased IP Assets or any interests therein, except those entered into in
the Ordinary Course of Business for the sale of Inventory.   5.5 Consents.

statements of the Businesses, as adjusted,  for the period ended December 31,
2005, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated  historical balance sheets of the
Businesses, as adjusted, as of December  31, 2005 (collectively, (i) and (ii)
the "Financial Statements"). Such  historical balance sheet, as adjusted, as
of December 31, 2005 is referred  to herein as the "Most Recent Balance
Sheet."    19     (b) The Financial Statements have been consolidated
from the books and  records of the Sellers, which are kept by the Sellers in
the Ordinary  Course of Business. The Financial Statements of the Sellers
have been  prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, policies
and  practices described in Schedule 4.3(a), and except as otherwise noted 
therein, in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and are accurate  and
complete in all material respects, are consistent with the books and  records
of Sellers (which, in turn, are accurate and complete in all  material
respects), and present fairly in all material respects the  financial
condition of the Businesses as of the date thereof and the  operating results
of the Businesses for the same period covered thereby.   (c) the statements
of cash flows of the Businesses for the period from  January 1, 2005 through
December 31, 2005, if prepared and provided to  Buyer, would not show a
materially different financial condition of the  Businesses than shown by the
Financial Statements, except for the impact of  movements in toluene
inventory and payables.   5.7 Facilities.   (a) Schedule 5.7 contains a
complete and accurate list of all real  property leased or owned by any
Seller relating to the Businesses and  identifies each parcel of real
property as being owned or leased, as the  case may be. All Facilities are in
reasonable condition and repair  (ordinary wear and tear excepted) for
comparable facilities in the industry  and in sufficient condition for the
operation of the Businesses as  currently conducted and, to Sellers\'
Knowledge, except for the Permitted  Encumbrances and as set forth on
Schedule 5.7(a), there are no facts,  conditions or deficiencies affecting
any Facility which would, individually  or in the aggregate, interfere in any
material respect with the use or  occupancy of any Facility in the operation
of the Businesses.   (b) Each Seller has good and marketable fee simple
title to the Owned  Real Property insurable as such at customary rates, free
and clear of all  Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and
Encumbrances which will  be removed by Sellers or IP Sellers in connection
with or prior to the  Closing and for which Buyer will not have any Damages
relating to the  removal thereof. Each Seller, as applicable, enjoys peaceful
and  undisturbed possession of the Owned Real Property owned by such
Seller.  Except for Permitted Encumbrances and as set forth in Schedule
5.7(b),  there are no outstanding: (i) leases, subleases, licenses,
concessions or  other agreements pursuant to which Sellers have granted any
Person the  right to use or occupy any material portion of any Owned Real
Property; or  (ii) options or rights of first refusal pursuant to which
Sellers have  granted any Person the right to purchase, lease or use any
Owned Real  Property or any material portion thereof.   (c) Except as set
forth in Schedule 5.7(c), (i) the Real Property  Leases are in full force and
effect and constitute valid and binding  obligations of the applicable Seller
party thereto and, to Sellers\'  Knowledge, the other parties thereto, and
(ii) the applicable Seller is not  in default in any material respect under
any of the Real Property Leases.  Sellers have furnished or made available in
the online data room to Buyer  with true and correct copies of each Real
Property Lease, together with all  material amendments    20    
thereto. No Seller has received any written notice of cancellation or 
termination or any written notice of default under any Real Property Lease. 
Sellers\' possession and quiet enjoyment of the Leased Real Property has not 
been disturbed, and to Sellers\' Knowledge, there are no disputes with 
respect to any Real Property Lease. No security deposit or portion thereof 
deposited with respect to the Real Property Leases has been applied in 
respect of a breach or default of such Real Property Lease without being 
redeposited in full. Sellers do not owe, and will not owe in the future,  any
brokerage commissions or finder\'s fees with respect to any Real  Property
Lease. The other party to any Real Property Lease is not an  Affiliate of any
of the Sellers. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.7(c),  Sellers have not
subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any Person the  right to use
(including by way of a concession or similar agreement) or  occupy any Leased
Real Property or any portion thereof and Sellers have not  collaterally
assigned or granted any other security interest in any Real  Property Lease,
except for Permitted Encumbrances. Except as set forth on  Schedule 5.7(c),
there are no Encumbrances on the estate or interest  created by each
respective Real Property Lease, except for the Permitted  Encumbrances.  
(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.7(d), all of the Facilities are 
supplied with utilities (including water, sewage disposal, electricity, gas 
and telephone) and other services necessary for the operation of such 
Facility as currently operated.   5.8 Title to Assets; Sufficiency of
Assets.   (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.8(a), Sellers have good
and  valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of the Purchased 
Assets. The Purchased Assets are free and clear of any Encumbrances other 
than the Permitted Encumbrances, and Encumbrances which will be removed by 
Sellers or IP Sellers in connection with or prior to the Closing and for 
which Buyer will not have any Damages relating to the removal thereof.   (b)
The services and products provided pursuant to the Closing  Documents
together with the Purchased Assets, the Purchased IP Assets and  the Licensed
IP are all of the assets, property, rights, titles and  interests, whether
tangible or intangible, real or personal, that are  necessary for the conduct
of the Businesses in substantially the same  manner that they are currently
being operated.   (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.8(c), no Seller or
IP Seller has  any Subsidiary that is not a Party to this Agreement which
owns any assets,  properties, rights, titles and interests (of any kind and
nature including  by contract or otherwise) that are primarily used in the
Businesses.   5.9 Condition of Purchased Assets. Each item of machinery and
equipment and other material tangible assets (whether owned or leased)
included in the Purchased Assets is in reasonable condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) for comparable assets in the industry and
in sufficient condition for the operation of the Businesses as currently
conducted.    21     5.10 Accounts Receivable. The Accounts Receivable
(i) arose from bona fide transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business, and
(ii) represent valid and binding obligations of the account debtors. (For the
avoidance of doubt, this representation is not intended as a warranty or
guarantee of collectability of any of the Accounts Receivable.) Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.10, no Person has any Encumbrances on such Accounts
Receivables or any part thereof, and, other than agreements which set forth
(or are substantially similar to) the Businesses\' standard terms and
conditions of sale, no binding agreement for deduction, free goods, discount
or other deferred price or quantity adjustment has been made with respect to
any such Accounts Receivable.   5.11 Inventory. Subject to the aggregate
reserves for obsolete or unusable Inventory and other customary inventory
reserves reflected in the Most Recent Balance Sheet, which were determined in
accordance with the accounting principles, policies and practices described
in Schedule 4.3(a), and except as otherwise noted therein in accordance with
GAAP, consistently applied, all Inventory reflected on the Most Recent
Balance Sheet is of a quality and quantity usable and, with respect to
finished goods, saleable, in the Ordinary Course of Business.   5.12 Taxes.
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.12:   (a) Sellers have filed or caused to
be filed on a timely basis all Tax  Returns with respect to the Purchased
Assets or the operation of the  Businesses that are or were required to be
filed pursuant to applicable  Laws. All such Tax Returns and reports filed by
such Seller are true,  correct and complete in all material respects. Sellers
have paid, or made  provision for the payment of, all Taxes that have or may
have become due  for all periods covered by such Tax Returns or otherwise, or
pursuant to  any assessment received by Sellers, except such Taxes, if any,
that are  being contested in good faith. Sellers are not currently the
beneficiary of  any extension within which to file any Tax Return with
respect to the  Purchased Assets or Purchased IP Assets.   (b) All Taxes
that Sellers are or were required by Law to withhold,  deduct or collect with
respect to the employees of the Businesses have been  duly withheld, deducted
and collected and, to the extent required, have  been paid to the proper
Governmental Body or other Person.   (c) Sellers have not made any payments,
are not obligated to make any  payments, and are not a party to any agreement
that under certain  circumstances could obligate them to make any payments,
in each case with  respect to the Businesses that would not be deductible
under Code Section  280G or subject to withholding under Code Section
4999.   (d) Sellers are not a party to any Tax allocation or sharing 
agreement. Sellers do not have any liability for the Taxes of any Person 
(other than a Seller) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or  similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or  successor, by
contract, or otherwise.    22     (e) There are no material disputes
and no actual or proposed Tax  deficiencies, assessments or adjustments with
respect to the Businesses or  any assets or operations of Sellers with
respect to the Businesses.   5.13 Employee Benefits.   (a) Set forth in
Schedule 5.13(a) is a complete and correct list of  all current "employee

such Seller, or with  respect to which such Seller has or may have any
Liability; and (ii)  provides benefits, or describes policies or procedures
applicable to any  current or former director, officer, employee or service
provider of such  Seller, or the dependents of any thereof, regardless of how
(or whether)  Liabilities for the provision of benefits are accrued or assets
are  acquired or dedicated with respect to the funding thereof
(collectively,  the "Sellers\' Benefit Plans"). Each Sellers\' Benefit Plan
from which Buyer  shall assume any Liability, as set forth in Article 8 or
otherwise in this  Agreement, shall be referred to as an "Assumed Employee
Plan." Schedule  5.13(a) identifies as such any employee benefit plan that is
(w) a "Defined  Benefit Plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA); (x) a
plan intended  to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code; (y)
a  "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA); or (z) a

the Code or Sections 4001(a)(14) or 4001(b) of ERISA) ("ERISA Affiliate") 
and each Defined Benefit Plan or Multiemployer Plan which each such ERISA 
Affiliate currently maintains, contributes to or has any liability with 
respect to. Sellers have delivered to Buyer complete and correct copies of 
the plan documents, if the plan is written, and summary plan descriptions 
for those Sellers\' Benefit Plans that are subject to the reporting 
requirements of ERISA, the most recent determination letter received from 
the IRS for those Sellers\' Benefit Plans that are "qualified" under Section 
401(a) of the Code, the most recent annual report (Form 5500, with all 
applicable attachments) for those Sellers\' Benefit Plans that are subject 
to the reporting requirements of ERISA, and all related trust agreements, 
insurance contracts, and other funding arrangements that implement each 
Sellers\' Benefit Plan.   (b) No Purchased Assets or Purchased IP Assets are
subject to any  Encumbrance under Code Section 401(a)(29), ERISA Section
302(f), Code  Section 412(n), or ERISA Section 4068 or arising out of any
action filed  under ERISA. Neither Sellers, nor any ERISA Affiliate, has
directly or  indirectly acted in any manner or    23     incurred any
Liability with respect to any of the Sellers\' Benefit Plans  which has or
could give rise to any Encumbrance or claim against any of the  Purchased
Assets, or which could result in any Liability to Buyer, whether  arising out
of the establishment, operation, administration or termination  of such
Sellers\' Benefit Plans or the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.   (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13(c), Sellers have not
taken  any action which may result in Buyer being a party to, or bound by,
any of  Sellers\' Benefit Plans, and, except as set forth in Article 8, Buyer
will  have no Liability under any of Sellers\' Benefit Plans following the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (d) Sellers have
maintained workers\' compensation coverage as required  by applicable state
Law through purchase of insurance and not by  self-insurance or otherwise
except as disclosed to Buyer in Schedule  5.13(d).   (e) Except for the
continuation coverage requirements of COBRA and  except as set forth in
Schedule 5.13(e), no Seller has obligations or  potential Liability for
benefits to employees, former employees or their  respective dependents
following termination of employment or retirement  under any of the Sellers\'
Benefit Plans that are "employee welfare benefit  plans" as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Employee Welfare Benefit  Plans") and Sellers have
retained the right under any such plan set forth  on Schedule 5.13(e) to
modify or terminate such plan in the Sellers\' sole  discretion without
incurring any Liability.   (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.13(f), each
Assumed Employee  Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract or fund)
has been  maintained, funded and administered in all material respects in
accordance  with its terms and the terms of any applicable collective
bargaining  agreement and complies in form and in operation with all
applicable  requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws in all
material  respects. No Assumed Employee Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a
Defined  Benefit Plan.   (g) With respect to each Assumed Employee Plan,
all contributions  (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction  contributions) that are due have been made within the time
periods  prescribed by ERISA and the Code, and all contributions for any
period  ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have been
made or  properly accrued. All premiums or other payments for all periods
ending on  or prior to the Closing Date have been paid or properly accrued
with  respect to each Assumed Employee Plan that is an Employee Welfare
Benefit  Plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). No Assumed Benefit Plan
has any  material unfunded liability that is not taken into account in
determining  the Closing Statement and are included in the calculation of
Working  Capital.   (h) With respect to each Assumed Benefit Plan, (i)
there have been no  non-exempt "prohibited transactions" (as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or  Section 4975 of the Code), (ii) no "fiduciary" (as
defined in Section 3(21)  of ERISA) has any liability for breach of fiduciary
duty or any other  failure to act or comply in connection    24    
with the administration or investment of the assets of such Assumed Benefit 
Plan and (iii) no action, investigation, suit, proceeding, hearing or claim 
with respect to the assets thereof (other than routine claims for benefits) 
is pending or, to Sellers\' Knowledge, threatened.   (i) Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.13(i), none of the Assumed  Benefit Plans provides any
separation, severance, termination or similar  benefit or accelerate any
vesting schedule or alter any benefit structure  solely as a result of a
change in control of ownership within the meaning  of any Assumed Benefit
Plans or Section 280G of the Code.   5.14 COmpliance with Laws.   (a)
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.14, the Businesses are being  operated in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to  the
operation of the Businesses or the use of the Purchased Assets,  Purchased IP
Assets or the Licensed IP, including all such Laws in  connection with the
Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property,  except where any failure
to comply would not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in Losses to Buyer greater than  $100,000.   (b) This
Section 5.14 does not apply to Taxes, Employee Benefits and  Labor Matters:
Employees which are exclusively covered in the  representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.12, 5.13 and 5.18,  respectively.   5.15

Businesses or any of the Purchased Assets, Purchased IP Assets or Licensed IP
or that challenges, or that will have the effect of preventing, delaying or
making illegal, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to

Proceedings. Sellers and IP Sellers are not subject to or bound by any
outstanding Orders, judgments or decrees of any court or governmental entity
with respect to the Businesses, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased IP
Assets, the Licensed IP or the Assumed Liabilities.   5.16 Absence of

that could result in indemnifiable Damages under  Article 12 and Article 13
equal to or exceeding $10,000,000 promptly after  such determination.   7.8
Title Commitment and Survey.   (a) Prior to the date of this Agreement,
Sellers delivered to Buyer a  survey map and legal description of each of the
Owned Real Property and  Leased Real Property described in Schedule 2.1(e)
(each a "Survey").   (b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, Sellers caused
a title  company to examine title to the Owned Real Property and Leased
Real  Property described in    38     Schedule 2.1(e) and to present
to Buyer written commitments for owner\'s  policies of title insurance on the
Owned Real Property and Leased Real  Property described in Schedule 2.1(e),
on an American Land Title  Association form (each a "Title Commitment"),
along with copies of all  Schedule B documents.   (c) Buyer shall have a
period of ten (10) days following the date of  this Agreement to give
Sellers\' Representative notice ("Objection Notice")  of any encumbrances,
easements, conditions, restrictions, covenants,  reservations, limitations,
rights of way, encroachments or other matters  disclosed in the Title
Commitment or Survey which are not defined as  Permitted Encumbrances (except
subclause (e) of the definition of Permitted  Encumbrances set forth in
Section 16), and which are reasonably  objectionable to Buyer ("Title
Defect"). The applicable Seller has no  obligation to cure any Title Defect
(other than a Title Defect or other  title matter which is a lien for the
payment of money only that can be  removed by the payment of a definite sum
or money, all of which will be  satisfied at the Closing). If Sellers elect
not to cure or remove any other  Title Defect within thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Objection  Notice, Buyer shall have the right, at
its sole option, to: (i) waive the  Title Defect which such Seller has not
removed or cured and accept title to  the property subject to the Title
Defect; or (ii) terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section 10.1(a). If
Sellers elect to cure or remove a Title  Defect within thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Objection Notice,  Sellers may reasonably (for a
period not to exceed fifteen (15) days)  extend the Closing Date as necessary
to cure or remove such Title Defect.  Encumbrances that are (i) not objected
to by Buyer, (ii) waived by Buyer,  or (iii) cured or removed by Sellers
shall be deemed Permitted  Encumbrances.   (d) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Sellers  have the right, in connection
with the conduct of any environmental  remediation projects, to implement
deed restrictions on the Owned Real  Property and the Leased Real Property
described in Schedule 2.1(e) at any  time prior to the Closing, to the extent
such deed restrictions are  required under Environmental Laws and will not
unreasonably interfere with  Buyer\'s operations, and after the Closing,
Buyer shall be subject to such  deed restrictions pursuant to Article 13.  
7.9 Title Company. The Title Company (and not an agent of the Title Company)
shall serve as the closing agent for purposes of the transfer of the Owned
Real Property hereunder, pursuant to the terms of a closing escrow customary
for transactions of this type.   7.10 Exclusivity. Sellers and IP Sellers
shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and their respective officers,

the Purchased Assets or Purchased IP Assets (other than the disposition of
assets or Inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business) (an "Acquisition
Proposal") or provide any information to any third party other than the
provision of information as is specifically otherwise permitted hereunder or
the provision of information which is traditionally provided in the regular
course of such entity\'s business operations to third parties where such
entity and its officers, directors and Affiliates have no reason to believe
that such information may be utilized to evaluate any such Acquisition
Proposal. Sellers and IP    39    Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees and
Affiliates to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
contacts, discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) promptly notify Buyer if any Acquisition
Proposal, or any written offer or other inquiry from any third party with
respect thereto, is subsequently made.   7.11 Confidentiality. For a period
of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Sellers and IP Sellers will not,
either directly or indirectly, divulge, disclose, use, disseminate or
communicate to any Person any of Buyer\'s Confidential Information and Buyer
will not, either directly or indirectly, divulge, disclose, disseminate or
communicate to any Person any of Sellers\' or IP Sellers\' Confidential

Intellectual Property owned by Buyer after the Closing.   Immediately after
the Closing Date, except for so long as necessary to meet their delivery
obligations under this Agreement (but in no event longer than thirty (30)
days), IP Sellers and Sellers shall destroy any and all Purchased Trade
Secrets and all copies thereof in their possession; provided, Sellers and IP
Sellers may retain the Purchased Trade Secrets necessary for Sellers and
IP Sellers to perform their obligations under the Buyer Manufacturing and
Supply Agreements, in which case such Purchased Trade Secrets will be
destroyed in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Manufacturing and Supply
Agreements, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the

developed by any Party or their Affiliates after the Closing, but solely to
the extent of such independent development; or (iii) was received by any
Party without restrictions as to its use from a third party who is lawfully

to the terms of the License Agreement and Buyer License Agreement, pursuant
to a joint venture, joint development, and similar arrangement where the
Person who will receive the Confidential Information agrees (on customary and
commercially reasonable terms which protect the rights of the owner of such
Intellectual Property) not to use the Confidential Information other than in
connection with such joint venture, joint development, or similar
arrangement) when such disclosure is (a) justified by a legitimate business
purpose, in which case the disclosing party shall impose
commercially reasonable restrictions on the recipient\'s use and protection
of such Confidential Information, including, without limitation, a written,
executed confidentiality agreement requiring protection no less than the
protection required under this Agreement; (b) required by any court Order or
similar Order, or (c) required under any applicable Law, including any rule,
regulation, Order or requirement of the Securities and Exchange Commission or
any national securities exchange, provided, however, before a Party discloses
any Confidential Information under clause (b) or (c), such Party shall
promptly notify the other Party in writing, which notification shall include
the nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the required
disclosure, and shall cooperate with the other Party to preserve the
confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable Law.   7.12

such one-year period is in  violation of clause (ii) above); provided that

Person whose annual salary is  less than $60,000 and who responds to a

(c) Sellers and IP Sellers acknowledge that any breach of the  provisions of
Sections 7.12(a) or 7.12(b) by Sellers or IP Sellers may  result in
irreparable injury to Buyer (following the consummation of the  transactions
contemplated hereby), and that Buyer\'s remedies at law may be  inadequate
and insufficient. Accordingly, in the event of    42     any such
breach by Sellers or IP Sellers of Sections 7.12(a) or 7.12(b),  Buyer may be
entitled to preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, in  addition to all
such other legal and equity remedies as may be available to  Buyer therefor.

hereby irrevocably appoints Noveon ("Sellers\' Representative") as such
Sellers\' or IP Sellers\' true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent and
authorizes its acting for such Seller or IP Seller and in such Seller\'s or
IP Seller\'s name, place and stead, in any and all capacities to do and
perform every act and thing required or permitted to be done by Sellers\'
Representative in connection with this Agreement, as fully to all intents and
purposes as such Seller or IP Seller might or could do in person, including
taking any and all action on behalf of such Seller or IP Seller from time to
time as contemplated hereunder. Each Seller and IP Seller acknowledges and
agrees that upon execution of this Agreement, (i) upon any delivery by

shall be bound by such documents or action as fully as if such Seller or IP
Seller had executed and delivered such documents, and (ii) Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on any action taken by Sellers\' Representative, on behalf
of such Seller or IP Seller pursuant to this Section 7.15. Each Seller or IP
Seller will, by executing this Agreement agree that such agency, proxy
and power of attorney are coupled with an interest, and are therefore
irrevocable and shall survive the bankruptcy of    43    such Seller
or IP Seller. Sellers\' Representative will have no Liability to Buyer,
Sellers or IP Sellers with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in
its capacity as Sellers\' Representative, except with respect to
any Liability resulting primarily from Sellers\' Representative\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct.   7.16 Removal of Guarantees. Sellers and
IP Sellers hereby represent and warrant to Buyer that Schedule 7.16 sets
forth all letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or other credit
support provided by or arranged by Sellers, IP Sellers or their respective
Affiliates which benefit the Businesses and for which Buyer would be
reasonably expected to replace letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds,
or other credit support following the Closing. To Sellers\' Knowledge and to
IP Sellers\' Knowledge, other than as set forth on Schedule 7.16, Buyer will
not be required to provide or arrange for any letters of credit, guarantees,
surety bonds, or other credit support following the Closing to allow Buyer to
operate the Businesses as currently operated from and after the Closing, to
receive the benefits of any Assumed Contracts, or to continue any existing
customer, supplier, vendor or other business relation. Following the Closing,
each Seller and IP Seller agrees that it will keep in place all letters of
credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or other credit support existing on the
date hereof or on the Closing Date (whether or not set forth on Schedule
7.16) applicable to it and not take any action to terminate or modify such
letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or other credit support
until the expiration by its terms of such letters of credit, guarantees,
surety bonds, or other credit support. To the extent required by a
Governmental Body in connection with a remediation obligation relating to a
pre-Closing environmental condition, Sellers agree to issue a letter of
credit or provide such other letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or
other credit support or other financial assurance mechanism, and continue
thereafter to reissue or renew such credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or
other credit support or other financial assurance mechanism indefinitely, and
indemnify Buyer for any obligation or Damages incurred in connection
therewith. Except for that certain letter of credit marked with an asterisk
on Schedule 7.16 (for which Buyer shall have no Liability), Buyer hereby
agrees to indemnify the applicable Seller or IP Seller for any Liability to
the beneficiary of such letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or other
credit support pursuant to the terms of such credit support and which relates
to a default by Buyer of the underlying obligations pursuant to which such
credit support was put in place and which first arises following the Closing.
With respect to letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, or other credit
support set forth on Schedule 7.16, Buyer further agrees to pay to the
applicable Seller or IP Seller an amount which shall be negotiated in good
faith between the parties following the date hereof equal to the fee which
Buyer would pay to its financial institution to provide similar
credit support.   7.17 License Agreement.   (a) At the Closing, Seller
and IP Sellers will grant to Buyer or its  Affiliates a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, transferable (in whole  or in part, including in
connection with the purchase of all or  substantially all of the assets to
which this license relates),  sublicensable, fully pledgable, fully-paid,
royalty-free, worldwide license  (with the right to sublicense) to use, make,
have made, improve upon, sell  or distribute (each, in any manner) any

license permits sublicensing) by  any Seller or any IP Seller (or their
respective Affiliates) and not  otherwise transferred under Section 2.2 and
used in the Businesses prior to  the    44     Closing Date (the
"Licensed IP"); provided, Buyer and its Affiliates may  not use the Licensed
IP to produce products, or the functional equivalents  of products, that
primarily relate to Sellers\' or IP Sellers\'  non-transferred businesses as
of the Closing (provided such products are  capable of contemporaneous
documentation), unless the Businesses were also  selling such products or the
functional equivalents of such products as of  the Closing (provided the
Businesses\' involvement in such products is  capable of contemporaneous
documentation). The foregoing license shall be  sole and exclusive, including
to the exclusion of Sellers and IP Sellers  and their respective Affiliates
except with respect to the Antioxidants  Field and the Compete Field, within
the fields of the Businesses for a  period of five (5) years from the Closing
Date, and Buyer shall have the  right to enforce the Licensed IP in those
fields, provided: (i) Buyer  notifies Seller and IP Seller promptly after
instituting any lawsuit; and  (ii) any settlement of any such legal dispute
does not detrimentally affect  Sellers\' and IP Sellers\' rights in the
Licensed IP. Seller shall also  provide Buyer copies of all records and
documentation related to the  Licensed IP and necessary for Buyer to avail
itself of the benefits of such  Licensed IP. The license arrangement
contemplated by this Section 7.17(a)  shall include the foregoing terms and
shall be referred to herein as the  "License Agreement".   (b) At the
Closing, Buyer will grant Lubrizol or its Affiliates a  non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, transferable (in whole or in part,  including in
connection with the purchase of all or substantially all of  the assets to
which this license relates), royalty-free, worldwide license  (without the
right to sublicense) solely in the Antioxidant Field and the  Compete Field
to use, make, have made, improve upon, sell and distribute  the Buyer
Licensed IP owned by Buyer (the "Buyer License Agreement"). The  term "Buyer
Licensed IP" shall mean: (y) the patents identified on Schedule  7.17(b); and
(z) the trade secrets and know-how actually used or being  developed by
Seller in the Antioxidant Field prior to the Closing Date, to  the extent
such actual use and development can be established by  contemporaneous
documentation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  this Agreement,
the Buyer License Agreement shall: (i) be subject to  Section 7.12 of this
Agreement; and (ii) impose no obligation on Buyer to  license Seller any
Intellectual Property to which a third party may have  rights, whether by
contract, license or otherwise; and (iii) except as  specifically scheduled
in Schedule 7.17(b), impose no obligation on Buyer  to license Seller any
Intellectual Property used exclusively in the  Businesses. Furthermore,
Sellers, IP Sellers and their Affiliates hereby  waive, and covenant not to
enforce, during the Restricted Period, any  rights Seller or its Affiliates
may have against Buyer, its Affiliates,  R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc. and
its Affiliates ("RT Vanderbilt"), BP  Exploration and Oil, Inc. and its
Affiliates ("Air/BP") under the law,  including under contract or tort, that
would limit or impair Buyer\'s  ability to sell, supply or trade with each of
RT Vanderbilt or Air/BP under  contracts existing as of the Closing Date, as
may be amended or restated,  or as entered into following the Closing Date,
during the Restricted  Period, on terms substantially similar to those in the
RT Vanderbilt or  Air/BP contracts existing as of the Closing Date.   7.18
Use of Lubrizol or Noveon Name.   (a) Buyer shall (and shall cause Buyer\'s
Affiliates to), to the extent  commercially reasonable, remove or render
illegible all references to  "Lubrizol" or    45     "Noveon" or any
variation thereof, including "LZ," "NV," "Lubrizol  Performance Products,"
and "Lubrizol Foam Control Products", appearing on  the Inventories purchased
and acquired hereunder unless such removal or  rendering illegible would
cause such Inventories to become unusable. Aside  from any failure to use
commercially reasonable efforts as required  pursuant to this Section
7.18(a), no failure to actually remove or render  illegible such references
shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement.   (b) If removing or rendering
illegible all references to "Lubrizol" or  "Noveon" or any variation thereof,
including "LZ," "NV," "Lubrizol  Performance Products," "Lubrizol Foam
Control Products" and the like,  appearing on the Inventory purchased and
acquired hereunder would cause  such Inventory to become unusable, Buyer (or
Buyer\'s Affiliates) shall be  entitled use such Inventory in the ordinary
course of Buyer\'s (or Buyer\'s  Affiliates\') business for a period of
twelve (12) consecutive months  following the Closing Date without modifying
such references; provided,  however, that, within six (6) months of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (or  shall cause Buyer\'s Affiliates to) affix in a
prominent manner and location  on any finished goods in Inventories to be
sold or distributed to third  parties markings that are sufficient to
identify Buyer (or Buyer\'s  Affiliates) as the manufacturer or seller of
such items.   (c) Buyer shall (and shall cause Buyer\'s Affiliates to)
refrain from  using the name "Lubrizol" or "Noveon" or any variation thereof,

provision of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents) shall limit or 
prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from, and Sellers, IP Sellers, and their 
Affiliates shall not seek to limit or prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from:

the relations to Sellers or IP Sellers; or (ii) using any term in a  generic
or descriptive manner, or using any terms such as "Specialty,"

their Affiliates and their successors and assigns, agree and acknowledge that
the Offsite Equipment may only be used to supply products and services to
Buyer and its successors or assigns pursuant to the Buyer Manufacturing and
Supply Agreements. Sellers and IP Sellers, on behalf of themselves and their
Affiliates and their successors and assigns, agree to keep the Offsite
Equipment in reasonable condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) for comparable equipment in the industry. All such Offsite
Equipment will be sold "AS IS", "WHERE IS".   7.24 Shared Agreements. The
Parties agree and acknowledge that there are certain Contracts which relate
to both the Businesses, on the one hand, and the businesses (other than the
Businesses) of Sellers, IP Sellers and their respective Affiliates on the
other hand (such contracts, the "Shared Contracts") and that following the
Closing certain Shared Contracts will be assigned by Sellers to Buyer and
certain Shared Contracts will not be assigned to Buyer. The Parties agree (on
behalf of themselves and their Affiliates) that at the written request of the
other Parties they will, and they will cause their Affiliates to, cooperate
with each other, in all commercially reasonable respects, to design
an arrangement pursuant to which Buyer and its Affiliates, in the case of
Shared Contracts that will not be assigned to Buyer, and Sellers and IP
Sellers and their respective Affiliates, in the case of Shared Contracts that
will be assigned to Buyer, may receive substantially all of the material
rights and benefits (and assume, discharge and indemnify for its
proportionate share of the obligations) of such Shared Contracts as may be
received today. Each of the Parties agrees and acknowledges that it may not
be possible to design such an arrangement, and if it is not possible to
design such an arrangement, except for the failure to use commercially
reasonable efforts required hereby, no Person shall be liable to any other
Person pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.24.   7.25 BUTADIENE, ANILINE
AND DPA SUPPLY. From and following the Closing until December 31, 2009, the
Parties agree to cooperate with each other, in all commercially reasonable
respects, to design shared purchasing and other arrangements that ensures

and their Affiliates, on the other hand, with the supply of butadiene,
aniline and DPA from Chemtura Corporation, Equistar Chemicals, LP or other
suppliers of butadiene, aniline and DPA as is necessary to satisfy their
operating needs from time to time. The Parties agree to work with each other
pursuant to this Section 7.25 to maximize their combined purchasing power and
seek to obtain supplies upon the best possible available pricing, volume, and
other terms. The Parties further agree to work together pursuant to
this Section 7.25 even if one of the Parties no longer benefits from this
Section 7.25 because it no longer requires butadiene, aniline and DPA in its
operations or for some other reason. If requested by the other Party, each
Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase
butadiene, aniline and DPA directly (on behalf of the other Party) from
suppliers and sell such materials to the other Party; provided that the
requesting Party shall pay all of the purchasing Party\'s out-of-pocket costs
and expenses related thereto. The Parties agree that whenever they work
together pursuant to an arrangement created hereunder they shall pay the same
price for the materials purchased hereunder. The Parties agree and
acknowledge that such arrangement could include designing an arrangement
pursuant to which Buyer and its Affiliates, in the case of Sellers, IP
Sellers, or their Affiliates supply contracts, and Sellers and IP Sellers and
their respective Affiliates, in the case of Buyer\'s and its Affiliates\'
supply contracts,    48    may receive substantially all of the
material rights and benefits (and assume, discharge and indemnify for its
proportionate share of the obligations) may be received today and pursuant to
arrangements. The Parties agree an arrangement could include the other Party
enjoying all of the benefits of the other Party\'s relationship.   7.26
Assumed Contracts. Within fourteen (14) days after the date hereof, Sellers
and IP Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with
a list of all Contracts located in the online data room that they believe are
Assumed Contracts, and to the extent Buyer does not already have a copy
of any Contract on such list, a copy of such Contract. For avoidance of
doubt, Article 2 shall govern whether or not such Contract is actually an
Assumed Contract, and no argument will ever be made that the failure to list
a Contract results in any obligation of Sellers or IP Sellers or any failure
of Sellers or IP Sellers to be obligated.   7.27 Documents in the Online
Data Room. Within two (2) business days of the date hereof, Sellers and IP
Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a CD-Rom which contains all the documents in

other agreement to the contrary (including the Confidentiality Agreement)

reasonable request, Sellers and IP Sellers will arrange meetings with such
customers of, and suppliers and vendors to, and other business relations.  
7.29 Shared Equipment. The Parties agree and acknowledge that there
is certain equipment which relates to both the Businesses, on the one hand,
and the businesses (other than the Businesses) of Sellers, IP Sellers and
their respective Affiliates on the other hand (such contracts, the "Shared
Equipment") and that following the Closing certain equipment will be conveyed
by Sellers to Buyer and certain equipment will not be conveyed to Buyer. The
Parties agree (on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates) that at the
written request of the other Parties they will, and they will cause their
Affiliates to, cooperate with each other, in all commercially reasonable
respects, to design an arrangement (which shall not unreasonably interfere

be conveyed to Buyer, and Sellers and IP Sellers and their respective
Affiliates, in the case of Shared Equipment that will be conveyed to Buyer,
may continue to use and benefit (but shall assume, discharge and indemnify
for its proportionate share of any costs and expense related thereto) of such
Shared Equipment as is enjoyed today. Each of the Parties agrees and
acknowledges that it may not be possible to design such an arrangement, and
if it is not possible to design such an arrangement, except for the failure
to use commercially reasonable efforts required hereby, no Person shall be
liable to any other Person pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.29.   
49     ARTICLE 8  EMPLOYEE MATTERS   8.1 Employment. Prior to the
Closing Date, and at a time chosen in consultation with Sellers, Buyer shall

benefits, defined pension  plan benefits, and nonqualified retirement
benefits) that, in the  aggregate, are competitive in the industry for
companies of similar size  and nature and in a similar location as of the
Closing Date; provided,  however, any compensation and benefits provided to
any Transferred Employee  subject to any collective bargaining agreement
shall comply with all  applicable requirements of such collective bargaining
agreement. Nothing  herein shall serve to change the at-will employment
relationship of any  non-union employee not possessing an employment
agreement with any of the  Businesses.   (b) The Transition Services

recognized for comparable purposes under the corresponding Sellers\' Benefit 
Plan.    50     (c) To the extent reflected in the Closing Working
Capital, Buyer  shall assume and discharge all obligations of each Seller to
its  Transferred Employees, whether or not yet payable in respect of
periods  prior to the Closing Date for payroll, vacation and sick time;
provided  that Buyer\'s liability for the obligations assumed in this Section
8.1(c)  with respect to the Businesses, other than the vacation obligation

and shall pay any bonus payments under such bonus plans  in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such bonus plans; provided  that any such bonus

Closing Date or as soon as  administratively practicable following the
Closing Date.   (d) Buyer shall reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates,
parents and  Subsidiaries, with respect to any Liabilities paid by Sellers
under the  Sellers\' Severance Practice arising solely out of any failure by

commence on  the Closing Date (or with respect to any disabled employee or
employee on a  leave of absence, the date such employee is eligible to return
to work with  Buyer following the Closing Date) in accordance with Section
8.1. A copy of  Sellers\' Severance Practice is attached as Schedule
8.1(d).   (e) Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the transfer of the
Purchased  Assets to Buyer contemplated by this Agreement constitutes the
sale of one  or more businesses within the meaning of WARN. Notwithstanding
anything  contained in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that
for  purposes of WARN, it will be responsible for all applicable notices
and  Liabilities under WARN resulting from any termination of employment
which  occurs on or after the Closing Date, provided, however, that Sellers
shall  provide to Buyer on or before the Closing Date a list of all
employee  layoffs, by date and location, implemented by the Businesses in the
90-day  period immediately preceding the Closing. Sellers shall indemnify
Buyer  against all liabilities and obligations arising under WARN prior to
the  Closing.   (f) Buyer shall assume and pay as and when due all
Liabilities or  amounts due to, or in respect of, any Transferred Employee

Sellers shall remain responsible and indemnify Buyer for the  maintenance,
administration, funding and payment or distribution of any and  all benefits
accruing or arising under or with respect to the Sellers\'  Benefit Plans,
including the Sellers\' Pension Plans. Except as otherwise  provided in the
Transition Services Agreement, on and after the Closing  Date Buyer shall be
responsible and indemnify Seller for the  administration, funding and payment
or distribution of any and all benefits  accruing or arising under or with
respect to such employee benefit plans or  programs as the Buyer may
establish or maintain on or after the Closing  Date for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees.   (b) Vesting. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall
take, or shall cause  to be taken, all steps necessary to fully vest all
Transferred Employees in  their benefits or account balances under each
Sellers\' Benefit Plan that is  intended to be "qualified" under Section
401(a) of the Code.   (c) Defined Benefit Pension Plans. As of the Closing
Date, Seller  shall amend each Sellers\' Pension Plan to provide that each
Transferred  Employee who is at least age 50 as of December 31, 2006 but less
than age  55 as of the Closing Date and who has an accrued benefit under any
such  Sellers\' Pension Plan as of the Closing Date shall have their
employment  with Buyer and its Affiliates (including any successors thereto)
credited  for purposes of determining such Transferred Employee\'s
eligibility for any  early retirement pension or subsidy under the Sellers\'
Pension Plan, but  only if such Transferred Employee applies for early
retirement under such  Sellers\' Pension Plan on or after retirement or
termination of employment  from the employment of the Buyer and its
Affiliates, (including any  successors thereto). For avoidance of doubt, no
such credit for a  Transferred Employee\'s service with Buyer shall result in
the continued  accrual of any normal retirement benefit under any Sellers\'
Pension Plan.   (d) Retiree Medical and Life Plans Under Collective
Bargaining  Agreements. With respect to each Transferred Employee who works
pursuant to  a collective bargaining agreement set forth in Section 8.3
herein and is  listed on Schedule 8.2(d), Buyer shall assume or retain all

Medical and Life Insurance  Benefits. Following the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide retiree medical  and life insurance benefits under any
Sellers\' Benefit Plan to each  Transferred Employee (other than such
Transferred Employees set forth in  the preceding paragraph) and any other
current or former employees of the  Business (including any beneficiaries
thereto) who would have satisfied the  eligibility requirements (as such
requirements existed as of the Closing  Date) for such benefits as if such
Transferred Employee\'s service with  Buyer or any of its Affiliates during
the period beginning on the Closing  Date and ending on December 31, 2006 is
deemed service with Seller.   (f) Plan to Plan Transfer of 401(k) Benefits.
Sellers and Buyer agree  to transfer the account balances of the Transferred
Employees in Sellers\'  401(k) Plans to Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan. The Parties
agree that such transfer  shall occur as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date and each Seller  shall cause the trustee of each Seller\'s
401(k) Plan to transfer in cash  (and notes evidencing participant loans) to
the qualified trust established  under Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan the account
balances whether or not vested of all  Transferred Employees in Sellers\'
401(k) Plans. With respect to notes  evidencing plan loans, Sellers\' 401(k)
Plans shall assign such notes to  Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan. Until the transfer to
the Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan occurs,  the applicable Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate to take such steps as may  be necessary to permit Transferred
Employees with outstanding loans from  the applicable Seller\'s 401(k) Plan
to make timely payments to service such  loans and avoid default thereunder.
Sellers shall make all contributions  required under any Sellers\' 401(k)
Plan for the Transferred Employees who  are participants in such plans for

establishment of Buyer\'s Medical Plan, but in no  event later than December
31, 2006, Buyer shall allow all such Transferred  Employees and their
eligible dependents to enroll, without any waiting  period, in Buyer\'s
Medical Plan. For such individuals who elect to enroll  in Buyer\'s Medical
Plan, Buyer and Buyer\'s Medical Plan shall be  responsible for all the
medical, dental and prescription drug expenses  incurred by such individuals
and their eligible dependents on and after the  date of enrollment. In
accordance with the Transition Services Agreement,  Buyer shall be
responsible for all the medical, dental and prescription  drug expenses
actually incurred by Sellers with respect to Transferred  Employees and their
dependents under the Sellers\' Healthcare Plans after  the Closing Date and
prior to enrollment in the Buyer\'s Medical Plan  including such other costs
as set forth in Section 8.1(b)(iii) of this  Agreement. With respect to such
individuals, Buyer shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to waive any
restrictions and limitations for  pre-existing conditions except to the
extent such individuals were subject  to such restrictions and limitations
under Sellers\' Healthcare Plans as of  the day prior to the date of
enrollment in Buyer\'s Medical Plan. Sellers  and Buyer hereby agree that any
Transferred Employee who (i) as of the  Closing Date is entitled to receive
short-term disability benefits and who  subsequently becomes eligible   
53     to receive long-term disability benefits or (ii) as of the Closing
Date is  receiving or entitled to receive long-term disability benefits,
shall  become eligible or continue to be eligible, as applicable to receive 
long-term disability benefits under such Sellers\' Benefit Plan unless and

Except to the extent otherwise provided  in the Transition Services
Agreement, Sellers and Sellers\' Healthcare Plans  shall only be responsible
for medical, dental and prescription drug  expenses of the Transferred
Employees and their dependants to the extent  such expenses are covered under
the terms of Sellers\' Healthcare Plans and  are incurred prior to the
Closing Date. For purposes of this subsection  (h), an expense is incurred
when the medical, dental, prescription drug or  other health benefit service
is rendered or performed regardless of when  such claim for such expense is
submitted for reimbursement. The Buyer\'s  Medical Plan shall take into
account expenses incurred by a Transferred  Employee under Sellers\'
Healthcare Plans on or after the first day of the  plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs, and up to the date that the  Transferred Employee
enrolls in Buyer\'s Medical Plan, for purposes of  determining deductibles
and out-of-pocket limits under Buyer\'s Medical Plan  for Transferred
Employees in the plan years in which such enrollment  occurs.   8.3 Union
Contracts. Effective as of and conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Closing, Buyer shall (a) recognize the current collective

representation or warranty made  by Sellers or IP Sellers in this Agreement,
or except for the Closing  Documents, in any of the signed certificates or
other signed instruments or  signed agreements furnished to Buyer by Sellers
or IP Sellers pursuant to  this Agreement after the date hereof and on
or    63     prior to the Closing Date, other than the representations

Permits were not transferable to Sellers, either of which are necessary to 
allow Buyer to own and operate the Businesses and the Purchased Assets and 
the Purchased IP Assets as currently operated from and after the Closing 
exceeds $160,000 (excluding costs and expenses paid by Buyer to its 
Representatives), then such out-of-pocket costs and expenses (excluding

Person") from and against any and all Damages any Sellers\' Indemnified
Person may suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of or in
connection with:   (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made  by Buyer in this Agreement, or, except for the Closing
Documents, in any of  the signed certificates or other signed instruments or
signed agreements  furnished to Seller or IP Sellers by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement after  the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing
Date;   (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this

Transferred Employees by  the Buyer; and   (e) Product Liability claims
made against Sellers following the  Closing Date; provided that Buyer\'s
liability per claim under this Section  12.3(e) shall in no event exceed
$100,000 per claim, with it being  understood that all Liabilities directly
relating to claims arising out of  the same set of operative facts shall be
considered a single claim for  purposes of this Agreement and shall be
aggregated for purposes of  determining Buyer\'s maximum exposure to
$100,000.   12.4 Limitation of Indemnification.   (a) Buyer Indemnified
Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification  hereunder with respect to
any Damages specified in Section 12.2(a) and  Section 12.2(d), unless the
particular indemnifiable damage or loss exceeds  $50,000 (each an "Allowable
Damage" and collectively, the "Allowable  Damages"), with it being understood
that all Damages relating to claims  arising out of the same set of operative
facts shall be considered an  individual claim for purposes of this Agreement
and such items shall be  aggregated for purposes of this proviso.   (b)
Noveon and Lubrizol shall not have any obligation to indemnify any  Buyer
Indemnified Persons for Allowable Damages specified in Section  12.2(a)
(other than with respect to representations and warranties  contained in the
Fundamental Representations) unless and until such Buyer  Indemnified Persons
have incurred Allowable Damages in an aggregate amount  in excess of
$1,500,000, in which event such Buyer Indemnified Persons  shall be entitled
to be indemnified for the entire amount of such aggregate  Allowable Damages.
The Parties agree and acknowledge that for purposes of  satisfying the
$1,500,000 threshold set forth in this Section 12.4(b) that  indemnification
obligations for Environmental Costs incurred under Article  13 shall not
apply toward the satisfaction of such threshold.   (c) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  Noveon\'s and Lubrizol\'s
aggregate indemnity obligation for Allowable  Damages specified in Section
12.2(a) (when aggregated with its  indemnification obligations for
Environmental Costs incurred under Section  13.4(a)) shall in no event exceed
ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price.  Other than with regard to the
Fundamental Representations, no recovery for  indemnification of Allowable
Damages under Section 12.2(a) shall be  received by any Buyer Indemnified
Person to the extent the aggregate  Allowable Damages received under Section
12.2(a) (including any Allowable  Damages and Allowable Environmental Cost
previously recovered under Section  12.2(a) and Section 13.4(a)) by all of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons, taken  as a whole, exceed ten percent (10%) of
the Purchase Price; and, other than  with regard to the Fundamental
Representations, Sellers and IP Sellers  shall have no responsibility for
Allowable Damages under Section 12.2(a) to  Buyer Indemnified Persons
thereafter.    65     (d) Nothing in this Agreement (including this
Section 12.2) shall  limit or restrict any of Buyer\'s rights to maintain or
recover any amounts  in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud.
No Buyer  Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder
with  respect to Damages to the extent (but only to the extent) the matter
giving  rise to such Damages resulted in an adjustment (in favor of Buyer) to
the  Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.3 or to the extent (but only up
to  such amount) the underlying matters are accrued for and identified with 
specificity on the Closing Statement.   (e) Buyer acknowledges that the
indemnifications provided by Sellers  and IP Sellers under Section 12.2 are
being made by Noveon and Lubrizol on  behalf of all Sellers and IP Sellers,
and Noveon and Lubrizol are the only  Parties available to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for claims of  indemnification against the Sellers and IP
Sellers.   12.5 Third-Party Claims.   (a) The provisions of this Section
12.5 shall apply to any legal  Proceeding which is instituted or any claim
asserted by any third party (a  "Third Party Claim") in respect of which a
Sellers Indemnified Party, on  the one hand, or a Buyer Indemnified Party, on
the other hand, may be  entitled to indemnification under this Article 12,
the Party asserting such  right to indemnification under this Article 12 (an
"Indemnitee") shall give  the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party")  prompt written notice thereof. A delay in giving such
notice shall relieve  the Indemnifying Party of Liability for the Third Party
Claim to the extent  (and only to such extent) the Indemnifying Party suffers
Damages for which  the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be greater than
such Damages would  have been had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt
notice hereunder.  The written notice shall set forth (to the extent known)
in reasonable  detail the alleged factual basis for such Third Party Claim,
the provision  or provisions of this Agreement on which such claim is based,
and the  Indemnitee\'s good-faith estimate of the amount of the claim.  
(b) If an Indemnitee gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant  to
Section 12.5(a) of the assertion of a Third Party Claim, the  Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such  Third Party
Claim and, at its option, to assume the defense and control of  such Third
Party Claim. Such assumption of control shall constitute the  Indemnifying
Party\'s acknowledgment that the Indemnifying Party will be  responsible for
any and all Liability or Damages associated with the  tendered claim.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,  in no event,
without the written consent of the Indemnitee, shall an  Indemnifying Party
be able to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim,  if: (i) the
Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third  Party Claim is
made and the Indemnitee determines in good faith that joint  representation
would be inappropriate; (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an  injunction that
materially interferes with the business or other operations  of the
Indemnitee; (iii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises  in
connection with any criminal Proceeding, action, indictment, allegation  or
investigation; (iv) the Indemnitee reasonably believes an adverse 
determination with respect to the action, lawsuit, investigation,  Proceeding
or    66     other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification
would be  detrimental to or injure the Indemnitee\'s reputation or future
business  prospects; (v) upon petition by the Indemnitee, the appropriate
court rules  that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or  defend such claim; or (vi) the Indemnitee reasonably believes
that the loss  relating to such claim for indemnification could exceed the
maximum amount  that the Indemnitee could then be entitled to recover under
Section 12.4.  After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee of
its election  to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee
shall have  the right, but not the obligation, to participate in such
Proceedings with  counsel of its own choice, but the Indemnifying Party shall
not, so long as  it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Indemnitee under this  Section 12.5 for any fees of Indemnitee\'s counsel or
any other expenses  with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim,
incurred by the  Indemnitee after the assumption of the defense by the
Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim the  Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnitee\'s
written consent,  settle or compromise such Third Party Claim, or consent to
the entry of any  judgment, unless each of the following requirements is
satisfied: (A) there  is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or
any violation of the  rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that  are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (C)
the Indemnitee is  expressly and unconditionally released from all Liability
from the Third  Party Claim and the events giving rise to the Third Party
Claim. The  Indemnitee shall have no Liability with respect to any compromise
or  settlement of such Third Party Claims affected without its written
consent.   (c) With respect to any Third Party Claim subject to
indemnification  under this Article 12: (i) both the Indemnitee and the
Indemnifying Party,  as the case may be, shall keep the other Person
reasonably informed of the  status of such Third Party Claim and any related
Proceedings at all stages  thereof where such Person is not represented by
its own counsel; and (ii)  the Parties agree (each at its own expense) to
render to each other such  assistance as they may reasonably require of each
other and to cooperate in  good faith with each other in order to ensure the
proper and adequate  defense of any Third Party Claim.   (d) With respect
to any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification  under this Article 12,
the Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as  to preserve in full (to
the extent possible) the confidentiality of all  Confidential Information and
the attorney-client and work-product  privileges. In connection therewith,
each Party agrees that: (i) it will  use commercially reasonable efforts, in
respect of any Third Party Claim in  which it has assumed or participated in
the defense, to avoid production of  Confidential Information (consistent
with applicable Law and rules of  procedure); and (ii) all communications
between any Party hereto and  counsel responsible for or participating in the
defense of any Third Party  Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so
as to preserve any  applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.  
12.6 Other Claims. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of Damages which do
not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted
by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof,
stating the nature of such claim in reasonable    67    detail and
indicating the estimated amount, if practicable, and the Indemnifying Party
shall have a period of thirty (30) days within which to respond to
such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within such
thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
accepted such claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, the
Parties covenant and agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
their dispute with respect to such claim within thirty (30) days of receipt
of such written notice. If despite such commercially reasonable efforts, the
Parties are unable to resolve their dispute, such dispute shall be promptly
submitted to Arbitration pursuant to Article 14.   12.7 Exclusive Remedy of
Parties. The remedies provided in this Article 12 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties for any breach by any or all of Sellers or IP
Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other, of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than indemnification for
Environmental Matters as set forth in Article 13 and remedies set forth
in the Closing Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, other than claims based on fraud, except for Damages
incurred by Buyer Indemnified Persons or Sellers Indemnified Persons as a
direct result of the matters described in Section 12.2 or 12.3, respectively,
Sellers, IP Sellers and its and their Affiliates shall have no Liability to
any Buyer Indemnified Person, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no
Liability to any Seller Indemnified Person, including any Liability incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased IP
Assets or the operation of the Businesses other than for Liabilities for
Environmental Matters as set forth in Article 13 and Liabilities pursuant to
the Closing Documents.   12.8 Amount of Claims; Insurance; Tax Benefits.  
(a) Insurance. To the extent that any indemnification claim made under  this
Article 12 is covered by insurance held by a Buyer Indemnified Person  (an
"Insured Loss"), the Buyer Indemnified Person shall only be entitled to 
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2 hereof with respect to the amount 
of indemnification claim in excess of the net insurance proceeds actually 
received (after deduction for any cost of collection, deductible, 
retroactive premium adjustment, reimbursement obligation or other cost 
directly related to such insurance claim) by the Buyer Indemnified Person 
pursuant to such insurance. With respect to any Insured Loss, the Buyer 
Indemnified Person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain 
recovery from the provider of such insurance; provided that a Buyer 
Indemnified Person shall have no obligation to seek recovery under any 
insurance policy to the extent that any claims against such insurance  policy
for such Damages would result in an increase in the premium for such 
insurance policy or in cancellation of such policy. Notwithstanding  anything
herein to the contrary, a Buyer Indemnified Person may pursue  recovery
hereunder prior to the resolution of any such insurance claim, and  Noveon,
and if Noveon fails to do so then, Lubrizol, shall pay to the  applicable
Buyer Indemnified Party such amounts as it would otherwise be  obligated to
pay to such Buyer Indemnified Person without respect to this  Section 12.8(a)
and prior to such time as such Buyer Indemnified Person has  determined
whether such Damages is covered (or not covered) by insurance  held by such
Buyer Indemnified Party. If, following the receipt of any  indemnity payments
pursuant to Section 12.2, a Buyer Indemnified Person  obtains any insurance
recovery from a third party insurance provider, then  the Buyer Indemnified
Person shall promptly pay over to Noveon the net  amount of    68    
the proceeds received by such Buyer Indemnified Person (after deduction for 
any cost of collection, deductible, retroactive premium adjustment, 
reimbursement obligation or other cost directly related to such insurance 
claim) pursuant to such insurance up to, but not in excess of, the amount  of
the indemnification claim paid by Noveon or Lubrizol. The Parties agree  that
no insurance company shall have any right of subrogation under this  Section
12.8(a) and the Parties agree that this Section 12.8(a) is not for  the
benefit of any third party insurance provider.   (b) Tax Benefit. To the
extent that an Indemnitee recognizes Tax  Benefits as a result of any Buyer
Indemnified Party\'s Damages or Sellers\'  Indemnified Party\'s Damages, as
applicable, the Indemnitee shall pay an  amount equal to the amount of such
Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the  indemnification payment or payments
actually received from the Indemnifying  Party with respect to such Buyer
Indemnified Party\'s Damages or Sellers\'  Indemnified Party\'s Damages) to
the Indemnifying Party when such Tax  Benefits are actually recognized by the
Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall  pay the amount of such Tax Benefits to the
Indemnifying Party within ten  (10) days of filing any Tax Return reflecting
a Tax Benefit. For this  purpose, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize
a tax benefit ("Tax  Benefit") with respect to a taxable year if, and to the
extent that, the  Indemnitee\'s cumulative liability for Taxes through the
end of such taxable  year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable
to the Buyer  Indemnified Party\'s Damages or Sellers\' Indemnified Party\'s
Damages, as  applicable, and the receipt of any indemnification payments from
all  taxable years, exceeds the Indemnitee\'s actual cumulative liability
for  Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into 
account any Tax items attributable to the Buyer Indemnified Party\'s Damages 
or Sellers\' Indemnified Party\'s Damages, as applicable, and the receipt of 
any indemnification payments for all taxable years (to the extent permitted 
by relevant Tax Law and not already taken into account for a previous 
taxable year pursuant to this Section 12.8(b) and treating such Tax items  as
the last items claimed for any taxable year).   12.9 Adjustment to Purchase
Price for Tax Purposes. It is the intent of the Parties that any amounts paid
under this Article 12 will represent an adjustment of the Purchase Price, and
the Parties will report such payments consistent with such intent.  
ARTICLE 13  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS   13.1 Exclusivity of Article. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement (including, with respect to the Retained
Liabilities, Liabilities relating to Anhydrous Ammonia Release Liability,
Former Facilities, Pre-Closing Toxic Tort Liabilities, and the provisions in
Section 5.19 regarding environmental, health and safety Permits), this
Article 13 exclusively governs the Parties\' and their Affiliates\'
Liabilities relating to Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities,
Environmental Matters, environmental and health and safety disclosures and
the allocation of Environmental Costs between the Parties and their
Affiliates as such costs relate to the Owned Real Property, the Leased Real
Property and the ownership and operation of the Businesses. Except as to the
Retained Liabilities including Liabilities relating to Former Facilities
and Pre-Closing Toxic Tort Liabilities or as set forth in this Article 13,
Buyer and    69    Sellers and IP Sellers, for themselves and their
Affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns, each release and
discharge each other from any and all rights, claims or causes of action that
any of them may now have under any and all Occupational Safety and Health
Laws and Environmental Laws (including the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
Sections 9601, et seq., "CERCLA") relating to the Owned Real Property, the
Leased Real Property, the ownership of the Purchased Assets and the operation
of the Businesses. For avoidance of doubt, Sellers and IP Sellers agree and
acknowledge that nothing in this Article 13 or elsewhere in this Agreement
(other than the limitation set forth in Section 13.5) shall limit Buyer\'s
right to recover for breaches of the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 5.19.   13.2 Sellers\' Environmental Representation and Warranty.
Sellers jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer that as of the
date hereof, and with respect to Sections 13.2(a) through 13.2(g) below,
except as disclosed in Schedule 13.2:   (a) To Sellers\' Knowledge, since
February 26, 2001 each Seller has  materially complied at all times with, and
is currently in material  compliance with, all Environmental Laws and
Occupational Safety and Health  Laws applicable to its Business, and there
are no material Environmental,  Health and Safety Liabilities with respect to
its Business.   (b) To Sellers\' Knowledge, each Seller has all material
Permits  required for the ongoing conduct of its Business as it is currently
being  conducted. To Sellers\' Knowledge, there has been no commencement of
any  process by or before any Governmental Body to suspend, revoke,
materially  modify (other than modifications made in connection with a normal
renewal  of an expiring Permit) or cancel any such Permit, or any claims by
or  before any Governmental Body alleging or investigating any violations
of  Law, except where failure to have such Permit would not, individually or
in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed by Buyer
that  Sellers make no representations as to the transferability or
assignability  of any such Permit.   (c) There are no pending or, to
Sellers\' Knowledge, threatened claims,  Encumbrances, or other restrictions
resulting from any Environmental,  Health and Safety Liabilities or arising
under or pursuant to any  Environmental Law or Occupational Safety and Health
Law with respect to or  affecting any Facility or any of the Owned Real
Property or Leased Real  Property.   (d) To Sellers\' Knowledge, neither
the Owned Real Property nor the  Leased Real Property have been placed or are
proposed to be placed by the  United States Environmental Protection Agency
or equivalent state authority  on the National Priorities List or equivalent
state list, as in effect as  of the Closing Date.   (e) To Sellers\'
Knowledge, no Release or presence of Hazardous  Materials has occurred or is
occurring at the Facilities, the Owned Real  Property or the Leased Real
Property that presently requires notice,  further investigation or response
action under applicable Environmental  Laws.    70    (f) To Sellers\'
Knowledge, Sellers\' ownership and operation of the  Facilities, the Owned
Real Property and the Leased Real Property has not  involved the disposal,
transportation or arrangement for disposal or  transportation, of Hazardous
Materials at or to a site that, pursuant to  CERCLA or any equivalent state
law, has been placed or is proposed to be  placed by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent  state authority on the
National Priorities List or equivalent state list,  as in effect as of the
Closing Date.   (g) To Sellers\' Knowledge, Schedule 13.2(g) lists all
underground and  above ground storage tanks regulated as such under
Environmental Law (not  including process holding tanks, "drop" tanks and
similar tanks) located at  the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real
Property.   (h) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Schedules or
Exhibits  hereto to the contrary, Sellers have made available in the online
data room  to Buyer all material information, including without limitation
all  material environmental audit or assessment reports, bearing upon
material  Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities with respect to the 
Businesses, the Facilities, the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real 
Property, which are in Sellers\' possession or control or which are 
reasonably available to Sellers.   13.3 Conditions to Environmental
Indemnification and Cost Sharing.   (a) During the term of Sellers\'
obligations under this Article 13,  Buyer shall comply with Sellers\'
executory obligations set forth in the  documents identified on Exhibit A
which obligations (i) pertain to  operations at the Facilities, and (ii) are
necessary for the preservation  of environmental indemnity rights of Sellers
against third party  indemnitors ("Buyer\'s Environmental Covenants").  
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,  if
Buyer breaches any of Buyer\'s Environmental Covenants, Buyer shall 
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers\' Indemnified Persons from and 
against all provable Damages they may suffer, sustain or become subject to 
as a result of Buyer\'s breach of such covenants; provided that, for 
avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall have no such right to indemnification in 
the absence of actual prejudice of the rights or interests of Sellers  caused
by such breach; and provided further, that in the event Buyer\'s  breach of
any of Buyer\'s Environmental Covenants results in provable  Damages arising
with respect to any location other than the transferred  Facilities: (i)
Buyer shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of such  Damages, and (ii)
Buyer\'s share of such Damages shall not exceed $5,000,000  in the aggregate.
For avoidance of doubt, the Sellers\' Indemnified Persons  shall have the
right to injunctive relief set forth in Section 14.3, and  Sellers\' Damages
for a breach covered under this Section 13.3 shall include  any of Sellers\'
provable consequential damages arising from such breach by  Buyer.   (c) In
the event of an inconsistency between the definitions of terms  set forth in
the attached Exhibit A and the definitions of the same term  contained in
this Agreement, the terms of the attached provisions shall  control as they
relate to the attached covenants and only to the attached  covenants.   
71     (d) Buyer shall ensure that its Representatives, successors and 
assigns are aware of, and are obligated by contract to perform in  accordance
with Buyer\'s obligations set forth in Section 13.3(a).   13.4
Indemnification by Sellers and Cost Sharing. Subject to the conditions,
limitations and provisions set forth in Article 13:   (a) Breach of
Representation and Warranty. Subject to the applicable  provisions of Section
13.5, Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold  harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Persons from and against all Damages  (including Environmental
Costs and capital costs) they suffer, sustain or  become subject to as a
result of, in connection with, relating or  incidental to, or by virtue of a
breach of or inaccuracy in any  representation or warranty of Sellers set
forth in Section 13.2. For the  avoidance of doubt, a breach of Section 5.19
regarding environmental,  health and safety Permits shall be governed by this
Article 13 and not  Article 12.   (b) Defined Remediation Projects.   (i)
Existing Defined Remediation Projects. Schedule 13.4(b)(i)  describes the
environmental remediation projects at the Charlotte,  North Carolina,
Cincinnati, Ohio and Kalama, Washington Facilities  (collectively, the
"Defined Remediation Projects"). Subject to the  terms of this Section
13.4(b), Sellers shall be responsible for, shall  have the right to control,
shall diligently pursue Construction  Complete and all other required
actions, and shall indemnify, defend  and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Persons from and against all  Damages (including Environmental Costs and
capital costs) relating to  or arising from the Defined Remediation Projects
until December 31,  2011, subject to the provisions of Section
13.4(b)(vii).   (ii) New Defined Remediation Projects for Known Matters.
Subject  to the terms of this Section 13.4(b), Sellers shall be responsible 
for, shall have the right to control, shall diligently pursue  Construction
Complete and all other required actions, and shall  indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons from  and against all Damages
(including Environmental Costs and capital  costs) relating to or arising
from any action, including any  investigative or remedial action ordered by a
Governmental Body, for  any Known Environmental Matters arising with respect
to any of the  Facilities (the "New Defined Remediation Projects") until
December 31,  2011, subject to the provisions of Section 13.4(b)(vii). A
"Known  Environmental Matter" shall mean any environmental condition that
is  known and documented as being present at any Facility on or before the 
Closing Date, which for the avoidance of doubt shall include, without 
limitation, any environmental condition identified in the documents  made
available to Buyer pursuant to Section 7.27.   (iii) Operation and
Maintenance. Sellers shall be responsible  for, shall have the right to
control, and shall indemnify, defend and  hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Persons from and against all  Damages (including Environmental   
72     Costs) relating to or arising from any monitoring of
environmental  media, maintenance and repair of monitoring and remedial
facilities  and equipment, and any other operation and maintenance
activities  ("Operation and Maintenance") required in connection with the
Defined  Remediation Projects or New Defined Remediation Projects at any
time  after the Closing Date until December 31, 2011, subject to the 
provisions of Section 13.4(b)(vii).   (iv) Exclusivity of Subsection. Any
Damages (including  Environmental Costs) that do not relate to or arise from
the Defined  Remediation Projects, the New Defined Remediation Projects or
related  Operation and Maintenance shall not be subject to this Section 
13.4(b).   (v) Right of Control. (A) Sellers, or Sellers\' designee, shall 
have the right to control the Defined Remediation Projects and the New 
Defined Remediation Projects (which right of Sellers includes the  rights of
any of its third party indemnitors to control the Defined  Remediation
Projects or the New Defined Remediation Projects), and  shall have the right
to control the defense and resolution of any  claims asserted or threatened
by any Governmental Body in connection  with or arising from a Defined
Remediation Project or New Defined  Remediation Project subject to this
Section 13.4(b), subject only to  the limitation in the immediately following
sentence; (B) Sellers  shall provide Buyer with reasonable advance notice of,
and an  opportunity to comment on, any planned activities and any documents 
proposed to be submitted to any Governmental Body or other third  parties,
and an opportunity for Buyer to participate in any meetings  or material
negotiations with any third party (excluding counsel,  consultants or other
experts retained by the controlling party, unless  such party consents to
Buyer\'s participation), but Sellers shall have  the right to control the
process and all the decisions necessary  thereto shall be made in Sellers\'
sole and absolute discretion subject  only to the limitation in the
immediately following sentence; and (C)  Sellers\' rights and duties under
clauses (v)(A) and (B) above shall  not survive the termination of Sellers\'
indemnification obligations  under this Section 13.4(b). Notwithstanding
clauses (v)(A) and (B)  above, no compromise or settlement may be reached by
Sellers with  respect to a Defined Remediation Project or New Defined
Remediation  Project without Buyer\'s prior written consent, nor shall any
action  relating to any Defined Remediation Project or New Defined
Remediation  Project, which action may interfere with Buyer\'s operations, be
taken  without Buyer\'s prior written consent, in each case which shall not
be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, Buyer shall 
have such right to consent only to the extent such consent right does  not
conflict with or cause a breach under Sellers\' right to  indemnification
from any third party, and further provided that Buyer  is not in violation of
any material term under this Article 13  relating to the subject matter of
the consent.   (vi) Termination Date of Sellers\' Indemnity. Subject to
Buyer\'s  rights under Section 13.4(d), Sellers\' obligations under this
Section  13.4(b) shall terminate on December 31, 2011, except with respect
to  any claims asserted prior to December 31, 2011 which remain pending as 
of such date, for which Seller\'s    73     responsibility, right to
control and indemnification obligations shall  continue until the final
resolution of such matter; provided, however,  that the Buyer Indemnified
Person\'s indemnification rights against  Sellers with respect to such claims
asserted prior to December 31,  2011 and pending as of such date shall be to
the extent and for the  duration of Sellers\' actual recovery under the
Agreement for Sale and  Purchase of Assets between The B.F. Goodrich Company
and PMD Group,  Inc. dated November 28, 2000 for such matters (the "Pass
Through  Indemnity"). In furtherance of the foregoing, with regard to the
Pass  Through Indemnity, Buyer shall present to Sellers information 
reasonably necessary for Sellers to seek the applicable  indemnification from
its third party indemnitors, and Sellers shall  diligently pursue and
undertake all actions requested by the  applicable Buyer Indemnified Person
to secure the indemnity therefor  from its third party indemnitors, provided
that in the event  litigation is required to secure the indemnity, the
applicable Buyer  Indemnified Person shall indemnify Sellers for any actual
out of  pocket fees or expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with 
litigation requested by Buyers.   (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision
herein to the contrary,  for the avoidance of doubt, Seller\'s
indemnification obligations  hereunder with respect to any Defined
Remediation Project, New Defined  Remediation Project, or related Operation
and Maintenance shall not be  subject to any deductible, cap, or other
monetary limitation.   (c) Unknown Environmental Liabilities.   (i)
Sellers Indemnity for Unknowns. Except for matters expressly  indemnified by
Sellers in Sections 13.4(a) or 13.4(b), all of which  shall be governed
exclusively by such express indemnity, and subject  to the Allowable
Environmental Cost threshold of $50,000 set forth in  Section 13.5(a),
Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the  Buyer Indemnified
Persons for fifty percent (50%) of all Damages  (including Environmental
Costs and capital costs) for Environmental,  Health and Safety Liabilities
relating to the Facilities and the  ownership and operation of the Businesses
conducted thereon, in each  case to the extent arising from facts, events or
conditions caused or  occurring on or prior to the Closing Date and only to
such extent  (including off-site treatment, storage or disposal locations
used by  or in connection with the ownership or operation of such
Businesses  during such period) ("Unknown Environmental Liabilities");
provided,  for the avoidance of doubt, that Buyer\'s fifty percent (50%)
share of  such liabilities shall be further limited as set forth in Section 
13.4(c)(ii).   (ii) Limitations of Buyer\'s Assumption of Unknown
Environmental  Liabilities. Buyer\'s share of Environmental Costs for
Unknown  Environmental Liabilities shall not exceed $1,000,000 in any one 
calendar year or $5 million in the aggregate; by way of example: in  the
event of a $3 million Unknown Environmental Liability indemnified  pursuant
to Section 13.4(c), Buyer and Sellers would each pay 50% of  the first $2
million, after which Sellers would be responsible for the  remaining $1
million. Any Damages (including    74     Environmental Costs and
capital costs) not indemnified by Seller  because the $50,000 threshold
amount is not exceeded shall nonetheless  be included for the purposes of
calculating Buyer\'s $1,000,000 and  $5,000,000 liability limits
hereunder.   (iii) Termination Date of Sellers\' Indemnity. Sellers\' 
obligations under this Section 13.4(c) shall terminate on December 31,  2011,
except as to valid indemnity claims asserted prior to December  31, 2011
which remain pending as of December 31, 2011 (which claims,  for the
avoidance of doubt, relate to Unknown Environmental  Liabilities, the facts,
events or conditions underlying which occurred  on or prior to the Closing
Date, and only to such extent), in which  case Seller\'s obligations shall
survive until final resolution of such  matter; provided, however, in the
case such claims relate to  subsurface contamination at any Facility
requiring remediation and  subsequent Operation and Maintenance, Sellers\'
obligations hereunder  with respect to such Operation and Maintenance shall
terminate upon  the later date of either (x) Construction Complete or (y)
December 31,  2011, after which date Buyer shall be responsible for such
Operation  and Maintenance.   (d) Sellers\' Breach of Prior Covenants.
Notwithstanding any other  provision contained in this Agreement, if Sellers
breach any of the  executory obligations in the documents identified in the
attached Exhibit A  which obligations are necessary for the preservation of
environmental  indemnity rights of Sellers against third party indemnitors
("Sellers\'  Environmental Covenants"), Sellers shall indemnify and hold
harmless the  Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against all provable Damages
(including  Environmental Costs) they may suffer, sustain or become subject
to as a  result of Sellers\' breach; provided that, for avoidance of doubt,
Buyer  Indemnified Persons shall have no such right to indemnification in
the  absence of actual prejudice of the rights or interests of Buyer caused
by  such breach. Buyer\'s damages for a breach under this Section shall
include  any of Buyer\'s provable consequential damages arising from such
breach by  Sellers.   (e) Acknowledgement of Indemnity by Noveon and
Lubrizol. Buyer,  Noveon, and Lubrizol acknowledge that the indemnifications
to be provided  by Sellers pursuant to this Article 13 shall be provided on
behalf of all  Sellers by Noveon, and to the extent Noveon fails to provide
such  indemnification, Lubrizol and Noveon and Lubrizol are the only
Parties  available to Buyer for claims pursuant to this Article 13 of 
indemnification against the Sellers.   13.5 Limitations on
Indemnification.   (a) Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder with  respect to any Damages (including Environmental Costs)
indemnifiable under  Sections 13.4(a) or 13.4(c) (each a "Basic Environmental
Indemnity" and,  collectively, the "Basic Environmental Indemnities"), unless
the particular  indemnifiable Damages (including Environmental Costs) exceeds
$50,000 (each  an "Allowable Environmental Cost" and, collectively, the
"Allowable  Environmental Costs"), with it being understood that all   
75     Damages (including Environmental Costs) relating to claims arising
out of  the same set of operative facts shall be considered an individual
claim for  purposes of this Agreement and such items shall be aggregated for
purposes  of this proviso.   (b) Noveon and Lubrizol shall not have any
obligation to indemnify any  Buyer Indemnified Persons for Allowable
Environmental Costs specified in  Section 13.4(a) unless and until such Buyer
Indemnified Persons have  incurred Allowable Environmental Costs in an
aggregate amount in excess of  $2,500,000, in which event such Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled  to be indemnified for the entire
amount of such aggregate Allowable  Environmental Costs. The Parties agree
and acknowledge that for purposes of  satisfying the $2,500,000 threshold set
forth in this Section 13.5(b) that  indemnification obligations for Allowable
Damages incurred under Section  12.2(a) shall not apply toward the
satisfaction of such threshold.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary,  Sellers\' aggregate indemnity obligation for
Allowable Environmental Costs  indemnifiable under the Basic Environmental
Indemnities, when aggregated  with its indemnification obligations for
Damages incurred under Section  12.2(a), shall in no event exceed ten percent
(10%) of the Purchase Price;  and no claim for indemnification of
Environmental Costs under the Basic  Environmental Indemnities shall be made
hereunder by Buyer to the extent  the aggregate Allowable Environmental Costs
claimed (including any  Environmental Costs previously recovered and
indemnifiable Damages incurred  under Section 12.2(a)) by the Buyer, taken as
a whole, exceed ten percent  (10%) of the Purchase Price; provided however,
for the avoidance of doubt:  (i) Seller\'s indemnification obligations under
Section 13.4(b) with respect  to Defined Remediation Projects, New Defined
Remediation Projects and  related Operation and Maintenance shall not be
subject to any threshold,  deductible, cap or other monetary limitation, (ii)
Seller\'s indemnification  obligations with respect to Pre-Closing Toxic Tort
Liabilities and Former  Facilities (and any related offsite disposal
Liabilities) shall not be  subject to any limitation as to time or
amount.   (d) The indemnity obligation set forth in Section 13.4(a), and
the  underlying representation and warranty set forth in Section 13.2,
shall  survive the Closing hereunder for a period of 24 months after the
date  hereof, and thereafter except for claims reported prior to such date, 
Sellers shall have no responsibility or Liability with respect to any  claims
arising under Section 13.4(a) or Section 13.2. Any claim for  indemnification
with respect to any such matters which is not asserted by  notice given as
herein provided within such specified period of survival  may not be pursued.
Any indemnity claim so asserted within such period of  survival will be
timely made for purposes hereof, and Seller\'s obligation  therewith, if any,
shall continue until its final resolution.   (e) Any corrective actions or
resolution resulting from a validated  indemnity claim made under the Basic
Environmental Indemnities must be  diligently pursued by Buyer in good faith
to prompt completion. Any  corrective actions or resolution resulting from a
validated indemnity claim  made under Section 13.4(b) must be diligently
pursued by Sellers in good  faith to prompt completion.    76     (f)
Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder with  respect to any
particular Damages (including Environmental Costs) to the  extent (but only
to the extent) the matter giving rise to such Damages  (including
Environmental Costs) resulted in an adjustment (in favor of  Buyer) to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.3 above.   (g) Sellers shall not be
obligated to indemnify Buyer pursuant to  Article 13 to the extent
Environmental Costs result from Buyer\'s  unreasonable disturbance of the
areas identified on Schedule 13.5(g) that  are subject to long-term closure
requirements under Environmental Laws.   (h) Except as set forth in Section
13.5(d), Sellers shall have no  obligation of indemnification pursuant to
Article 13 after the termination  of the indemnification in accordance with
the express terms of such  indemnification.   (i) Sellers shall have no
obligation of indemnification for  Environmental Matters specified in the
Basic Environmental Indemnities to  the extent Environmental, Health and
Safety Liabilities arise as the result  of applicable regulatory standards
that are not in effect at the Closing.  However, with respect to any such
Environmental Matters which arise under  such standards in effect at the
Closing, Sellers\' obligations shall be  deemed extinguished only upon
completing such remedial action as is  required under the regulatory
standards in effect at the time such remedial  action is undertaken. For the
avoidance of doubt, the preceding provisions  shall not apply to the Defined
Remediation Projects or the New Defined  Remediation Projects, for which
Sellers shall be responsible for completing  any and all required
actions.   (j) Except as provided otherwise herein, Sellers shall have no 
Liability whatsoever pursuant to the Basic Environmental Indemnities with 
respect to any Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities properly set 
forth in Section 13.2 hereof, and the accompanying schedules hereto, to the 
extent and only to the extent specifically and explicitly identified 
therein.   (k) For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall have no obligation
of  indemnification for Liabilities to the extent, and only to such extent, 
arising from New Environmental Conditions or from Buyer\'s Exacerbation of 
Pre-Existing Conditions.   13.6 Cincinnati Site. Sellers hereby assign, from
and after the Closing Date, all of its rights under the Environmental Matters
Agreement among Freedom Chemical Acquisition Corporation, Hilton Davis
Chemical Co., and Sterling Winthrop, Inc. dated September 9, 1993 in relation
to the Cincinnati, Ohio Facility, a copy of which and associated documents
are attached hereto as Exhibit B (referred to collectively hereafter as the
"Environmental Matters Agreement"). Buyer hereby agrees to, from and after
the Closing Date, comply with and assume, fully discharge and fully perform
all of Hilton Davis\' executory obligations as set forth in the Environmental
Matters Agreement including such requirements as management of Hazardous
Materials, release of information, cooperation, and transfer of ownership;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that in accordance with Section
13.4(b), Sellers shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless against all Damages (including Environmental Costs) relating to or
arising from the Defined Remediation Project, any New Defined   
77    Remediation Project, and any related Operation and Maintenance with
respect to the Cincinnati Facility, notwithstanding any terms to the contrary
in the Environmental Matters Agreement or otherwise.   13.7 Third-Party
Indemnitors; Actions.   (a) Sellers shall have the right to control the
defense, negotiation  or resolution of any matter as to which indemnification
is provided by  Sellers under Section 13.4(b) in accordance with the terms
and Buyer  consent provisions set forth therein; provided that as to any
remedy which  is being conducted in whole or in part at Sellers\' expense
pursuant to this  Article 13 or any third-party agreement, Sellers, or its or
their  Affiliates, are permitted to control and define the remedy, which may
be  conducted in the "Lowest-Cost Commercially Reasonable" manner, which,
for  purposes of this Agreement, shall mean the cost effective methods for 
investigation, remediation, removal, corrective action, containment or 
monitoring permitted by applicable Environmental Laws determined from the 
perspective of a reasonable business person acting (without regard to the 
availability of indemnification hereunder) to achieve compliance with 
applicable Environmental Law or to minimize Liability under Environmental 
Laws or to third parties, it being understood that such Lowest-Cost 
Commercially Reasonable manner shall, where appropriate, include the use of 
risk-based remedies, institutional or engineering controls or deed 
restrictions to the extent such controls or restrictions do not  unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations upon the affected  Facility, it being
further understood that, in the event of an actual  conflict between: (A) a
requirement under applicable Environmental Law or  an Order, direction or
mandate by a Governmental Body, and (B) what would  otherwise be a Lowest-
Cost Commercially Reasonable manner, the requirement,  Order, direction or
mandate shall be deemed the Lowest-Cost Commercially  Reasonable manner.  
(b) Buyer shall have the right to control the defense, negotiation or 
resolution of any matter as to which indemnification is provided under 
Sections 13.4(a) and 13.4(c); provided that Buyer shall provide the Sellers 
with reasonable advance notice of, and an opportunity to comment on, any 
planned activities and any documents proposed to be submitted to any 
Governmental Body or other third parties, and an opportunity for Sellers to 
participate in any meetings or material negotiations with any Governmental 
Body or third party (excluding counsel, consultants or other experts 
retained by Buyer), and no compromise or settlement may be reached by Buyer 
with regard to such matter (or any related third party claim) without 
Sellers written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  or
delayed).   13.8 Indemnification of Sellers by Buyer. Buyer shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from and against all Damages (including
any Environmental Costs) suffered or incurred by Sellers to the extent, and
only to such extent, resulting from: (i) New Environmental Conditions; (ii)
Buyer\'s Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Conditions; or (iii) any and all
Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities with respect to the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property, in each case above, to the extent not
otherwise expressly retained or indemnified by Sellers in this Agreement.
Buyer agrees that, except as otherwise provided herein, this Section 13.8
shall survive the Closing indefinitely. For the purposes of this   
78    Agreement: (x) "New Environmental Conditions" shall mean any
environmental condition at any Facility occurring solely after the Closing
Date and during the Buyer\'s ownership or operation of such Facility; (y)
"Buyer\'s Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Conditions" shall mean any actions or
omissions outside the Ordinary Course of Business at any Facility by or on
behalf of Buyer (such as Buyer\'s voluntary invasive subsurface sampling,
excavation or redevelopment of a portion of a Facility) or by any other
Person (such as Buyer\'s contractors and agents, or vandals and other
uninvited third parties), to the extent (and only to the extent) such actions
exacerbate or increase the remedial cost associated with any environmental
condition occurring or in existence at any Facility prior to the Closing Date
(including the Defined Remediation Projects); provided, however, that
Buyer\'s Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Conditions shall not include any
unsolicited governmental actions (such as governmental Orders or
inspections that result in a cleanup requirement), third party claims, or any
actions required by Law; and provided further, that nothing herein shall be
deemed an assumption by Buyer of any liabilities arising under CERCLA or any
other Environmental, Health and Safety Laws accruing to Buyer merely by
virtue of Buyer\'s status as the owner or operator of a Facility.   13.9
Environmental Matters Procedure.   Any claim for indemnification or
reimbursement sought pursuant to this Article 13 by an Indemnitee shall be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonable prompt written notice
thereof, stating the nature of such claim in reasonable detail and indicating
the estimated amount, if practicable, and the Indemnifying Party shall have a
period of thirty (30) days within which to respond to such claim. if the
Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, the Parties covenant and agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve their dispute with respect to such
claim within thirty (30) days of receipt of such written notice. If despite
such commercially reasonable efforts, the Parties are unable to resolve their
dispute, such dispute shall be promptly submitted to arbitration pursuant to
Article 14. Buyer agrees at the reasonable request of
Sellers\' Representative, and Noveon and Lubrizol each agree at the
reasonable request of Buyer, to modify the procedures set forth in this
Section 13.9 to maximize the ability of the Parties to recover for
indemnification claims under the agreements set forth on Exhibit A.   13.10
Access to Business. From the Closing Date until the termination of all
obligations of Sellers under this Article 13, Buyer shall allow Sellers
or its designees and its or their Representatives and Affiliates to have
reasonable access to personnel, the premises and to the properties, books and
records of Buyer as is reasonably necessary to protect Sellers\' rights,
perform Sellers\' obligations and investigate claims made under this Article
13, during normal working hours, provided Sellers give Buyer at least 48
hours advance notice and such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Buyer.   13.11 Environmental Matters Dispute
Resolution. In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of
or related to this Article 13, or a breach hereof, whether based in contract,
tort, or statute, including as to interpretation, scope, formation,
performance or termination ("Environmental Matters Dispute"), the Parties
shall settle such Environmental Matters Dispute in accordance with the
procedure set forth in Article 14; provided, however, that the Parties shall
agree to temporarily halt the Environmental Matters Dispute proceedings
and    79    allow for executive management discussions and
negotiations between Buyer and Sellers prior to proceeding to
arbitration.   13.12 Amount of Claims; Insurance; Tax Benefits.   (a)
Insurance. To the extent that any Environmental Costs are covered  by
insurance held by Buyer, Buyer shall only be entitled to indemnification 
pursuant to Section 13.4 hereof only with respect to the amount of 
Environmental Costs in excess of the net insurance proceeds actually 
received (after deduction for any cost of collection, deductible, 
retroactive premium adjustment, reimbursement obligation or other cost 
directly related to such insurance claim) by Buyer pursuant to such 
insurance. With respect to such insured loss, Buyer shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to obtain recovery from the provider of such insurance; 
provided that Buyer shall have no obligation to seek recovery under any 
insurance policy to the extent that any claims against such insurance  policy
for such Environmental Costs would result in an increase in the  premium for
such insurance policy or in cancellation of such policy.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer may pursue recovery  hereunder prior
to the resolution of any such insurance claim, and Sellers  shall pay to
Buyer such amounts as it would otherwise be obligated to pay  to Buyer
without respect to this Section 13.12 and prior to such time as  Buyer has
determined whether such Environmental Costs are covered (or not  covered) by
insurance held by Buyer. If, following the receipt of any  indemnity payments
pursuant to Section 13.12(b), Buyer obtains any  insurance recovery from a
third party insurance provider, then Buyer shall  promptly pay over to
Sellers the net amount of the proceeds received by  Buyer (after deduction
for any cost of collection, deductible, retroactive  premium adjustment,
reimbursement obligation or other cost directly related  to such insurance
claim) pursuant to such insurance up to, but not in  excess of, the amount of
the indemnification claim paid by Sellers.   (b) Tax Benefit. To the extent
that Buyer recognizes Tax Benefits as a  result of any indemnification under
this Article 13, Buyer shall pay an  amount equal to the amount of such Tax
Benefits (but not in excess of the  indemnification payment or payments
actually received from Sellers with  respect to such Environmental Costs) to
Sellers when such Tax Benefits are  actually recognized by Buyer. Buyer shall
pay the amount of such Tax  Benefits to Sellers within ten (10) days of
filing any Tax Return  reflecting a Tax Benefit. For this purpose, Buyer
shall be deemed to  recognize a Tax Benefit with respect to a taxable year
if, and to the  extent that, Buyer\'s cumulative liability for Taxes through
the end of such  taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items
attributable to the  Environmental Costs and the receipt of any
indemnification payments from  all taxable years, exceeds Buyer\'s actual
cumulative liability for Taxes  through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by taking into account any  Tax items attributable to the
Environmental Costs and the receipt of any  indemnification payments for all
taxable years (to the extent permitted by  relevant Tax law and not already
taken into account for a previous taxable  year pursuant to this Section
13.12(b) and treating such Tax items as the  last items claimed for any
taxable year).    80     13.13 Adjustment to Purchase Price for Tax
Purposes. It is the intent of the Parties that any amounts paid under this
Article 13 will represent an adjustment of the Purchase Price, and the
Parties will report such payments consistent with such intent.   ARTICLE
14  DISPUTE RESOLUTION   14.1 Dispute Resolution. Except as provided in
Sections 4.3 and 14.3, in the event of any dispute, controversy or claim
arising out of or related to this Agreement or a breach hereof, whether based
in contract, tort, or statute, including its interpretation, scope,
formation, performance or termination ("Dispute"), the Parties shall settle
such Dispute in accordance with the following:   (a) Friendly Discussions.
In the event of any dispute or disagreement  between Sellers and Buyer as to
the interpretation of any provision of this  Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby (or the performance  of any obligations
hereunder or thereunder), the matter, upon written  request of either Party,
shall be referred to representatives of the  Parties for decision, each Party
being represented by a senior executive  officer who has no direct
operational responsibility for the matters  contemplated by this Agreement.
The representatives shall promptly meet and  use commercially reasonable
efforts to settle the Dispute by consulting and  negotiating with each other
in good faith to reach a just and equitable  solution satisfactory to all
Parties;   (b) Arbitration. If the Dispute is not resolved through
friendly  discussions within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the Dispute
is  referred to the Parties\' representatives, the Dispute shall be finally 
resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration  Association
(the "AAA") in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.2  and the AAA\'s
then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the  Emergency Interim
Relief Procedures (and, in the case of any Dispute  involving a claim in
excess of $500,000 (a "Large Dispute"), the  Supplementary Procedures for
Large, Complex Disputes), and judgment on the  award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having  jurisdiction thereof. In the
case of conflict between the AAA\'s  then-current Commercial Arbitration
Rules and Section 14.2, Section 14.2  shall control.   14.2 Arbitration.
The following provisions shall apply to any arbitration hereunder:   (a)
Number and Appointment of Arbitrators. With respect to any Dispute  which is
not a Large Dispute, the arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) 
independent and impartial arbitrator appointed by Sellers and Buyer (or, if 
they cannot agree, by the AAA). In the case of any Large Dispute, the 
arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators. Within ten (10) 
days following the commencement of arbitration of a Large Dispute, Sellers\' 
Representative shall select one (1) arbitrator and Buyer shall select one 
(1) arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so selected shall select a  third
arbitrator. If the two (2) arbitrators are unable to agree to the  third
arbitrator within ten (10) days, a third arbitrator shall be  appointed by
the AAA;    81     (b) Location of Arbitration; Governing Law. The
arbitration shall take  place in a forum mutually agreed upon by the Parties,
provided that the  arbitration may not take place in Lake County, Ohio,
Cuyahoga County, Ohio,  Cook County, Illinois, and Palm Beach County,
Florida. The Law of the state  of Delaware shall govern all questions
concerning the construction,  validity, interpretation and enforceability of
this Agreement and the  Schedules attached hereto, and the performance of the
obligations imposed  by this Agreement, without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflict  of law rules or provisions (whether of the state of
Delaware or any other  jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any  jurisdiction other than the state of Delaware. The Parties
acknowledge that  this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
commerce and  that the United States Arbitration Act shall govern the
interpretation and  enforcement of, and any Proceedings under, the
arbitration provisions  hereof;   (c) Language. The language of the
arbitration shall be English;   (d) Discovery. The arbitrator shall permit
and facilitate such  discovery as the Parties shall reasonably request. The
Parties shall keep  confidential any Confidential Information or other non-
public information  disclosed in discovery;   (e) Damages. The arbitrator
shall be expressly empowered to award to  any party any Damages in connection
with any dispute between them arising  out of or relating in any way to this
Agreement or the other agreements  contemplated hereby or the transactions
arising out of or relating in any  way to this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby or the  transactions arising hereunder or
thereunder, and each Party hereby  irrevocably waives any objection to such
recovery by any other Party  hereto.   (f) Fees and Expenses. The fees,
expenses and costs of the arbitration  shall be shared equally by the Parties
and advanced by them from time to  time as required; provided that at the
conclusion of the arbitration, the  arbitrator shall award costs and expenses
(including the costs of the  arbitration previously advanced and the fees and
expenses of attorneys,  accountants and other experts) and interest at the
prime rate prime rate as  quoted in The Wall Street Journal on the date of
determination of the  arbitrators final judgment to Sellers and Buyer pro
rata in an inverse  proportion to the extent (by dollar value) to which the
award agrees with  such Party\'s position, such amounts to be determined by
the arbitrator(s)  at the time of the award;   (g) Final Judgment. The
award rendered by the arbitrator shall be  final and not subject to judicial
review, and judgment thereon may be  entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.   (h) International Enforcement. The arbitral award shall be
enforceable  under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of  Foreign Arbitral Awards; and    82    (i) Continuing
Performance. Performance of this Agreement shall  continue unabated during
the pending of any arbitration which may  arise out of a Dispute, except with
regard to the matter in Dispute.   14.3 Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Article 14 to the contrary and without prejudice
to the procedures set forth in Article 14, each Party shall have the right to
institute judicial Proceedings against another Party or anyone acting by,
through or under such Party, in any court of competent jurisdiction for
temporary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief (including through
reformation of contract, specific performance, injunction or similar
equitable relief) if such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or
to preserve the status quo until such time as the arbitration panel is
convened and available to hear such party\'s request for temporary relief.
Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be
damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached.   ARTICLE 15  GENERAL PROVISIONS   15.1 Expenses. Except as

Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within
such state, without regard to conflict of laws rules thereof. Subject to the
provisions of Article 14, the Parties agree that any action brought by any
Party shall be brought and resolved exclusively by state and federal courts
other than those located in Lake County, Ohio, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Cook
County, Illinois, and Palm Beach County, Florida, and the courts to which an
appeal therefrom may be taken. Each of the Parties hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts and waives all questions of jurisdiction and
venue. The Parties agree that either or both of them may file a copy of
this    84    Section 15.4 with any court as written evidence of the
knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement between the Parties irrevocably to
waive any objections to jurisdiction venue or to convenience of forum. Legal
process in any Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the
world.   15.5 Waiver. Neither any failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as
a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise
of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by the Party
against whom it is sought to be enforced. A waiver of any provision by any
Party on one occasion shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the same or any
other breach on a future occasion.   15.6 Entire Agreement; Modification.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral,
between the Parties with respect to its subject matter (including any letter
of intent) and constitutes (along with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and
the Transaction Documents) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of
the agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a
written agreement executed by the Party to be charged with the amendment.  
15.7 Assignment, Successors; No Third Parties. No Party may assign any of its
rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without
the express written consent of the Buyer (or its permitted assigns) or
Sellers\' Representative (or its permitted assigns), as applicable, which
consent will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Buyer\'s (or its permitted assign\'s) proposed assignment
includes the assignment of Buyer\'s (or its permitted assign\'s) rights or
obligations under Article 13, Noveon\'s reasonable good faith belief that the
proposed assignee is not qualified to perform Buyer\'s (or its permitted
assign\'s) obligations under Article 13 or operate the assigned asset or
assets according to standards of reasonable environmental compliance,
Sellers\' Representative may withhold consent to the proposed assignment. If
Sellers\' Representative withholds consent to the proposed assignment, Buyer
(or its permitted assign) may dispute such withholding of consent in
accordance with the dispute resolution process set forth in Article 14, and
the Arbitrator shall be instructed to make a determination on the matter
within 60 days of the filing of the Dispute. Subject to the consent of
Sellers\' Representative as set forth above, this Agreement will apply to, be
binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and
permitted assigns of the Parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement shall be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to
this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except
such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to
this Section 15.7. Subject to the consent of Sellers\' Representative (or
its successors) set forth above, it is expressly agreed that Buyer (or its
permitted assign) may assign its rights and obligations in whole or in part
and that upon any permitted assignment, Buyer (or its permitted assign) shall
be released from any and all Liabilities and obligations hereunder which are
assumed by Buyer\'s (or its permitted assign\'s) permitted assign. It is
further agreed that any assignment not consented to by Sellers\'
Representative (or its successor) of Buyer\'s (or its permitted assign\'s)
rights under Article 13    85    shall require that the proposed
assignee of Buyer (or its permitted assign) assumes the obligations set forth
in Article 13 (including the obligation set forth in Article 13 to comply
with the covenants set forth in Exhibit A). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer (or its permitted assign) may assign in whole or in part its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the Closing Documents (including
the right to purchase the Purchased Assets and the Purchased IP Assets, the
benefits and obligations under the Closing Documents, and the obligation to
assume the Assumed Liabilities) to one or more of its Affiliates, and Buyer
(or its permitted assign) may, in its sole discretion, direct Sellers or IP
Sellers to convey the Purchased Assets or the Purchased IP Assets and license
the Licensed IP, in whole or in part, to one or more of its Affiliates;
provided if Sellers\' Representative does not consent to such assignment to
Buyer\'s Affiliates, Buyer shall remain obligated (and shall not be released)
from its obligations hereunder; provided, further, for this sentence only,
the reference to ten percent (10%) in the definition of "Affiliate" shall be
deemed to be fifty percent (50%). Buyer (or its permitted assign) may
assign this Agreement and the Closing Documents, including any rights
to indemnification, and its obligations pursuant thereto to any of its
lender(s) as collateral security; provided if Sellers\' Representative does
not consents to any assignment of Buyer\'s (or its permitted assign\'s)
lender(s), Buyer (or its permitted assign\'s) shall remain obligated (and
shall not be released) from its obligations hereunder.   15.8 Exhibits and
Schedules; Construction of Certain Provisions. The Exhibits and Schedules
referred to in this Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been set forth in
their entirety herein. Each disclosure in the Schedules shall be deemed to
qualify all representations and warranties of Sellers and IP Sellers made
herein, notwithstanding the lack of a specific cross reference, but only
to the extent that its applicability to a particular representation,
warranty, agreement or condition is reasonably apparent from the face of the
disclosure thereof. It is understood and agreed that (1) the specification of
any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Exhibits or Schedules
is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included or other items, are or are not material, and (2) except as
expressly provided herein, the listing or disclosure of an item on the
Schedules shall not be deemed to create an Assumed Liability or any other
Liability for Buyer. All Schedules attached hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein.   15.9 Construction. The Parties acknowledge that they and
their respective lawyers and counsel have negotiated and drafted this
Agreement jointly and agree that the rule of construction that ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in the
interpretation or construction of this Agreement.   15.10 Severability. If
for any reason whatsoever, any one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be held or deemed to be inoperative, illegal, unenforceable
or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction as applied to any particular
case or in all cases, such circumstances shall not have the effect
of rendering such provision invalid in any other case or of rendering any of
the provisions of this Agreement inoperative, illegal, unenforceable or
invalid. Furthermore, in lieu of such inoperative, illegal, unenforceable or
invalid provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as    86    similar
in terms to such inoperative, illegal, unenforceable or invalid provision as
may be possible.   15.11 Time Periods. Unless specified otherwise, any
action required hereunder to be taken within a certain number of days shall
be taken within that number of calendar days (and not business days);
provided, however, that if the last day for taking such action falls on a
weekend or a holiday in the United States, the period during which such
action may be taken shall be automatically extended to the next business
day.   15.12 Execution of Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile or electronic mail transmission
shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the
Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all
purposes.   15.13 Checks Outstanding. Sellers shall cause all "cut" but
