DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

Section 3.01 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a
customary paying agent agreement with a nationally recognized commercial bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Shares who exchange their
Shares in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ III_. Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the

 



14

    

 holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_
promptly after the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ (such
cash, the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for
any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the
amounts described in the preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost
portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or losses thereon
shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this _Article_ __ _
III_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Shares, no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and, following any losses,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in the
amount of any such losses. Any interest or other income from such investments
shall be paid to and become income of Parent. Except as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than as specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_. The Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Shares and the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Shares.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_: (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall
be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Shares to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal.

(ii) Upon (A) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, properly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or
(B) receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, and, in each case, such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.04(a)_ and this _Article_ __ _ III_, in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such holders Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Merger Consideration may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing
such Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ and this 

 



15

    

  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender, without interest, the Merger Consideration, except as
otherwise provided by applicable Law.

(c) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ III_ upon conversion
of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Shares.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares on the date that is twelve months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, upon demand, and any
holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _
III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent as a general creditor for the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Payment Fund or other cash properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares
as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Shares such
amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder,
any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_.

Section 3.02 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled and
exchanged solely for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_.

 



16

    

Section 3.03 _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, any
restricted stock units providing for a right to receive Shares (the " _Company
Restricted Stock Units_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition under the Companys 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended,
supplemented or modified (the " _Company Stock Plan_ ") or any applicable
award agreement or other agreement with the Company shall, as of the
Effective Time, whether granted prior to the date of this Agreement or granted
after the date of this Agreement as permitted by this Agreement, become fully
vested and nonforfeitable and shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Unit, subject to applicable Tax withholding and
other authorized deductions, which shall be paid or provided by Parent as soon
as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the Closing Date. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions
as may reasonably be appropriate or required in its discretion to effectuate
the actions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_.

 

Section 3.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a
holder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares and otherwise properly
perfected and not withdrawn or lost his or her rights (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ and this  _Article_ __ _ III_ and shall
no longer be Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of
such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall
cease. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company
relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall give Parent
and Merger Sub the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such
demands.

prior to the vote of the Companys stockholders regarding the adoption of the
Agreement at the Company Stockholders 

 



43

Meeting (x) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the

provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may grant a waiver of, and shall not be obligated to enforce, any such
provision (i) solely to the extent necessary to permit a party to submit
a confidential Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board, (ii) if the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to grant such waiver or to decide not to so enforce
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(iii) if the Company promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notifies
Parent of any such waiver or decision not to enforce.

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, during the

7.03_ or (iii) execute or enter into any Acquisition Agreement; _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may grant a waiver,

made to the Company or the Company Board so long as (x) the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that

 



44

    

 the failure to grant such waiver, amendment or release would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company promptly
(and, in any event, within 24 hours) notifies Parent of any such waiver,
amendment or release; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
7.03_ shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from furnishing
information to, or engaging in discussions, communications or negotiations
with, any Person that made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of this _Section_ __
_ 7.03_, if, and only if, prior to taking such action referred to in clauses
(ii) and (iii) above, (A) the Company Board (1) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal

determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company provides written notice
to Parent of the determination referenced in clause (A) promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours of such determination), and (C) the Company receives
from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company

Proposal and (ii) disclose to Parent the identity of such Person making, and
an unredacted copy of, any such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry,
proposal or offer made in writing (or, if made orally, a reasonably detailed
description of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer). The
Company shall, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof (and, in any event,
within 48 hours), provide Parent with copies of all drafts and final versions
of definitive or other agreements including schedules and exhibits thereto
(which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal) relating to such
Acquisition Proposal, in each case exchanged between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any
event, within 48 hours of any material development) of the status and details
(including with respect to any change in price or other material amendments)
of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, proposal or offer
concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and, in any

adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation; (ii) endorse,

 



45

    

 approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) enter into any
Acquisition Agreement; or (iv) refrain from recommending against (and
reaffirming the Company Recommendation) any Acquisition Proposal that is a
tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement thereof (any such action, other than those set forth in the
preceding clause (iii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ to
the contrary, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and so
long as the Company is not then in breach (or deemed breach) of this _Section_
__ _ 7.03_, (i) if the Company receives an unsolicited, written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside advisors) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change if a Company Intervening Event occurs and as a
result thereof the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that:

 

(A) prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, (w) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to
take such actions, (x) the Company has provided Parent a summary of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, which shall include
all of the information that is specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(c)_, (y) if
requested to do so by Parent, for a period of three (3) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Representatives of the
Company available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its
Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and (z) no earlier than the end of such three
(3) calendar day period, the Company Board (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor), shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification
to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such three (3) calendar day
period, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement in connection therewith
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material
terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder
shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to
any such subsequent notices references herein to a "three (3) calendar day
period" shall be deemed to be references to a "two (2) calendar day period");
and

 



46

    

 (B) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
a Company Intervening Event, (x) the Company has notified Parent in writing
that it intends to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) if
requested to do so by Parent, for a period of three (3) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Representatives of the
Company available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its
Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (z) no earlier than the end of such three (3)
calendar day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such three (3) calendar day period, that
the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company Board
determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be
made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.03(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
a factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto (without including a reaffirmation) shall not be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(ii)_ with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer or indication of
interest from any Person or group (other than Parent or Merger Sub) relating
to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (A) any direct
or indirect acquisition of (x) more than 15% of the assets (whether based on
the fair market value, revenue generation or net income) of the Company and

materially less favorable to the Persons covered by such policies maintained

or in the case of Parent, any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03_
not to be satisfied, during the Pre-Closing Period and (ii) any failure of the

or commitments in connection with any such necessary consents, approvals or
waivers without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Each party hereto agrees to

its respective filings and

financial condition or result of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) __ the anticipated economic benefit or
value that Parent reasonably expects to be realized from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and
its Affiliates shall not be required (and Parent shall not require the
Company to, and the Company shall not be required to), take any action with
respect to any order or any applicable Law which is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger. Parent shall be entitled to direct the defense of

clearances. Neither Parent nor Company shall agree to participate in any
meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority
in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of an

purpose of financing the Transactions or any transaction undertaken in
connection therewith (it being understood that the receipt of any such

 any such legal privilege), or (vii) prevent the prompt and timely discharge
in all material respects of the duties of any of directors or officers (or

Parent and Merger Subs obligation to effect the Closing and the Merger and

_Section_ __ _ 7.15_ will not constitute a breach of the condition set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_; and (ii) each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the conditions set forth in

Section 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that:

 

(i) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(c)(ii)_;

 

(ii) if (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(iii)_ or Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(i)_, (B) prior
to the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Company Board, and (C) on
or prior to the date that is 12 months after the date of such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, or submits to the
stockholders of the Company for adoption, an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or consummates any Acquisition Proposal
(in each case, whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same
Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B) above); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(ii)_, all references to 15%
in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced with references
to 50%; or

 



59

    

(iii) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)(ii)_.

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
which amount shall be payable in cash by wire transfer of same-day funds. Any
Termination Fee due under _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(i)_ shall be paid to Parent
within two (2) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement.
Any fee due under _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(ii)_ shall be paid to Parent prior
to or concurrently with the consummation of the transaction referenced in
clause (C) of  _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(ii)_. Any fee due under _Section_ __ _
9.03(a)(iii)_ shall be paid to Parent prior to or concurrently with (and as a
condition to) such termination.

 

(b) The Company agrees that if Parent shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(i)_, the Company shall reimburse Parent
and Merger Sub for all of their Expenses, up to a maximum of $500,000, in the
aggregate (not later than two Business Days after submission by Parent of
statements therefor). In the event Parent becomes entitled to receive a
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_ after the payment to
Parent or Merger Sub of any Expenses under this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_,
the amount of the Termination Fee payable shall be reduced by any Expenses
previously reimbursed pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 

(c) Parent agrees that if the Company shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iii)_,
Parent shall reimburse the Company for all of its Expenses, up to a maximum of
$500,000, in the aggregate (not later than two Business Days after submission
by the Company of statements therefor).

(d) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, including  _Section_
__ _ 7.15_ and this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, all Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction
is consummated, except that the Company and Parent shall each pay one-half of
all Expenses relating to (i) printing, filing and mailing the Proxy Statement
and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with the
Proxy Statement and (ii) any filing fees for filings under applicable foreign,
federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws.

 

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to
pay the Termination Fee or the Company or Parent shall fail to pay any
Expenses when due, the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs
and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent and Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be (including fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this  _Section_ __ _
9.03_, together with interest on such unpaid Termination Fee and Expenses,
commencing on the date that the Termination Fee or such Expenses became due,
at a rate of interest equal to the prime lending rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_
shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred in the event of fraud or
intentional breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
this Agreement is terminated by a party for any reason at a time when the
other party would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, such other
party shall be entitled to receipt of any Expenses or (in the case of

 



60

    

 Parent) Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently
become) payable had such other party terminated this Agreement at such time.
In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee or the
Company or Parent be required to pay any Expenses in connection with the
termination of this Agreement more than once, whether or not the Termination
Fee or any such Expenses may be payable under more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different
events.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, but subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, payment of the fees described
in this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parent and Merger Sub in connection with any termination of this
Agreement in the circumstances in which such fees became payable. In the event
that Parent shall receive the Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company
or any of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives arising out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming
the basis for such termination.

 

Section 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment
may be made that would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration
into which each Share shall be converted upon consummation of the Merger or
that would otherwise require the approval of the stockholders of the Company,
under applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq or
any other relevant stock exchange, without such approval having been
obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the proviso
in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.04_ and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any
condition to its own obligations contained in this Agreement. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of
any other right hereunder.

Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and

or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by _Section_
__ _ 9.03_) to seek (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an

Section 10.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any applicable principles of conflict of laws that would
cause the Laws of another State to otherwise govern this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of
its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be
heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i)
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by either party
hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly effected by
sending notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.02_; (iii) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in

jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune
from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any
of the above named courts; and (iv) agrees not to move to transfer any
such Action to a court other than any of the above-named courts.

Section 10.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 10.11 _Guaranty_.

 

(a) To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Guarantor,
intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due and punctual payment and
performance of (i) Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement,
and (ii) Parents and Merger Subs liability and obligations (including for
breach) under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ").
This guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force
and effect without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor and its
successors and assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied in
full. Guarantor further covenants and agrees that, unless waived by the
Company, it will, not later than five (5) Business Days following the date
hereof, appoint in accordance with applicable Law a registered agent for
service of process in the State of Delaware, and Guarantor shall maintain such
registered agent as its agent for service of process in the State of
Delaware without interruption until the Effective Time.

(b) All payments pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 10.11_ shall be made
in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds.
Guarantor promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and
clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of Guarantor
of any kind.

(c) The guarantee set forth in _ Section_ __ _ 10.11(a)_ (the "
_Guarantee_ ") is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the
full and punctual payment and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Guaranteed Obligations and not of collection. Should Parent or Merger Sub
default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
Guarantors obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to
the Company. Claims hereunder may be made on one or more occasions. If any
payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise
be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder
with respect to such Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been
made.

(d) Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released
or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure
or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to
enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub or any other
Person; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations or rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or
other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement made in accordance with the terms hereof or any agreement
evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release of any
Person

  



65

    

 interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) any
change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger
Sub; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub; (vi) the adequacy of any means the
Company may have of obtaining payment related to the Guaranteed Obligations;
(vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Parent or
Merger Sub may have at any time against the Company (other than rights of
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement), whether in connection with the
Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; or (viii) the existence or release of
any other guaranty or any security interest in any property taken to guaranty
or secure any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligation hereunder.
Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the
Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment,
notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the
Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all
defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium
Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the
marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person interested
in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all suretyship
defenses generally (other than, in each case, fraud, willful misconduct and
intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any of its
Affiliates), defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are
available to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement and defenses available
to Guarantor under the Guarantee. Guarantor acknowledges that it has received
and will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in
this _ Section_ __ _ 10.11_ are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

 

(e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _
10.11_ shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this _
Section_ __ _ 10.11_ preclude any other or future exercise of any right,
remedy or power pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 10.11_. Each and every
right, remedy and power granted to the Company pursuant to this _ Section_
__ _ 10.11_ or allowed it by Law or agreement with respect to this _
Section_ __ _ 10.11_ shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and
may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company
shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against,
exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person liable for any Guaranteed Obligations prior to proceeding
against Guarantor hereunder or resort to any security or other means of
collecting payment. This Guarantee may only be amended by a writing signed and
delivered by Guarantor and the Company.

 

(f) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants and covenants that: (i) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of
Guarantors organizational documents or any Law or contractual restriction
binding on Guarantor or its assets; (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal,

right to indemnification.

 

C. The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, any employee or agent of the Corporation who was

any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit, claim or proceeding
accruing or arising or that, but for this _Article V_ , would accrue or arise,

Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Corporations Bylaws, agreement
or vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

ARTICLE VI

 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court has
no jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware)
shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (B) any action or
proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to
the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (C) any action or
proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL,
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the

2.1 _An_ _nual Meeting_. Meetings of stockholders may be held at
such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting
shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of
remote communication as authorized by _Section_ __ _ 2.13_ of these Amended
and Restated Bylaws (these " _Bylaws_ "). Unless directors are elected by
written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by _Section_ __ _
2.12_ of these Bylaws, an annual meeting of the stockholders for the election
of directors shall be held on a date and at a time as shall be designated by
the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. Any other
proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

 

2.2 _Sp_ _ecial Meeting_ _s_. Unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by
the Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation may be called for any purpose or purposes by the (i) Chief
Executive Officer, if any; (ii) President, in the absence of a Chief Executive
Officer; or (iii) Secretary at the request in writing of (A) a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors or (B) holders of at least twenty
percent (20%) of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of stock of
the Corporation then entitled to vote, and may not be called by the
stockholders absent such a request. Any such request shall state the purpose
or purposes of the proposed meeting.

 

If any person or persons other than the Board calls a special meeting, the
request shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) specify the date and time of such
meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted; and
(iii) be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by facsimile
transmission to the Corporations Chairperson of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer, President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or
Secretary.The officer(s) receiving the request shall cause notice to be
promptly given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and _Section_ __ _
4.2_ of these Bylaws, that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the
person or persons calling the meeting. No business may be transacted at
such special meeting other than business specified in such notice to
stockholders.

   

2.3 _No_ _tice of Stockholders_ __ _Meetings_. All notices of meetings
of stockholders shall be sent, or otherwise given, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_ of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to
vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and
hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.

 

2.4 _Vo_ _ting List_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of
the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. The Corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail
addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane
to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting:
(i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting; or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the Corporations
principal executive office. In the event that the Corporation determines to
make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may
take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of
the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares
held by each of them.

2.5 _Qu_ _orum_. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the
transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairperson of the meeting
or the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present
or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present
or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

 

2.6 _Ad_ _journed Meeting; Notice_. When a meeting is adjourned to another
time or place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be
given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof and the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned
meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the
continuation of the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any
business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If
the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting. 

 



2

    

2.7 _Co_ _nduct of Business_. The chairperson of any meeting of
stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the
meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
business.

 

2.8 _Vo_ _ting_. The stockholders of record on the books of the
Corporation at the close of business on the record date as determined by the
Board of Directors and only such stockholders shall be entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, subject to Section 217
(relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of
stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "). Except as may be
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held
by such stockholder.

 

2.9 _Re_ _cord Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend
or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60)
nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than
sixty (60) days prior to any other such action. If no record date is fixed by
the Board of Directors, then: (i) the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which the meeting is held; (ii) the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is necessary, shall be
the day on which the first written consent is expressed and (iii) the record
date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close
of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating
thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

2.10 _Ac_ _tion at Meetings_. When a quorum is present at any meeting,
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock having voting
power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express
provision of applicable law or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question.

 

2.11 _Pr_ _oxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a
transmission permitted by the DGCL filed in accordance with the procedure
established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. The provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL shall govern
the revocability of any proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable.

 



3

    

2.12 _Ac_ _tion by Stockholders _ _Without_ _a Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required by the DGCL
to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware (by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested), to its principal
place of business, or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of stockholders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation
as provided in Section 228 of the DGCL. In the event that the action which is
consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under
any provision of the DGCL if such action had been voted on by stockholders at
a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such provision shall state, in
lieu of any statement required by such provision concerning any vote of
stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section
228 of the DGCL.

 

A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action
to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or by a person authorized to act
for a stockholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, provided that any such telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the Corporation can determine (i) that the telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder
or by a person authorized to act for the stockholder and (ii) the date on
which such stockholder or authorized person transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the
date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been
delivered until (i) such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such
paper form is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered
office in Delaware (by hand or by certified mail, return receipt requested),
its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
are recorded or (ii) such consent is delivered to the Corporations principal
place of business or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, if
delivered to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board
of Directors.

2.13 _Me_ _eting by Remote Communication_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, as authorized by Section
211(a)(2) of the DGCL the Board may in its sole discretion permit stockholders
to participate in a meeting of stockholders by means of remote communication
and shall be deemed present in person and

 



4

    

 permitted to vote at such meeting, provided that (i) the Corporation shall
implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and
permitted to vote at such meeting by means of remote communication is a
stockholder or proxyholder, (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such meeting and to vote on matters submitted
to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings
of such meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if
such any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at
such meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other
action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

ARTICLE III 

DIRECTORS

 

3.1 _Po_ _wers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors, except as may be
otherwise provided in the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws.

 

3.2 _Nu_ _mber; Election; Tenure and Qualification_. The number of
directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be fixed from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders at an
annual meeting of the stockholders (unless the directors are elected by
written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.12_); _provided_ that the number of directors shall be not less than one
(1). With the exception of the first Board of Directors, which shall be
elected by the incorporator, and except as provided in the Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation or in _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, the directors shall
be elected (i) at the annual meeting of the stockholders by a plurality vote
of the shares represented in person or by proxy or (ii) by written consent of
the Corporations stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, and each
director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and
qualified or until such directors earlier resignation, removal or death.
Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of
Incorporation.

 

3.3 _Va_ _cancies and Newly Created Directorships_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly-created
directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though
less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Each director so chosen
shall serve until his successor is elected and qualified or until such
directors earlier resignation, removal or death. If there are no directors in
office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by
statute.

If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the
Corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any
stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a
stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the
person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders
in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering
an election as provided in Section 211 of the DGCL.

 

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the
directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole
board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of
Chancery may, upon application of any

 



5

    

 stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10%) percent of the total
number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such
directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies
or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the
directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the
provisions of Section 211 of the DGCL as far as applicable. 

3.4 _Lo_ _cation of Meetings; Meetings_ _By_ _Telephone_. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special,
either within or without the State of Delaware. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means
of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which
all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

 

3.5 _Me_ _eting of Newly Elected Board of Directors_. The first meeting of
each newly elected Board of Directors shall be held immediately following the
annual meeting of stockholders and no notice of such meeting shall be
necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the
meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event such meeting is not
held at such time, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be
specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of
the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed
by all of the directors.

3.6 _Re_ _gular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to
time be determined by the Board of Directors; _provided_ that any director who
is absent when such a determination is made shall be given notice of such
location.

3.7 _Sp_ _ecial Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called at any time by a person authorized to call a meeting under this
_Section_ __ _ 3.7_. Special meetings may be called by the (i) Chief
Executive Officer, if any, (ii) President, in the absence of a Chief
Executive Officer, or (iii) Secretary, upon the written request of two
directors unless the Board of Directors consists of only one director, in
which case special meetings may be called by the Secretary upon the written
request of the sole director. Notice may be waived in accordance with Section
229 of the DGCL, or any successor thereto. If the notice is (i) delivered
personally by hand, by courier or by telephone, (ii) sent by facsimile or
(iii) sent by electronic mail, it shall be delivered or sent at least twenty-
four (24) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice
is sent by United States mail, it shall be deposited in the United States mail
at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any
oral notice may be communicated to the director. The notice need not specify
the place of the meeting (if the meeting is to be held at the Corporations
principal executive office) nor the purpose of the meeting.

3.8 _Qu_ _orum and Action at Meetings_. At all meetings of the Board of
Directors, a majority of the total number of duly elected directors then in
office (but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of authorized
directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the
act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a
quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If a
quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum

 



6

    

 shall be present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may
continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if
any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum
for that meeting.

3.9 _Ac_ _tion _ _Without_ _a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board
of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of
the Board of Directors or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the
minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the
minutes are maintained in electronic form.

 

3.10 _Co_ _mmittees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by
a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each
committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The
Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of
any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any
meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a
committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors,
shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation,
but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to (i)
approving, adopting or recommending to the stockholders any action or matter
expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval or
(ii) adopting, amending or repealing any Bylaw of the Corporation. Such
committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined
from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.

 

3.11 _Co_ _mmittee Minutes_. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of

NOTICES 

4.1 _No_ _tice to Directors_. Whenever, under the provisions of the DGCL
or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required
to be given to any director such notice shall be (i) delivered personally by
hand, by courier or by telephone; (ii) sent by United States first-class mail,
postage prepaid; (iii) sent by facsimile; or (iv) sent by electronic mail,
directed to each director at that directors address, telephone number,
facsimile number or electronic mail address, as the case may be, as shown on
the Corporations records.

4.2 _No_ _tice to Stockholders_. Without limiting the manner by which
notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the
DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to
stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked
if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two
consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent
and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person
responsible for the giving of notice; _provided_ , _however_ , the inadvertent
failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any
meeting or other action. Notice given by electronic transmission shall be
deemed given: (a) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number
at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if
by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an
electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such
specific posting, upon the later of (x) such posting and (y) the giving of
such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission,
when directed to the stockholder. As used in these Bylaws, "
_electronic transmission_ " means any form of communication, not directly
involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may
be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be
directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated
process. Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to
Sections 164, 296, 311, 312 or 324 of the DGCL.

4.3 _Af_ _fidavit of Notice_. An affidavit of the secretary or an
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation
that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in
the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

4.4 _Wa_ _iver_ _of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver
by electronic transmission by the person entitled to such notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a
committee of directors need by specified in any written waiver of notice or
any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws.

issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the
Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give the Corporation a

uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall be made to the person
entitled thereto and the transaction shall be recorded upon the books of the
Corporation.

 

6.5 _Re_ _gistered Stockholders_. The Corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the

of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim
to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person,
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a "Proceeding") (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation)
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director of
the Corporation or an officer of the Corporation, or while a

at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection with such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such
persons conduct was unlawful.

Right of the Corporation_. Subject to the other provisions of this _Article

or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer
of the Corporation, or while a director or officer of the Corporation is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 

8.3 _Successful Defense_. To the extent that a present or former director
or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 8.1 or

15

    

 undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay such amounts if it shall
ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified
under this _Article VIII_ or the DGCL. Such expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents
may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation
deems reasonably appropriate and shall be subject to the Corporations
expense guidelines. The right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to
any claim for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these bylaws, but shall
apply to any Proceeding referenced in _Section_ __ _ 8.6(b) or 8.6(c)_ prior
to a determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation.

 

8.6 _Limitation on Indemnification_. Subject to the requirements in
Section 8.3 and the DGCL, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify
any person pursuant to this _Article VIII_ in connection with any Proceeding

person of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act),
if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement
arrangements);

 

(d) initiated by such person against the Corporation or its directors,
officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (i) the board of
directors authorized the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the Proceeding)
prior to its initiation, (ii) the Corporation provides the indemnification, in
its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under
applicable law, (iii) otherwise required to be made under Section 8.7 or (iv)
otherwise required by applicable law; or

 

(e) if prohibited by applicable law; provided, however, that if any
provision or provisions of this _Article VIII_  shall be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this _Article VIII_
(including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph or clause
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,

8.7 _Determination; Claim_. If a claim for indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this _Article VIII_ is not paid in full within 90 days after
receipt by the Corporation of the written request therefor, the claimant shall
be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of his or
her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. The
Corporation shall indemnify such person against any and all expenses that are
incurred by such person in connection with any action for indemnification
or advancement of expenses from the Corporation under this _Article VIII_ ,
to the extent such person is successful in such action, and to the extent not
prohibited by law. In any such suit, the Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving that the claimant is
not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses.

 

8.8 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this _Article VIII_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate
of incorporation or any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office. The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual
contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents
respecting indemnification and advancement of expenses, to the fullest extent
not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law.

8.9 _Insurance._ The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under
the provisions of the DGCL.

8.10 _Survival_. The rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses conferred by this _Article VIII_ shall continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 

8.11 _Effect of Repeal or Modification_. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.

 

8.12 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Article VIII_ ,
references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the
provisions of this _Article VIII_ with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent
corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this
_Article VIII_ , references to "other enterprises" shall include
employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan (excluding any

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended); and references to "serving at the
request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation" as referred to in this _Article VIII_.
