the holders of equity interests in the Company and the assumption of all of
the Company's liabilities, followed by a distribution of such consideration to
the holders of equity interests in the Company in liquidation of the Company
pursuant to Sections 331 and 562 of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Unless otherwise required by a final determination within the

Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part
of any of the Parties or the holders of any interests in the Partnership:

(a)Minority LP Units. Each Minority LP Unit issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, shall be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive an amount equal to the Per Share
Consideration in cash, without interest, and all Minority LP Units that are so
converted as provided in this Section 3.02(a) shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and extinguished automatically and shall cease to
exist.

(b)Partnership Common Units. Each Partnership Common Unit held by the Company
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be unaffected
by the Partnership Merger and shall remain outstanding as Partnership Common
Units of the Partnership held by the Surviving Entity.

(c)General Partnership Interests. The general partnership interest in the
Partnership held by the Company immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Partnership Merger and shall remain
outstanding as a general partnership interest in the Partnership Surviving
Entity held by the Surviving Entity.

3.03. Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) Company Restricted Shares. At the Merger Effective Time, any vesting
conditions applicable to each outstanding award of restricted Company Shares
(a "Company Restricted Share") granted under the Company Stock Plan shall,
automatically and without any action required on the part of the holder
thereof, accelerate in full and each Company Restricted Share shall be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive as of the
Merger Effective Time an amount equal to the Per Share Consideration in cash,
without interest (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such vesting).

(b) Company PSUs. Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, any vesting
conditions applicable to each outstanding award of restricted stock units
subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a "Company PSU") granted
under the Company Stock Plan shall be treated in accordance with the terms set
forth in the applicable award agreement and each Company PSU that is vested as
of the Merger Effective Time (after taking into account any vesting resulting
from the terms of the applicable award agreement, provided, that the
compensation committee of the Company Board may, in its sole discretion, deem
Company PSUs to be earned and vested at maximum levels) (each such earned and
vested Company PSU, an "Earned Company PSU") shall, at the Merger Effective
Time, automatically and without any action required on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Earned
Company PSU an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Consideration (plus any
amount owed with respect to past dividends in accordance with the terms set
forth in the applicable award agreement) for each Earned Company PSU, without
interest (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
vesting or payment). For the avoidance of doubt, each Company PSU that does
not become an Earned Company PSU in accordance with this Section 3.03(b) shall
terminate without consideration immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time.

(c) Payment in Respect of Company Equity Awards. In accordance with Section
3.04(a), at the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, the aggregate amount of cash payable in
respect of the Company Restricted Shares and the Earned Company PSUs pursuant
to Section 3.03(a) and Section 3.03(b), as applicable. Any payment to which a
holder of Company Equity Awards is entitled to pursuant to this Section 3.03
shall be made, without interest, through the Paying Agent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Merger Effective Time (or at such later time
as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse Tax consequences under
Section 409A of the Code). Subject to Section 3.07, the Paying Agent shall pay
with respect to each outstanding award of Company Restricted Shares and Earned
Company PSUs an amount, without interest, determined in accordance with
Sections 3.03(a) and 3.03(b), with such amount to be paid as follows: (1) the
amount in respect of applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
the vesting and payment in respect of each such award of Company Restricted
Shares and Company Earned PSUs, as set forth in a schedule provided by the
Company, shall be paid to the External Manager, subject to the External
Manager agreeing, in writing, that it will remit the amounts set forth in the
applicable schedule to the IRS or other applicable Governmental Authority on
behalf of each of the holders of the Company Restricted Shares and Earned
Company PSUs in a timely manner and (2) the remaining amount payable in
respect of each such award pursuant to Sections 3.03(a) and 3.03(b) to the
holder of the applicable award in the amounts set forth on the schedule
provided by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after the Merger
Effective Time (or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or
adverse Tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code).

(d) Company Actions. At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company and
the Partnership, as applicable, shall take any actions that are necessary to
(1) effectuate the treatment of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to this
Section 3.03 and Section 3.02(a) (with respect to LTIP Units) and (2) cause
the Company Stock Plan and any agreements thereunder to terminate as of the
Merger Effective Time. The Company and the Partnership, as applicable, shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Merger Effective
Time, no holder of a Company Equity Award or any participant in the Company
Stock Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right
thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect of, any equity securities of
the Company, the Partnership, Parent, the Surviving Entity or any subsidiary
thereof, except the right to receive the payments contemplated by this Section
3.03 in the case of Company Restricted Shares and Earned Company PSUs and
Section 3.02(a) in the case of LTIP Units. Prior to the Merger Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver all notices, if required (which notices shall have
been approved by Parent, in its reasonable discretion), to each holder of
Company Restricted Shares, Company PSUs or LTIP Units setting forth each
holder's rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and, as applicable, the
Partnership Agreement, and stating that such Company Restricted Shares,
Company PSUs and LTIP Units shall be treated in the manner set forth in
Section 3.03(a), 3.03(b) or 3.02(a), respectively.

3.04. Surrender of Shares and Units.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Merger Effective Time and the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with a paying agent
(the "Paying Agent") selected by Parent with the Company's prior approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, for
the payment in accordance with this ARTICLE III of the Merger Consideration
and payments to the holders of Minority LP Units. At or prior to the Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with DB, AG
London branch a cash amount in U.S. dollars, Euros and British pounds, that
when taken together with available cash of the Acquired Companies that is
deposited with DB AG, London branch at the Merger Effective Time and the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, is sufficient in the aggregate for the
Paying Agent to make the payments of the Merger Consideration and payments to
holders of Minority LP Units as provided pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section
3.02(a), as applicable (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). The U.S. dollar, Euro and British pound components of the
funds deposited with DB AG, London branch shall be consistent with the
relative portions of the Per Share Consideration that are denominated in U.S.
dollars, Euros and British pounds. In accordance with the hedging agreements
described in Section 3.04 of the Disclosure Letter, the Parties shall cause DB
AG, London branch to convert the Euro and British pound components of the
Exchange Fund into U.S. dollars. Any outstanding hedges relating to the merger
must be unwound prior to the Merger Effective Time and the mark-to-market
present valued and settled net against the U.S. dollars being delivered to the
Exchange Fund. Immediately following such conversion and at or prior to the
Merger Effective Time and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Parties
shall cause DB AG, London branch to deposit the Exchange Fund with the Paying
Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares (other than
Cancelled Shares and Company Restricted Shares) and Minority LP Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time or Partnership
Merger Effective Time, as applicable. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be
invested by the Paying Agent in (1) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America, (2) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (3) short-term commercial paper obligations
rated the highest quality by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively or (4) money market funds investing solely in
a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. Any such investment shall be for the
benefit, and at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income
resulting from such investment shall be for the benefit of Parent and may be
paid to Parent from time to time in Parent's sole discretion. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration and payments to holders of Minority LP Units as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore, or
shall cause to be replaced or restored, the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

(b) Exchange Procedures.

(1) Transmittal Materials. Promptly after the Merger Effective Time and
Partnership Merger Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of record of Company Shares (other
than holders of Cancelled Shares and Company Restricted Shares) or Minority LP
Units immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, as applicable, pursuant
to Section 3.01 and 3.02(a), as applicable: (A) transmittal materials
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon delivery of a Company Share Certificate, or with respect to a
Book-Entry Share, only upon delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book
entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares or, with respect to a Minority LP Unit, a
transfer form (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request in the instructions described in clause (B)),
such transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the delivery of (x) Company Share Certificates or surrender of
the Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the portion of the Merger Consideration
to which such holder of Company Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01 or (y)
Minority LP Units in exchange for the payment to which such Minority LP Unit
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(a).

(2) No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Shares or Minority LP Units.

(a) Each Company Share Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Closing Date to represent only the right to receive (with
respect to each Company Share Certificate, upon delivery thereof, and with
respect to each Book-Entry Share, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agent's message" in customary form) the Per Share Consideration, as
applicable, as contemplated by this ARTICLE III. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable hereunder for any Company Share Certificate or any
Book-Entry Share.

(b) At the Merger Effective Time, holders of Company Shares (that are
converted into the right to receive Per Share Consideration) shall cease to
be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the
right to receive the Per Share Consideration provided under this ARTICLE III.
The Per Share Consideration paid or delivered upon the surrender of Company
Share Certificates representing Company Shares or Book-Entry Shares

this ARTICLE III, shall be deemed to have been paid or delivered, as the case
may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
Company Shares represented thereby or exchanged therefor.

(c) Each Minority LP Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date
to represent only the right to receive (with respect to such Minority LP Unit,
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of a transfer form acceptable to the Paying
Agent) the Per Share Consideration, as contemplated by this ARTICLE III. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable hereunder for any
Minority LP Unit.

(d) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, holders of Minority LP Units
(that are converted into the right to receive Per Share Consideration) shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, limited partners of the Partnership
other than the right to receive the Per Share Consideration provided under
this ARTICLE III. The Per Share Consideration paid or delivered in accordance
with the terms of this ARTICLE III, shall be deemed to have been paid or
delivered, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Minority LP Units represented thereby or
exchanged therefor.

(3) DTC. To the extent applicable, Parent and the Company shall reasonably
cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and with The
Depository Trust Company with respect to shares held of record by The
Depository Trust Company.

(4) Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments.

(a) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, or if payment of any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the delivered Company Share Certificate or the
surrendered Book-Entry Share is registered, upon due delivery of the Company
Share Certificate or due surrender of the Book-Entry Share in accordance with
this ARTICLE III, payment of such portion of the Merger Consideration may be
issued to such transferee or other Person if the Company Share Certificate or
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Company Shares is properly
presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that any applicable transfer or other
similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Minority LP Units that are not
registered in the transfer records of the Partnership, or if payment of any
portion of the payment to be made to the Minority LP Units is to be made to a
Person other than the Person whose name is reflected in the records of the
Partnership, in accordance with this ARTICLE III, payment of such portion of
the amount owed to the holders of Minority LP Units may be issued to such
transferee or other Person if appropriate evidence is properly presented to
the Paying Agent required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that any
applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (A) the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent and
(B) if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such holder of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with regard to such Company
Share Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of
the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 3.04(c), the Surviving Entity) shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the portion
of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

(c) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
unclaimed by the former holders of Company Shares (or the holders of Minority
LP Units) for 18 months after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Entity (or its designee) upon demand. Any such holders of
Company Shares or Minority LP Units prior to the Company Merger or Partnership
Merger, as applicable, who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the portion
of the Merger Consideration or payments to holders of Minority LP Units
payable in respect thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
none of the Surviving Entity, Parent, the Company, the Partnership Surviving
Entity, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Company Shares or Minority LP Units for any amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to
such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all
claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) Transfer Books. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company and the partnership interest records of the
Partnership shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock

the Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as
applicable. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the Company Share
Certificates shall be cancelled, and any Book-Entry Shares, in each case,
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement. If, after the Merger Effective Time, any Company Share Certificate
or evidence of a Book-Entry Share is presented, and acceptable, to the
Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent for transfer, subject to compliance with
the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE III, it shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the portion of the Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) (without interest). The
portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest, paid or delivered upon
the surrender for exchange of Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III, shall be deemed to have been
paid or delivered, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Company Shares represented thereby or exchanged
therefor. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Minority
LP Units outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time shall cease to have rights, except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement. If, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, any Minority LP
Unit is presented, and acceptable, to the Partnership Surviving Entity or the
Paying Agent for transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth
in this ARTICLE III, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
3.02(a) (without interest). The Per Share Consideration, without interest,
paid or delivered upon the surrender for exchange of a Minority LP Unit in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III, shall be deemed to have been
paid or delivered, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to such Minority LP Unit.

or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Company Merger or
other transactions contemplated hereby.

but prior to the Merger Effective Time, the number of outstanding Company
Shares or Partnership Common Units issued and outstanding shall, through a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the capitalization of
the Company or the Partnership, as applicable, increase or decrease in number
or be changed into or exchanged for a different kind or number of securities,
then the Per Share Consideration, shall be equitably adjusted to provide to
Parent and the holders of Company Shares and Partnership Common Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided, that nothing in this Section 3.06 shall be construed to permit any
of the Acquired Companies or any other Person to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

3.07. Withholding. All amounts payable pursuant to this ARTICLE III shall be
paid without interest (unless otherwise noted). Each of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Partnership, the Partnership Surviving
Entity, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amount as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Partnership, the
Partnership Surviving Entity, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under applicable Law (including, but not limited to, Section
1445 of the Code), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld by the applicable payor in respect of any Person and
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. Each
of the Company Subsidiaries has the corporate (or comparable) power and
authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own or

of Merger Sub are owned directly or indirectly by Parent or a Subsidiary

similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights or by general equity principles).

with, any Governmental Authority or with any third party are required to be
made or obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this

(2) Subject to receipt of the consents and approvals referred to in the
preceding paragraph, and the expiration of related waiting periods, and
assuming the required filings and registrations referred to in the preceding
paragraph have been made, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (A) constitute a violation by Parent
or Merger Sub of any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, or (B) constitute
a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Constituent Documents of
Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of clauses (A) or (B), for any such

applicable.

(f) Compliance with Laws. Each of Parent and Merger Sub:

(1) has conducted its business in compliance with all applicable Laws, except
for violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub; and

(2) (A) has not received, since January 1, 2017, any written notification from
any Governmental Authority (i) of any violation by Parent or Merger Sub of any
Law, which notification remains outstanding or unresolved as of the date
hereof, or (ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or
governmental authorization, or (B) has not provided, since January 1, 2017,
any written notification to any Governmental Authority regarding any violation
by Parent or Merger Sub of any Law, which notification remains outstanding or

of 2010, or any other applicable laws or regulations relating to bribery or

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub; and

Country or (B) any Sanctioned Person, to the extent in violation of Sanctions,

(g) Merger Consideration. Parent has received and accepted, and has delivered
to the Company, a true, correct and complete fully executed copy of the Equity
Commitment Letter from the Sponsor to invest, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being
referred to as the "Equity Financing"). As of the date hereof, the Equity
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and the other parties
thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally. The Equity Commitment Letter has not
been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect, no amendment,
supplement or modification is contemplated and the commitments thereunder have
not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. No event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent, or any other parties thereto under any term or condition of the Equity
Commitment Letter. Taking into account the cash forecast contained in the
Company's Operating Budget, the Equity Financing, when funded in accordance
with the Equity Commitment Letter, taken together with cash on hand of the
Company, will provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date,
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of
the Merger Consideration, any payments to holders of Minority LP Units
required to be made in connection with the Mergers, any fees and expenses of
or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity, any payments in
respect of the Company Equity Awards required to be made in connection with
the Mergers, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness
of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries required in
connection therewith. Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy any term or condition of closing set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter at or prior to Closing, or that any portion of the Equity Financing to
be made thereunder will otherwise not be available to Parent to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the time
required pursuant to this Agreement. The obligations to make the Equity
Financing available to Parent pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter are not subject to any conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than
as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether
oral or written) or commitments to enter into agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) to which Parent is a party related to
the Equity Financing other than as expressly contained in the Equity
Commitment Letter and delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement
for Parent to obtain the Equity Financing or any other financing.

(h) Financial Advisors. Neither Parent or Merger Sub has employed any broker
or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except

Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in

Units or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Company Shares or Partnership Common Units, or holds any
rights to acquire or vote any Company Shares or Partnership Common Units
(other than pursuant to this Agreement). None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or, to Parent's Knowledge, the
Representatives of such Person, within the past five years, has been an
"interested stockholder" of the Company, in each case, as defined in Section
3-601 of the MGCL.

(j) Certain Arrangements. As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective controlled Affiliates has entered into any Contract,
commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or
undertaking, whether written or oral, with any director, officer, employee or

Agreement or the operations of the Surviving Entity after the Merger Effective
Time.

(k) Solvency. As of the Merger Effective Time, assuming the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.03 and after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including

a whole, will be Solvent and Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.02(k), the term "Solvent"
means, with respect to any Person as of a particular date, that on such date,
(i) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of such Person exceeds its
debts, (ii) such Person has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as such debts mature and (iii) such Person does not have unreasonably
small capital with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this Section
4.02(k), "debt" means any liability whether or not reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. For purposes of this
Section 4.02(k), the amount of any unliquidated or contingent liabilities at
any time shall be the maximum amount which, in light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, would reasonably be expected to become an
actual or matured liability.

looking information with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent
and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts,
business plans and other forward-looking information furnished to them
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information),
and that Parent and Merger Sub shall have no claim against the Company, the
Partnership or Partnership Merger Sub or any of the Company's stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other
Representatives with respect thereto, except in the case of fraud.

best efforts to cause its or their agents, advisors and Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or

such that the Person does not become an "interested stockholder" for purposes
of the MGCL), (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than, in response to an

Acquisition Proposal and the Person that made it and to refer the inquiring
Person to this Section 6.01), (iii) provide (including through access to any
data room) any non-public information relating to the Acquired Companies to

expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any agreement,

an Acquisition Proposal, (vi) terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any
provision of, grant permission under, or take any other action having a

(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.01, prior to
the time that the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, but not after, the
Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a
Person or Persons who have made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a solicitation made in breach of this Agreement if, prior
to providing any non-public information regarding the Company, the Company
receives from such Person or Persons an executed confidentiality agreement,
and as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information
to Parent to the extent not previously provided to Parent or (B) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that,
prior to taking any action described in clause (A) or (B) above, the SRC (x)
determines in good faith based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (y) determines in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel that failure to take such action would likely be inconsistent
with each director's duties under applicable Law. Promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) after providing any non-public information to
such Person, the Company shall make such non-public information available to
Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made
available to Parent).

(b) No Change of Recommendation. Neither the Company Board, nor any committee
thereof, including the SRC, shall:

(1) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Recommendation or any other approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board or SRC with respect to this
Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(B) approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal, (C) submit any Acquisition Proposal or any matter related thereto to
the vote of the stockholders of the Company, (D) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (E) if any Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acquisition Proposal in the circumstances described in clause "(F)"
below) has been made public, fail to publicly affirm or reaffirm the Company
Recommendation upon request of Parent within five (5) Business Days after the
date an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced (or if the
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within five (5) Business Days
from the date an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, promptly and in
any event prior to the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to
be held); provided, that Parent may make any such request only once with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently materially modified in which case Parent may make such request
once each time such material modification is made is; (F) fail to publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Company's stockholders) within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer; and (G)
publicly propose or publicly announce an intention to take any of the
foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a "Change of Recommendation"); or

(2) except as permitted by Section 6.01(c), approve, adopt, declare advisable
or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend), or cause or permit any of the Acquired Companies to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or otherwise resolve to do
so.

(c) Alternative Acquisition Agreement; Intervening Event.

(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.01,
if (A) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
a Person or Persons that did not result from a solicitation made in breach of
this Agreement, (B) the SRC determines in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its financial advisors that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the SRC determines
in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure
to make a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal (absent revision of the terms of this Agreement as contemplated in
this Section 6.01(c)(1)) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
each director's duties under applicable Law, and (D) such Acquisition Proposal
is not withdrawn and the Company is not in material breach of this Section
6.01, then, prior to the time (but not after) the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company Board, the SRC and/or the Company, as applicable, may
take the following actions: (x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y)
terminate, and cause or permit the Company to terminate, this Agreement to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) will be void and of no force or effect, unless and
until the Company complies with the requirements of Section 8.03(b) and pays
the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.05(c); and provided, further,
that the Company Board and the SRC may not effect a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) and the Company may not, and the Company
Board and the SRC may not permit or cause the Company to, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four (4) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of the SRC and/or the
Company Board's intention to make a Change of Recommendation and/or authorize
the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
will not, by itself, constitute a Change of Recommendation), which notice will
specify the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and the Company shall
have contemporaneously provided a copy of the then-latest drafts of all
definitive transaction agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
price or other material terms of the Superior Proposal, the Company will be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.01(c)(1) with respect to such new written
notice; provided, that references to the four (4) Business Day period above
shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period; and

(iii) Parent shall not have, within the Notice Period, proposed in writing to
modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that the SRC and
the Company Board have in good faith determined (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors) would result in the
Acquisition Proposal ceasing to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
time (but not after) the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, solely in
response to an Intervening Event, the SRC and the Company Board may make a
Change of Recommendation if the SRC determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to make a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with each director's duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the
SRC and the Company Board may not make a Change of Recommendation pursuant to
the foregoing unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four (4) Business Days in advance (the "Intervening Event Notice Period"), of
the SRC and/or the Company Board's intention to make a Change of
Recommendation (it being understood that the delivery of such notice and any
amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice,
update or amendment shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of
Recommendation), which notice shall specify in detail the SRC and/or the
Company Board's reason for proposing to make such Change of Recommendation
(including a description of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail);

(ii) the Company shall, and shall have caused the Company's Representatives
to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate
the need for the SRC and the Company Board to make such Change of
Recommendation; and

(iii) Parent shall not have, within the Intervening Event Notice Period,
proposed in writing to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a
manner that the SRC and the Company Board has in good faith determined (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) would obviate the need for the
SRC and the Company Board to make such Change of Recommendation.

(d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company, the SRC or the Company Board from complying with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be made
in compliance with this Section 6.01.

(e) Limits on Release of Standstill. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to waive or fail
to enforce any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
obligation of any Person to allow the counterparty thereof to make a private
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board in accordance with this Agreement if
the SRC determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action (or taking action) would likely be
inconsistent with each director's duties under applicable Law; provided, that
the Company promptly advises Parent that it is taking such action or its
failure to take action and the identity of the party or parties with respect
to which it is taking such action or it failed to take action; provided,
further, that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a
Person to orally request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation to
the extent necessary to comply with fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Notice. The Company agrees that it shall (1) promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing if any Acquisition
Proposal is received by, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to
be initiated regarding an Acquisition Proposal with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements), (2) promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company
provides non-public information to any Person in accordance with this Section
6.01 and (3) keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the
status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments
thereto), including by providing a copy of all written proposals, offers or
drafts of proposed agreements, and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

6.02. Proxy Statement.

cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and file with the SEC all other

other transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

to the contrary, prior to the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement (or

Company stockholders, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and to comment on such document or response, which the
Company shall consider in good faith and include in such filing, document or
response any reasonable comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its
Representatives. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company
the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall provide Parent with copies of (1) all material correspondence between it
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the
other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement and (2) all written comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and furnish the information required
to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, and respond to and resolve
any comments made by the SEC as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof.
The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders
of Company Shares as of the record date established for the Stockholders
Meeting promptly (but in any event no more than five (5) Business Days after
the earlier of (1) receiving notification that the SEC is not reviewing the
preliminary Proxy Statement and (2) date on which the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the preliminary Proxy Statement).

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, is discovered
by a Party, which information should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Party, and the Company shall prepare (with the
assistance of Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (1) correct any
information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect and (2) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or
supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its
stockholders of record as of the record date established for the Stockholders
Meeting, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable Law.

6.03. Stockholders Meeting. Subject to the duties of each of the Company's
directors under applicable Law, the Company, acting through the Company Board
(or a committee thereof), shall, as promptly as practicable following

Documents and the applicable requirements of the NYSE necessary to promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the

written consent of Parent, (c) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies to the extent the Company reasonably believes necessary in
order to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or (d) in the absence of a quorum;
provided, that in the case of clause (c) or (d), without the written consent
of Parent, in no event shall the Stockholders Meeting (as so postponed or
adjourned) be held on a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date
for which the Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled. Unless the
Company Board or any committee thereof has withdrawn the Company
Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.01, the Company, through the
Company Board, shall recommend to holders of the Company Shares that they vote
in favor of the Company Merger and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit the Requisite Company Vote (including by
soliciting proxies from the Company's stockholders). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent. Unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with ARTICLE VIII, (x) the Company shall not submit to the vote of
its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal and (y) the obligation of the
Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders
Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto
that may be required by Law) to the Company's stockholders shall not be
affected by a Change of Recommendation.

6.04. Actions.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all

the transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall cooperate fully with, and
furnish information to, the other Party to those ends.

Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to

Governmental Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees that it shall consult with
the other Party with respect to obtaining all material permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable in connection with the authorization, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party shall keep the other Party
appraised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish the other Party with
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and its

application made by or on behalf of such other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates with or to any third party or Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested from an antitrust authority in the
Relevant Jurisdiction and to take any and all other actions reasonably

Company Subsidiaries and their Affiliates shall, and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the External Manager to, cooperate with

Subsidiary due to be filed after the Closing related to any taxable period.

shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release, written and broadly disseminated communication or other
written stockholder communication with respect to the Mergers or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such stockholder communication or make any
such public statement with respect to the Mergers or this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, that a Party may,
without the prior consent of the other Party (but after prior consultation, to
the extent practicable in the circumstances and permitted by applicable law),
issue such communication or make such public statement as may be required by
applicable Law or securities exchange rules in furtherance of the foregoing.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate to develop all public communications
and make appropriate members of management available at presentations related
to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other
Party; provided, further, that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in Section 6.01, Parent's consent shall not be required, and the Company shall
not be required to consult with Parent in connection with, or provide Parent
an opportunity to review or comment upon, any press release or other public
statement or comment to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or with respect to any actions contemplated by Section 6.01(b) or
Section 6.01(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may, without the
prior consent of the other Party, reasonably disseminate information
previously included in a press release or other public disclosure made
pursuant to this Section 6.05.

6.06. Access; Information.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Merger Effective Time or the termination of the Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, upon reasonable advance notice, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, (1) provide to Parent and its
Representatives access during normal business hours of the Company and/or the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon prior written notice, to the
officers, employees, properties (subject to the terms of the relevant leases),
books and records (including Tax Returns and information relating to Taxes) of
the Acquired Companies (other than any of the foregoing that relate to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the process that led to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or, subject to the disclosure
requirements set forth in Section 6.01, to any Acquisition Proposal) and (2)
furnish promptly such information concerning officers, employees, properties,
books and records (including Tax Returns and information relating to Taxes) of
the Acquired Companies as Parent may reasonably request; provided, that any
such access shall be conducted at Parent's expense, at a reasonable time,
under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company or its
Representatives or applicable Company Subsidiaries and in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the normal business or operations of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall require the
Acquired Companies to disclose any information to the extent such disclosure
(A) would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or (B) would reasonably
be expected to violate any applicable Law or any written agreement,
undertaking, lease, license, Contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement
or other written obligations or fiduciary duties of such Party; provided,
further, that information shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint
defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external
counsel for Parent, to the extent that the Company determines in consultation
with its outside legal counsel that doing so is reasonably expected to be
required for the purpose of complying with applicable Laws or preparing any
filing or submission with a Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation, litigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any proceeding initiated by a private Person).

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the information disclosed under this
Section 6.06 and otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, with such obligations
thereunder being deemed to survive until the Merger Effective Time.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, rights to conduct or cause to be conducted any
environmental investigation of the current or former operations or facilities
of the Acquired Companies without the prior written consent of the Company in
its sole discretion.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the External Manager and each Affiliate of the External Manager to
deliver to the Company all Contracts and records in the External Manager's or
any of its Affiliates' possession or control to the extent (with respect to
Contracts) they are Contracts to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party, and with respect to records, to the extent they
pertain to the business of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, such records shall not include
records that are the owned property of the External Manager and are not owned
property of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

6.07. Takeover Laws. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Laws to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Mergers or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If any Takeover
Laws is or may become applicable to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the members of the Company
Board shall grant such approvals and shall use reasonable best efforts to take
such actions so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall be construed to permit Parent
or Merger Sub to do any act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or
as a waiver of any of the Company's rights under, any other provision of this
Agreement.

6.08. Management Agreement and Employee Matters.

(a) Prior to the date hereof, the Company and the External Manager entered
into an amendment to the Management Agreement providing for the termination of
the Management Agreement effective upon Merger Effective Time, and such
termination shall be without any liability to any of the Acquired Companies,
Parent, any Affiliate of Parent or the Surviving Entity. Immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the External Manager
all amounts owed to the External Manager under the Management Agreement, as
set forth in Section 6.08(a) of the Disclosure Letter. Effective as of the
Merger Effective Time, the Company shall cause the External Manager and its
Affiliates to fully and unconditionally release any claims or liabilities
whatsoever that they may have against any of the Acquired Companies, Parent,
any Affiliate of Parent, or the Surviving Entity under the Management
Agreement, except with respect to those rights which, pursuant to the express
terms of the Management Agreement, survive the termination of the Management
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the Management Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company pay the External Manager any amounts
in excess of the amounts set forth in Section 6.08(a) of the Disclosure
Letter. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.08(a) or the Management
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that the rights of the External
Manager under Section 8 of the Management Agreement shall survive termination
of the Management Agreement.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Plan, (2) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their
compensation or benefit plans, or (3) create a right in any employee of the
External Manager or any of its Affiliates to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates.

6.09. Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the
Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries to, also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; provided, that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present
and former director and officer of the Acquired Companies (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of six years from and after
the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall not, and Parent shall
not permit the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any provision of the Constituent Documents of the
Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the exculpation or
indemnification (including advancement of expenses) of any Indemnified Parties
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnified Party, it being the intent of the Parties that the Indemnified
Parties shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification
(including advancement of expenses) to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law as provided in Section 6.09(a). Parent and the Surviving Entity
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, honor and
perform under all indemnification and expense advancement obligations owed to
any of the Indemnified Parties.

(c) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Merger
Effective Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from and after the Merger Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO
Insurance") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Merger Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company
and the Surviving Entity for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, continue to maintain in effect for
a period of at least six years from and after the Merger Effective Time the
DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Entity shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (2) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the
Surviving Entity or any of the Surviving Entity's successors or assigns
undertakes any complete or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Entity will cause proper
provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.09.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.09 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, his or her heirs
and his or her Representatives. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Entity under this Section 6.09 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any
Indemnified Parties unless (1) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (2) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in
writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section
6.09.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.09 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Constituent
Documents of the Acquired Companies, or under any applicable Contracts or
Laws. Further, nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.09, is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Acquired Companies or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 6.09 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies.

6.10. Notification of Certain Matters. Parent and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that
(a) would reasonably be expected, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or the Company, as applicable, or (b)
would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition in ARTICLE VII.

6.11. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause any dispositions of any securities of the Company or the
Partnership (including derivative securities) by each Person who is or will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.

6.12. REIT Opinion Officer's Certificate. The Company shall deliver to Vinson
and Elkins L.L.P. (or other counsel to the Company) the officer's certificate
described in Section 7.03(e) in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, with
such factual updates as appropriate, provided that Parent is given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such updates and finds them reasonably
acceptable.

Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. (or other counsel to the Company) the representation
letter described in Section 7.03(f) in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto.

6.14. Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

6.15. Dividends. From the date hereof and through the Merger Effective Time,
the Company may make (and shall make) distributions, including under Section
857, 858 or 860 of the Code, necessary for the Company to (a) maintain its
status as a REIT under the Code or (b) avoid or reduce the imposition of any
entity level income or excise Tax under the Code (and any corresponding
dividend or distribution in respect of Partnership Common Units or LTIP
Units). If the Company declares, sets aside or makes or pays any cash
dividends or distributions on the Company Shares (whether to maintain the
Company's qualification as a REIT under the Code or otherwise), the Per Share
Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the per share amount of
such dividend or distribution; provided, that any dividends or distributions
made in accordance with Sections 5.01(c)(1)(A), (B), (C) or (D) shall not
result in any such adjustment. In the event that a distribution with respect
to the Company Shares permitted under the terms of this Agreement has a record
date prior to the Merger Effective Time and has not been paid prior to the
Closing Date, such distribution shall be paid to the holders of such Company
Shares as of such record date immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time.

6.16. Stock Exchange Delisting. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper, or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of NYSE to enable the delisting by the Company of the
Company Shares from NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective
Time and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after such delisting.

6.17. Transaction Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Merger Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, (a) the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after obtaining Knowledge
that any such Transaction Litigation is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted), notify Parent in writing of any such Transaction Litigation, (b)
Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate and consult each other in
good faith on any material decisions in the defense and settlement of any
Transaction Litigation (including any class action or derivative litigation),

status of any such Transaction Litigation and shall give reasonable
consideration to Parent's advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation,
and (d) the Company shall give Parent and its Representatives a reasonable
opportunity to review, as practicable, material filings or responses to be
given to any third party or Governmental Authority in connection therewith;
provided, that no compromise, settlement, arrangement regarding or agreement
to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction
Litigation shall be made without the prior written consent of the other Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.18. Debt Financing and Cooperation.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, upon the request of the Company, Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (as defined below). Parent acknowledges
and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to
Closing and that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of
the obtaining of (or the failure to obtain) the Debt Financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, to Parent
and Merger Sub, in each case at Parent's sole expense, all cooperation
reasonably necessary and customary in connection with the arrangement of debt
financing with respect to the Acquired Companies or the Company Property
(collectively, the "Debt Financing"), reasonably requested in writing by
Parent, including using commercially reasonable efforts to:

(1) upon reasonable notice, the Company shall direct management of the
Acquired Companies (including employees of the External Manager) with
appropriate seniority and expertise to participate in a reasonable number of
meetings and presentations with prospective lenders at reasonable times and
locations mutually agreed;

(2) assist with the preparation of materials for bank information memoranda
and similar documents reasonably necessary in connection with the Debt
Financing and provide reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of
any source of any Debt Financing to the extent reasonable and customary; in
each case in this clause: (A) subject to customary confidentiality provisions
and disclaimers, (B) as reasonably requested by Parent and (C) limited to
information to be contained therein with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries;

(3) furnish Parent and its potential debt financing sources for the Debt
Financing (the "Lenders") reasonably promptly upon written request with such
financial, statistical and other pertinent information and projections
relating to the Acquired Companies as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
as is usual and customary for Debt Financings and reasonably available and
prepared by or for the Acquired Companies in the ordinary course of business;

(4) assist with the preparation of customary definitive loan documentation
contemplated by the Debt Financing (including schedules), including any
customary guarantee, pledge and security documents;

(5) provide to Parent upon written request all documentation and other
information with respect to the Acquired Companies reasonably requested by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act in connection with
the Debt Financing, that has in each case been requested in writing at least
fourteen (14) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

(6) cooperate in connection with the repayment or defeasance of any existing
Indebtedness of the Company or any Acquired Companies as of, and subject to
occurrence of, the Closing and the release of related Liens following the
repayment in full of such Indebtedness, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver such customary payoff, defeasance or similar
notices under any existing loans of the Company or any of Acquired Companies
as are reasonably requested by Parent (provided, that the Company and the
Acquired Companies shall not be required to deliver any notices that are not
conditioned on, and subject to the occurrence of, the Closing); and

(7) cooperate with obtaining customary title insurance with respect to each
material Company Property as requested by Parent.

The Company shall have satisfied its obligations set forth in Sections 6.18(b)
if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with such obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are actually
obtained or provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to provide, or cause its Subsidiaries or Representatives to provide,
cooperation under this Section 6.18 to the extent that it: (A) unreasonably
interferes with the ongoing business of the Acquired Companies; (B) requires
the Acquired Companies to incur any Liability (including, without limitation,
any commitment fees and expense reimbursement) in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing; (C) requires the Acquired Companies or their
respective directors, trustees, officers, managers or employees to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document, certificate or
instrument with respect to the Debt Financing (other than with respect to
customary authorization letters with respect to bank information memoranda) or
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Debt Financing is obtained; (D) requires the Acquired Companies
or their counsel to give any legal opinion; (E) requires the Acquired
Companies to provide any information that is prohibited or restricted by
applicable Law; (F) provide access to or disclose information that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries determines would reasonably be expected to result
in a loss or waiver of or jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product or other legal privilege (provided, that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in the events set out in this clause (F)); (G)
requires the Acquired Companies to take any action that is prohibited or
restricted by, or would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate,
its organizational documents, or would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract to which any
of the Acquired Companies is a party or any applicable Laws; (H) would
reasonably be expected to result in any officer or director of the Acquired
Companies incurring personal liability with respect to any matter relating to
the Debt Financing or requires any officer, director or other Representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate that such
officer, director or other Representative reasonably believes, in good faith,
contains any untrue certifications; (I) requires the Acquired Companies or
their Representatives, as applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement; or (J) such cooperation causes any representation, warranty,
covenant or other term in this Agreement to be breached or causes any Closing
condition set forth in Article VII to fail to be satisfied. In no event shall
the Company be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver
any financial or other information that is not currently readily available to
the Acquired Companies (other than information which an Acquired Company is
entitled to receive and actually receives following request pursuant to
Management Agreement Documents) on the date hereof or is not otherwise
prepared in the ordinary course of business of Acquired Companies at the time
requested by Parent or for the failure to obtain review of any financial or
other information by its accountants. In no event shall the Acquired Companies
be required to pay any commitment or other fee or give an indemnity or incur
any Liability (including due to any act or omission by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives) or
expense (including legal and accounting expenses) in connection with assisting
Parent and Merger Sub in arranging the Debt Financing or as a result of any
information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the Debt
Financing. None of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company
set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or
violated by, any of the actions taken by the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives at the request of
Parent pursuant to Section 6.18. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section
6.18(b) represent the sole obligation of the Acquired Companies and their
respective Affiliates with respect to cooperation in connection with the Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition precedent
set forth in Section 7.03(b), as it applies to the Company's obligations under
Section 6.18, shall be deemed satisfied, unless the Company has materially and
willfully breached its obligations under Section 6.18, Parent has provided to
the Company written notice of such breach within ten (10) Business Days of
first becoming aware of such breach and the Company fails to cure such breach
by ten (10) Business Days after such notice is provided.

(c) Parent shall reimburse the Acquired Companies promptly upon demand for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
and accountants' fees) incurred by the Acquired Companies and its
Representatives in connection with the cooperation under Section 6.18, any
action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.18
(including the dissolution and termination of any subsidiaries formed and
documentation entered into pursuant to Section 6.18), and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Acquired Companies and their Representatives and each of the
Acquired Companies' and their Representatives' respective present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Financing
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs,
expenses, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements, awards and Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing and any
information used in connection therewith. The provisions of this Section
6.18(c) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the foregoing Indemnified Parties. This Section 6.18(c) shall survive
the termination of this Agreement (and in the event the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation under this
Section 6.18 and not previously reimbursed).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement,
Parent and its Representatives may not initiate contact with or pursue
potential Lenders in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without (1) the prior written consent of the
Company and (2) the execution of an agreement binding the potential Lender to
the same confidentiality, use restrictions and other terms set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior
written consent of the Company, in no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to include
each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or any other understanding, whether written or oral, with any
potential debt financing source or sources that would reasonably be expected
to limit, restrict, restrain, otherwise impair in any manner, directly or
indirectly, the ability of such debt financing source or sources (including
any Lender) to provide debt financing or other assistance to any other party
in any other transaction involving the Acquired Company (provided that the
foregoing shall not prohibit the establishment of customary "tree"
arrangements).

6.19. Assumed Indebtedness.

(a) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has received all of the consents,
approvals and waivers, as applicable, relating to the Indebtedness of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries set forth on Section 4.01(b)(6) of the
Disclosure Letter (the "Assumed Indebtedness"), as are required under the
terms of the Assumed Indebtedness to permit the consummation of the Mergers
and such Assumed Indebtedness to be assumed by Parent or its designated
Affiliate (including the change in control of the applicable Company
Subsidiary) at the Merger Effective Time on substantially the same terms and
conditions as currently in effect (subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in such consents, approvals and waivers, as applicable, including, but
not limited to, the execution and delivery of required documentation, the
payment of any required fees, costs and expenses and the completion by the
lenders of client identification procedures in compliance with applicable
money laundering rules (including know your customer procedures (KYC)) (such
consents, approvals and waivers, collectively, the "Required Indebtedness
Consents"). Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any
Indebtedness that Parent intends not to repay or not to cause the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to repay at the Closing, the Company and each
of the Company Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, at
Parent's sole cost and expense, in connection with maintaining such continuing
Indebtedness. In furtherance of the foregoing, at the option of Parent, Parent
shall have the right to discuss with any such lender maintaining the
Indebtedness (provided that the Company is provided a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the discussions and Parent shall provide the Company with
updates on the status of discussions upon the Company's reasonable request)
and make all determinations and decisions regarding such Indebtedness from and
after the Closing and any payment of costs or fees relating thereto from or
after the Closing. The Company's obligations pursuant to this Section 6.19
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.18.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees, at Parent's sole cost and
expense, to cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
implement such arrangements as may be requested by Parent with respect to the
defeasance of any Indebtedness in connection with the Closing, including,
without limitation, executing and delivering such documents, instruments and
other arrangements as may be reasonably required in connection therewith.

6.20. 2019 Dispositions. The Company shall conduct any direct or indirect
asset dispositions for its 2019 taxable year, including those asset
dispositions deemed to occur as a result of the Mergers, to fall within the
"safe harbor" of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code.

6.21. Liquidation of Qualified REIT Subsidiaries and Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries. All U.S. Subsidiaries that are taxable as a Qualified REIT
Subsidiary or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary shall be liquidated under Section 332
of the Code no later than immediately prior to the Closing.

6.22. Environmental Reports. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange to deliver to Parent, at Parent's sole cost and expense,
reliance letters in favor of Parent from Arcadis Consulting (UK) Limited
("Arcadis") in respect of the reports set forth in Section 6.22 of the
Disclosure Letter in a form to be agreed by the Company and Parent (both
acting reasonably). Parent shall bear the cost of any incremental premiums
imposed by Arcadis arising from changes to Arcadis' standard form reliance
letter.

6.23. French 3% Annual Tax Returns. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent (1) written evidence that all
French 3% annual tax returns ("3% Annual Tax Returns") required to be filed in
relation to the Issy-Les-Moulineaux Property and the MacDonald Property have
been validly filed with the French tax authority and (2) written confirmation
that a copy of all 3% Annual Tax Returns filed in relation to the properties
known as the Issy-Les-Moulineaux Property, the MacDonald Property, the Marceau
Property and the Joubert Property will be held in escrow by Clifford Chance
LLP for the benefit of Parent upon Closing and until January 21, 2026;
provided; however, in the event a procedure or enquiry made by the French tax
authority is still be pending on January 21, 2026, the escrow period shall be
extended to the final closing date of any such procedure or enquiry.

Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. ("REIT Status Opinion") (or other counsel to Company
reasonably acceptable to Parent), dated as of the Closing Date and
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A, to the effect that,
commencing with the Company's initial taxable year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and its
actual method of operation has enabled the Company to meet, through the Merger
Effective Time, the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code. Such REIT Status Opinion will be based on customary
representations contained in an officer's certificate executed by the Company
in the form attached as Exhibit A, dated as of the Closing Date. Such
officer's certificates shall be in executed form, and attached to the REIT
Status Opinion.

(f) Dealer Property Opinion. The parties acknowledge that the Company received
a written opinion from Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. dated March 13, 2017 with
respect to certain dispositions and their treatment under Section 857(b)(6)(A)
of the Code (the "2017 Dealer Property Opinion"), the executed version of
which is attached as Exhibit B. For purposes of this Section 7.03(f), Parent
shall have received a written and executed update to the 2017 Dealer Property
Opinion from Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. (the "Dealer Property Opinion") (or other
counsel to Company reasonably acceptable to Parent), dated as of the Closing
Date and substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C, concluding (A) with
regard to property sales through the end of 2017 and including an analysis as
to whether any direct or indirect property disposition by the Company
subsequent to 2017, including, but not limited to, any property deemed sold as
part of the Mergers, should not cause any property sold by the Company in
2015-2017 to be Dealer Property (as defined in the 2017 Dealer Property
Opinion) for purposes of the Tax on prohibited transactions provided for in
Section 857(b)(6)(A) of the Code, and (B) that the Company is within the
Section 857(b)(6)(C) "safe harbor" with respect to taxable years 2018 and 2019
after giving effect to the Mergers. Such Dealer Property Opinion will be
based a representation letter executed by the Company in the form attached as
Exhibit C, dated as of the Closing Date. Such representation letter shall be
in executed form, and attached to the Dealer Property Opinion.

7.04. Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent or Merger Sub, on the
one hand, nor the Company, the Partnership or Partnership Merger Sub, on the
other hand, may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section
7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied (or to be able to be
satisfied) to excuse it from its obligation to effect the Mergers if such
failure (or inability to be satisfied) was caused by such party's failure to
comply with or perform its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION

8.01. Termination by Mutual Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated, and
the Mergers may be abandoned, at any time before the Partnership Merger
Effective Time by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written
instrument.

8.02. Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be
terminated, and the Mergers may be abandoned, at any time before the
Partnership Merger Effective Time by either Parent or the Company, upon prior
written notice to the other Party, whether before or after the Requisite
Company Vote has been obtained except as otherwise expressly noted (with any
termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

(a) Delay. If the Merger Effective Time has not occurred by the close of
business on December 15, 2019 (the "Initial Outside Date"); provided, however,
that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.08, if prior
to the Initial Outside Date, any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Section 7.01(a), Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) (but only to the extent
the applicable Order relates to the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Section 7.01(b)) have not been satisfied (or waived) but all other conditions
to the Closing (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived) or are capable of
being satisfied by the Initial Outside Date, the Initial Outside Date may be
extended by the Company or Parent to March 1, 2020 (the "Outside Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.02(a) shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the Merger
Effective Time to occur on or before such date was primarily caused by a
material breach by such Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement of such Party set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Failure to Obtain Requisite Company Vote. If the Requisite Company Vote
shall not have been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting duly convened
therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case, at which
a vote on the approval of the Company Merger was taken.

(c) Denial of Regulatory Approval; Injunction. If (1) any Requisite Regulatory
Approval is denied by final, non-appealable action or (2) any Governmental
Authority shall have issued any Order permanently enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Mergers and such Order remains in effect and shall have
become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to have
such Order lifted if and to the extent required by Section 6.04.

8.03. Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company, upon prior written notice to Parent, and the Mergers may be abandoned
at any time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, whether before or
after the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained except as otherwise
expressly noted if:

(a) Parent or Merger Sub has breached any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) would not be satisfied and
such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within
the earlier of (1) 45 days after written notice thereof is given by the
Company to Parent and (2) the Initial Outside Date (or, if applicable, the
Outside Date); provided, that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement and abandon the Mergers if the Company is then in
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, such that Parent would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a);

(b) at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
Company Board, upon recommendation of the SRC, shall have made a Change in
Recommendation in respect of a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section
6.01(c) and the Company Board has approved, and concurrently with such
termination, the Company entered into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of such Superior Proposal, but only if the Company is not then
in material breach of Section 6.01; provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.03(b) shall not be available unless the
Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.05(c); or

(c) (x) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 have been satisfied or
waived by Parent, (y) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Parent that (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to such conditions
being capable of being satisfied at the Closing if the Closing Date were the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.02) or Parent has
irrevocably waived in writing any such unsatisfied conditions and (B) the
Company, the Partnership and Partnership Merger Sub are ready, willing, and
able to consummate the Mergers, and (z) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Mergers within three (3) Business Days after the delivery by
the Company to Parent of such notice and the Company, the Partnership and
Partnership Merger Sub stood ready, willing and able to effect the Closing
through the end of such three (3) Business Day period.

8.04. Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated by Parent, upon
prior written notice to the Company, and the Mergers may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, whether before or after
the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained except as otherwise expressly
noted if:

(a) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation
and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such
that Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or
condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of
(1) 45 days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and
(2) the Initial Outside Date (or, if applicable, the Outside Date); provided,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon
the Mergers pursuant to this Section 8.04(a) if Parent or Merger Sub is then
in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the Company would be entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03(a); or

(b) the Company Board, upon the recommendation of the SRC, shall have made a
Change of Recommendation, or the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

8.05. Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

(a) Except as provided in Sections 8.05(b), 8.05(c) and 8.05(d) below, in the
event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Mergers
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any Party (or of any of
its Representatives or Affiliates); provided, however, and notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (1) no such termination shall
relieve any Party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful
material breach of this Agreement (subject only, with respect to any such
liability or damages of the Company or Parent, as applicable, to Sections
8.05(f) and 8.05(g)), and (2) the provisions set forth in Section 6.06(b), the
provisions of Section 6.18 which by their express terms survive any
termination, this Section 8.05 and ARTICLE IX and the relevant definitions
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.04(b), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than
two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay to Parent a
termination fee of $31,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by Parent.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.03(b), then the Company shall, prior to or concurrently with such
termination, pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated by Parent.

(d) In the event that (1) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections
8.02(a), 8.02(b) or 8.04(a), (2) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
received by the Company or its Representatives or any Person shall have
publicly proposed or publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal (and, in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.02(b), such Acquisition Proposal or publicly
proposed or announced intention shall have been made prior to the Stockholders
Meeting or termination of this Agreement (as applicable) and (3) within twelve
(12) months following the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters
into a definitive written agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal or
an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then, within two (2) Business Days
after the earlier of entry into a definitive agreement in respect of the
Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated by Parent (provided, that for purposes of this
8.05(d), the term "Acquisition Proposal" will have the meaning assigned to
such term herein, except that the references to "20%" and "80%" will be deemed
to be references to "50%").

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections
8.03(a) or 8.03(c), then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay to the Company a
termination fee of $53,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee"), by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by the Company.

(f) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee to
Parent, or Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee to the
Company, on more than one occasion. All payments under this Section 8.05 will
be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account designated by Parent
or the Company, as the case may be. Each of the Company, the Partnership,
Partnership Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (1) the
agreements contained in this Section 8.05 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) without these agreements,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Partnership and Partnership Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement and (3) neither the Termination Fee nor
the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the Company,
the Partnership and Partnership Merger Sub, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities forgone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, if either Party fails to pay the applicable
termination fee when due or any portion thereof and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other Party commences a suit which results in a final and
nonappealable Order against the other Party for such Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, or any portion thereof, the prevailing Party
shall pay to the other Party its documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable (or any portion thereof that has not been paid
timely in accordance with this Agreement), at the prime lending rate set forth
in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date of payment. Any interest payable hereunder shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but
excluding) the date of actual payment.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is paid pursuant to
this Section 8.05, Parent's right to receive payment of the Termination Fee
and such other amounts described herein or the Company's right to receive
payment of the Parent Termination Fee and such other amounts described herein,
as the case may be, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving
Party and its Affiliates and Representatives against the other Party and its
Affiliates and Representatives under this Agreement or arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the paying Party or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case,
whether based on Contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law or otherwise.

ARTICLE IX 

MISCELLANEOUS

9.01. Survival. The representations and warranties and pre-Closing agreements
and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Merger
Effective Time; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.01
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms
contemplated performance after the Merger Effective Time.

9.02. Waiver; Amendment. Before the Merger Effective Time, any provision of
this Agreement may be (a) waived by the Party benefited by the provision, but
only in writing, or (b) amended or modified at any time, but only by a written
agreement executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except to the extent
that any such amendment would violate the MGCL or require resubmission of the
Company Merger to the Company stockholders. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights hereunder or under applicable Law shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no
single or partial exercise by any Party of any of its rights hereunder
precludes any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights
hereunder or under applicable Law.

9.03. Governing Law. The execution, interpretation, and performance of this
Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Maryland without
giving effect to any conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State
of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any other jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland. EACH PARTY
HERETO, TO THE EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO, HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE CIRCUIT COURTS OF BALTIMORE CITY, MARYLAND AND TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND AND
APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF, AS WELL AS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ALL COURTS FROM
WHICH AN APPEAL MAY BE TAKEN OR OTHER REVIEW SOUGHT FROM THE AFORESAID COURTS,
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF SUCH PARTY'S
OBLIGATIONS UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS,
INSTRUMENTS OR DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (OTHER THAN THE CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT), AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL OBJECTIONS IT MAY HAVE AS TO
VENUE IN ANY OF SUCH COURTS.

9.04. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF
OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED
IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
NO PARTY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.04 HAVE
BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY THE PARTIES HERETO, AND THESE PROVISIONS SHALL BE
SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTIONS. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED
TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.04 SHALL NOT BE FULLY
ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

9.05. Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
monetary damages could not adequately compensate any Party hereto in the event
of a breach of the material terms of this Agreement by any other Party, (b)
the non-breaching Party would suffer irreparable harm in the event of such a
breach and (c) the non-breaching Party shall have, in addition to any other
rights or remedies it may have at law or in equity, specific performance and
injunctive relief as a remedy for the enforcement and to prevent breaches
hereof. The Parties agree to not seek, and agree to waive, any requirement for
the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the Party's seeking or
obtaining any relief pursuant to this Section 9.05. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (1) there is adequate remedy at Law or (2) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Without limiting the foregoing, if the Company has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03(c), the Company shall be entitled to
injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the obligation of Parent
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to
enforce the obligations of Parent and the Sponsor under the Equity Commitment
Letter. It is explicitly further agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to specifically
enforce Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to effect the Closing on the
terms and conditions set forth herein (as opposed to injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to force Parent and Merger Sub to
comply with their other obligations set forth herein (other than Parent's
and/or Merger Sub's obligations to effect the Closing)) only in the event that
all conditions in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing, each of which is then capable of being satisfied at a
Closing on such date) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for
the failure of Parent to comply with its obligations to effect the Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

9.06. Expenses. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement,
each Party shall bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.07. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications given or made
under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be deemed given when
personally delivered or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) to the Persons and addresses set forth below or such other place as
such Party may specify by notice.
