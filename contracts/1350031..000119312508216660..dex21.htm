iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of October 26,
2008, among Embarq Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Pine_ "),
CenturyTel, Inc., a Louisiana corporation (" _Cedar_ "), and Cajun Acquisition
Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cedar ("
_Pine Merger Sub_ ").

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Pine, the Board of Directors of Cedar, and
the Board of Directors of Pine Merger Sub have approved this Agreement,
determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of Pine,
Cedar or Pine Merger Sub, as applicable, and their respective stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable, and declared the advisability of this Agreement;

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Pine and the Board of Directors of
Pine Merger Sub have recommended adoption or approval, as applicable, of this
Agreement by their respective stockholders, as applicable;

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be, and
is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code; and

WHEREAS Pine, Cedar and Pine Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,

parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Pine Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into Pine (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Pine Merger Sub shall cease and
Pine shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ ").

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date
to be specified by Pine and Cedar, which shall be no later than the tenth
Business Day following the    satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth
in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing between Pine and Cedar; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived on such tenth
Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the tenth Business Day on
which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived, or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing between Pine and Cedar. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ "; _provided_
, _further_ , that the Closing Date shall not occur before November 19, 2008.

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the

accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon
as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Pine and Cedar shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws._ The certificate of
incorporation of Pine Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be
Embarq Corporation. The by-laws of Pine Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that references to the name of Pine Merger Sub shall be replaced by
references to the name of the Surviving Company.

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company._ The directors of
Pine Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case

2 ARTICLE II

_Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

SECTION 2.01.  _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Pine, Cedar, Pine Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of Pine Common Stock or Pine Merger Sub Common
Stock:

(a) _Conversion of Pine Merger Sub Common Stock._ Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, in Pine Merger Sub (the " _Pine Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into 1 fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and after
the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Pine Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Cedar-Owned Stock._ Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01, of Pine (the " _Pine Common Stock_ ") that is
owned by Pine as treasury stock and each share of Pine Common Stock that is
owned by Cedar or Pine Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Pine Common Stock._ Subject to Section 2.02, each share of
Pine Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b))
shall be converted into the right to receive 1.37 fully paid and
nonassessable shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Cedar Common Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Pine Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of
shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Pine Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Cedar Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without
interest. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Cedar Common_  



 

3   _Stock_ " means the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Cedar.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Cedar Common Stock or Pine
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained
herein which is based upon the number of shares of Cedar Common Stock or Pine
Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide
to Cedar and the holders of Pine Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. As provided in Section
2.02(j), the right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any
withholding under applicable Tax Law.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Cedar shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Pine to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Cedar
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Cedar Common Stock to
be issued as Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to make payments in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such Cedar Common Stock
and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Letter of Transmittal._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Cedar shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Pine Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Cedar
may specify subject to Pines reasonable approval), together with instructions
thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange._ Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Pine Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
in the case of shares of Pine Common Stock held in book-entry form, the
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Merger Consideration into
which such shares of Pine Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section
2.01 and (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the
right to receive  



 

4  pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other
distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Pine Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of Pine, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Cedar Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01 and
cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other
distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Pine Common Stock (or, if such Pine Common Stock is held in book-entry form,
proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Pine Common
Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time
from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of Pine
Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant
to Section 2.01 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.02(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Pine Common Stock
held in book-entry form).

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Cedar Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Pine Common Stock held in book-entry form) with
respect to the shares of Cedar Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of such Certificate
(or shares of Pine Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of Pine Common Stock held in
book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Cedar Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Cedar Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Cedar Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Cedar Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Pine Common Stock._ The shares of Cedar
Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Pine Common Stock (including any
cash paid pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section 2.02) shall be deemed to
have been issued and paid in full  



 

5  satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Pine Common Stock.
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares
of Pine Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing
shares of Pine Common Stock (or shares of Pine Common Stock held in book-
entry form) are presented to Cedar or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(f) _No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Cedar Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Pine
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Pine Common Stock converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Cedar Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Pine
Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by
the last reported sale price of Cedar Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Cedar
and Pine) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective
Time (the " _Cedar Closing Price_ ").

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Pine Common Stock for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Cedar, upon demand, and any holder of
Pine Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Cedar for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
II, in each case without any interest thereon.

(h) _No Liability._ None of Pine, Cedar, Pine Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Cedar, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Cedar. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Cedar.



 

6 (j) _Withholding Rights._ Each of Cedar and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Pine Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Pine
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(k) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Cedar, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Cedar may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties of Cedar and Pine Merger Sub_

Cedar and Pine Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to Pine
that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct except
as set forth in the Cedar SEC Documents filed and publicly available after
January 1, 2008 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Cedar
SEC Documents_ ") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed Cedar SEC Documents
in any risk factors section, in any section related to forward looking
statements and other disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or in the disclosure letter delivered by Cedar to Pine at or before
the execution and delivery by Cedar and Pine Merger Sub of this Agreement
(the " _Cedar Disclosure Letter_ "). The Cedar Disclosure Letter shall be
arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any
section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this Article III to the
extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably apparent from the face
of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such
other sections. 

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of Cedar and each of
Cedars Subsidiaries (the " _Cedar Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Cedar
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Cedar Material Adverse Effect. Each of Cedar
and the  



 

7  Cedar Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and possesses all
governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary to
enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its businesses as presently conducted (the " _Cedar Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have such power or authority or to possess Cedar
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Cedar Material Adverse Effect. Each of Cedar
and the Cedar Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Cedar Material Adverse Effect. Cedar has delivered or made available to
Pine, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of (a)
the amended and restated articles of incorporation of Cedar in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the " _Cedar Articles_ ") and the by-laws of Cedar
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Cedar By-laws_ ") and (b)

SECTION 3.04. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._ (a) Each of
Cedar and Pine Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject, in the case of the Share Issuance, to the receipt of the
Cedar Shareholder Approval and, in the case of the Merger, for the approval
of this Agreement by Cedar as the sole stockholder of Pine Merger Sub. The
Board of Directors of Cedar (the " _Cedar Board_ ") has adopted resolutions,
by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of
Cedar was present, (i) approving the execution, delivery and  



 

10  performance of this Agreement, (ii) determining that entering into this
Agreement is in the best interests of Cedar and its shareholders, (iii)
declaring this Agreement advisable and (iv) recommending that Cedars
shareholders vote in favor of approval of the issuance of Cedar Common Stock
constituting the Merger Consideration (the " _Share Issuance_ ")
and directing that the Share Issuance be submitted to Cedars shareholders
for approval at a duly held meeting of such shareholders for such purpose (the
" _Cedar Shareholders Meeting_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. The Board of Directors
of Pine Merger Sub has adopted resolutions (i) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of
this Agreement are in the best interests of Pine Merger Sub and Cedar, as its
sole stockholder, (iii) declaring this Agreement advisable and (iv)
recommending that Cedar, as sole stockholder of Pine Merger Sub, adopt this
Agreement and directing that this Agreement be submitted to Cedar, as sole
stockholder of Pine Merger Sub, for adoption. As of the date of this
Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. Cedar, as sole
stockholder of Pine Merger Sub, will, immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto, adopt this
Agreement. Except (x) solely in the case of the Share Issuance, for the
approval of the Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the voting power of the shares of Cedar Common Stock and Cedar
Preferred Stock represented in person or by proxy at the Cedar Shareholders
Meeting, as required by Section 312.03(c) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual
(the " _Cedar Shareholder Approval_ "), and (y) solely in the case of the
Merger, for the adoption of this Agreement by Cedar as the sole stockholder of
Pine Merger Sub, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Cedar or Pine
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents
as required by the DGCL). Each of Cedar and Pine Merger Sub has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Pine, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. In order to
amend Article III.C of the Cedar Articles to reduce the voting rights granted
thereby to holders of Cedar High Vote Stock to the same voting rights to which
holders of other shares of Cedar Common Stock are entitled, the only required
vote of the Cedar shareholders is the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
voting power of holders of Cedar Common Stock present at an annual or special
meeting of shareholders at which a majority of the voting power of holders of
Cedar Common Stock is present (the " _Cedar High Vote Shareholder Approval_
").

(b) The Cedar By-laws render LBCL Sections 12:135 through 12:140.2
inapplicable to the Merger. No "fair price", "moratorium", "control share
acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or
regulation applies with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

11 SECTION 3.05. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by each
of Cedar and Pine Merger Sub of this Agreement does not, and the performance
by it of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Cedar or any Cedar Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Cedar

documents of any Cedar Subsidiary (assuming that the Cedar Shareholder
Approval is obtained), (ii) any contract, lease, license, indenture, note,
bond, agreement, concession, franchise or other instrument (a " _Contract_ ")
to which Cedar or any Cedar Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or any Cedar Permit or (iii) subject
to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any
judgment, order or decree (" _Judgment_ ") or statute, law (including common
law), ordinance, rule or regulation (" _Law_ "), in each case, applicable to
Cedar or any Cedar Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets
(assuming that the Cedar Shareholder Approval is obtained), other than, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Cedar
Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section
3.05(a), effects resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set
forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect"
shall not be excluded in determining whether a Cedar Material Adverse Effect
has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent
or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger.

(b) No consent, approval, clearance, waiver, Permit or order (" _Consent_ ")
of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing made to or with

Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than (i) (A)
the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") of the

connection with the issuance by Cedar of the Merger Consideration, in which
the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus (the " _Form
S-4_"), and (C) the filing with the SEC of such reports under, and such other
compliance with, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "

resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in clause
(iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be
excluded in determining whether a Cedar Material Adverse Effect has occurred
or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or materially

material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the consolidated financial statements of Cedar included in the Cedar SEC

requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted

thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated

applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under
the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Cedar
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true

arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Cedars properties or assets. 

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Cedar are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Cedar in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Cedar, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Cedar to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

 

14 (g) Neither Cedar nor any of the Cedar Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Cedar and any of
the Cedar Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,

award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of
the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable
interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and the final Treasury Regulations
issued thereunder and all subsequent IRS Notices and other interim guidance on

meet all the requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended
to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded and/or book reserved, as
appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

SECTION 3.11. _Litigation._ There is no suit, action or other proceeding

(it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 3.11, effects resulting

Pine represents and warrants to Cedar and Pine Merger Sub that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true and correct except as set forth in the
Pine SEC Documents filed and publicly available after January 1, 2008 and
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Pine SEC Documents_ ")
(excluding any disclosures in the Filed Pine SEC Documents in any risk factors
section, in any section related to forward looking statements and other
disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in
the disclosure letter delivered by Pine to Cedar at or before the execution
and delivery by Pine of this Agreement (the " _Pine Disclosure Letter_ "). The
Pine Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in
this Article IV, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify
other sections in this Article IV to the extent (and only to the extent) that
it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections.

SECTION 4.01.  _Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of Pine and each of
Pines Subsidiaries (the " _Pine Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction
recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Pine Subsidiaries, where
the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Pine Material Adverse Effect. Each of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it
to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted (the " _Pine Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have such power or authority or to possess Pine Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect. Each of Pine and the Pine
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction
where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Pine Material Adverse Effect. Pine has delivered or made available to
Cedar, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Pine in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (the " _Pine Charter_ ") and the by-laws of Pine in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Pine By-laws_ ").

SECTION 4.02.  _Pine Subsidiaries._ (a) All the outstanding shares of capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, each Pine
Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and

Subsidiary, free and clear of all  



 

30  material Liens, and free of any other restriction (including any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock,

by applicable securities laws. Section 4.02(a) of the Pine Disclosure Letter
sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the
Pine Subsidiaries. 

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Pine Subsidiaries, neither Pine nor any Pine Subsidiary

of performance goals at "target" and (v) 745,936 shares of Pine Common Stock
were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Pine 2008 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Pine ESPP_ "). Except as set forth in this Section 4.03(a), at
the close of business on October 23, 2008, no shares of capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Pine were issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding. From the close of business on October 23, 2008 to

or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Pine or any Pine
Subsidiary, (y) any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from

Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in,
Pine or any Pine Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued by or other obligations
of Pine or any Pine Subsidiary that are linked in any way to the price of any
class of Pine Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of any Pine
Subsidiary, the value of Pine, any Pine Subsidiary or any part of Pine or any
Pine Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on
any shares of capital stock of Pine or any Pine Subsidiary. Except for
acquisitions, or deemed acquisitions, of Pine Common Stock or other equity

rights referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding
sentence. With respect to Pine Stock Options, (i) each grant of a Pine Stock

is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Pine. Neither
Pine nor any of the Pine Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement pursuant to
which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or nominate any director of
Pine or any of the Pine Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.04. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._ (a) Pine
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the
case of the Merger, to the receipt of the Pine Stockholder Approval. The Board
of Directors of Pine (the " _Pine Board_ ") has adopted resolutions, by

32  called at which a quorum of directors of Pine was present, (i) approving the

amended or withdrawn. Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pine Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Pine Stockholders Meeting (the " _Pine
Stockholder Approval_ "), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Pine
are necessary to authorize or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the
filing of the appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). Pine has
duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Cedar, this Agreement constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms.

(b) The Pine Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to
render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement the restrictions on "business combinations" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.
No "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 4.05. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by Pine
of this Agreement does not, and the performance by it of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or redeem any
Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Pine or any Pine Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Pine Charter, the
Pine By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any
Pine Subsidiary (assuming that the Pine Stockholder Approval is obtained),
(ii) any Contract to which Pine or any Pine Subsidiary is a party or by which
any of their respective properties or assets is bound or any Pine Permit or
(iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section
4.05(b), any Judgment or Law, in each case, applicable to Pine or any Pine
Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets (assuming that the Pine
Stockholder Approval is obtained), other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse
Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.05(a), effects
resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth  



 

33  in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall
not be excluded in determining whether a Pine Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger.

(b) No Consent of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing made
to or with any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or
with respect to Pine or any Pine Subsidiary in connection with the execution

the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
the other jurisdictions in which Cedar and Pine are qualified to do business,

required to be made or obtained under the securities or "blue sky" laws of
various states in connection with the issuance of the Merger Consideration,
(v) such Consents from, or registrations, declarations, notices or filings
made to or with, the FCC or any other Governmental Entities (including State
Regulators) (other than with respect to securities, antitrust, competition,
trade regulation or similar Laws), in each case as may be required in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and are required with respect to mergers or
business combinations of telecommunications companies generally, (vi) such
filings with and approvals of the NYSE as are required to permit the
consummation of the Merger and the listing of the Merger Consideration and

(it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.05(b), effects resulting
from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in clause (iv) of the
definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in
determining whether a Pine Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger.

or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) required to be
furnished or filed by Pine with the SEC since January 1, 2007 (such documents,
together with any documents filed with the SEC during such period by Pine on
a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, but excluding the Joint
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the "
_Pine SEC Documents_ ").



 

34 (b) Each Pine SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Pine SEC Document and (ii) did not at the time
it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to
the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of Pine included
in the Pine SEC Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Pine
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in Pines consolidated audited
balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 (or the notes thereto) as included in

absolute, contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate,
have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of Pine and the chief financial
officer of Pine (or each former chief executive officer of Pine and each
former chief financial officer of Pine, as applicable) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Pine SEC Documents,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate.
None of Pine or any of the Pine Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged
any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers
within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

(e) Pine maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Pines
properties or assets.



 

35 (f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Pine are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Pine in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Pine, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Pine to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(g) Neither Pine nor any of the Pine Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Pine
and any of the Pine Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Pine or any of the Pine Subsidiaries in Pines or such Pine
Subsidiarys published financial statements or other Pine SEC Documents.

(h) Since January 1, 2008, none of Pine, Pines independent accountants, the
Pine Board or the audit committee of the Pine Board has received any oral or
written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the internal
controls over financial reporting of Pine, (y) "material weakness" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Pine or (z) fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees of Pine who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of Pine.

(i) None of the Pine Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1, 2007
been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

be supplied by Pine for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto
is declared effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the
Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to each of Cedars
shareholders and Pines stockholders or at the time of each of the  



 

36  Cedar Shareholders Meeting and the Pine Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by Pine with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Cedar or Pine Merger Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.

SECTION 4.08. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Since January 1, 2008,
there has not occurred any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect,
(i) no Pine Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Section 4971 of the Code (a " _Pine Pension
Plan_ ") had, as of the respective last annual valuation date for each such

trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect,
(i) each Pine Benefit Plan and its related trust, insurance contract or other
funding vehicle has been administered in accordance with its terms and is in
compliance with ERISA, the

any other material obligation under any Pine Benefit Plan or (C) result in any

understanding or otherwise, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect.

(j) Each Pine Benefit Plan that provides for "nonqualified deferred
compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code, and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of
the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable

insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded.



 

41 (l) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect, there does not
now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled
Group Liability that would be a liability of Pine or any Pine Subsidiary
following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not

to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded and/or book reserved, as
appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

SECTION 4.11. _Litigation._ There is no suit, action or other proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Pine, threatened against Pine or any Pine
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets that, individually

the Knowledge of Pine, investigation by any Governmental Entity involving Pine
or any Pine Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Pine Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this
Section 4.11, effects resulting from or arising in connection with the

expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect, Pine and the Pine
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws and Pine Permits,

that for purposes of this Section 4.13(a)(ii), effects resulting from or

condition, to support the operations of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries as
presently conducted, except in respects that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Pine
Material Adverse Effect. All of the Pine Properties are free and clear of all
Liens, except for Liens on material Pine Properties that, individually or in

Property to which they relate in the conduct of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries
as presently conducted and Liens on other Pine Properties that, individually

as, individually or in the aggregate, do not materially impair and would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair, the continued use and operation
of such material assets to which they relate in the conduct of Pine and Pine

immaterial properties or assets as, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse
Effect. 

SECTION 4.16. _Intellectual Property._ Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries own, or

expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect. No actions, suits or other
proceedings are pending or, to the Knowledge of Pine, threatened that Pine or
any of the Pine Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating the rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property
Right, except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Pine Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each Pine License is valid and in full force and effect and has not been
suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified, except where the failure

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation by Cedar; Cedar Board Recommendation._ (a)
Cedar shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any
of its and their respective directors, officers or employees or any of
their respective investment bankers, accountants, attorneys or other
advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to,
(i) directly or indirectly solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce
or facilitate any Cedar Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Cedar Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly
or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a Person making a Cedar
Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Cedar Takeover Proposal or any inquiry
or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Cedar Takeover
Proposal. Cedar shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Cedar Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Cedar Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished, immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives,
and, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, take such action as is
necessary to enforce any "standstill" provisions or provisions of similar
effect to which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Cedar Shareholder Approval,
in response to a bona fide written Cedar Takeover Proposal that the Cedar
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Cedar Proposal, and which Cedar
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date of this Agreement and was
made after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Cedar Shareholders
Meeting and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a),
Cedar may, subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish information
with respect to Cedar and the Cedar Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Cedar Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) ( _provided _  



 

58  that all such information has previously been provided to Pine or is
provided to Pine prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than with respect to standstill provisions), and (y) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Cedar Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Cedar
Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.02(a) by any Representative of Cedar or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by Cedar.

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Cedar Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Pine), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Pine), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Cedar Board or
any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Cedar Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Cedar Adverse Recommendation Change_
") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow Cedar or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement (an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Cedar Takeover Proposal, or requiring,
or reasonably expected to cause, Cedar or Pine Merger Sub to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, Cedar or Pine Merger Sub to fail to comply with this
Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Cedar Shareholder Approval, the Cedar Board may make a Cedar Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Cedar Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Cedar shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Cedar Adverse
Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business Day following Pines
receipt of written notice (a " _Cedar Notice of Recommendation Change_ ")
from Cedar advising Pine that the Cedar Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including in the case of a Superior Cedar
Proposal, the terms and conditions of any Superior Cedar Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action by the Cedar Board (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Cedar Proposal
shall require a new Cedar Notice of Recommendation Change and a new five
business-day period). In determining whether to make a Cedar Adverse  



 

59  Recommendation Change, the Cedar Board shall take into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Pine in response to a Cedar Notice
of Recommendation Change or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Cedar set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.02, Cedar shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours of the receipt thereof, advise Pine orally and in writing of any Cedar
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Cedar
Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
person making any such Cedar Takeover Proposal. Cedar shall (x) keep Pine
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis of the
status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Cedar
Takeover Proposal, and (y) provide to Pine as soon as practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written
material exchanged between Cedar or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Cedar Takeover
Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Cedar from (x)
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to
the shareholders of Cedar if, in the good faith judgment of the Cedar Board
(after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Cedar Board
with respect to this Agreement or a Cedar Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Cedar Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Cedar Board in connection
with such communication publicly reaffirms its recommendation with respect to
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Cedar or the
Cedar Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action, or make any statement, that would violate Section 5.02(b).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Cedar Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination or similar transaction involving Cedar or any Cedar
Subsidiary, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or
indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or
other equity interests in a Cedar Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or
assets of Cedar or the Cedar Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Cedar and the Cedar
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or
group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)  



 

60  representing 20% or more of the voting power of Cedar, (iv) transaction in
which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has
the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the Cedar Common
Stock or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the
Merger).

" _Superior Cedar Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a
third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a parent-to-
parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such third
party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the
Cedar Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of Cedar and the Cedar
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which the Cedar Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial
point of view to the holders of Cedar Common Stock than the Merger, taking
into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes proposed by Pine to the terms of this Agreement), and
(ii) that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

SECTION 5.03. _No Solicitation by Pine; Pine Board Recommendation._ (a) Pine
shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of
its and their respective Representatives to, (i) directly or indirectly
solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Pine
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Pine Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way
with any Person (whether or not a Person making a Pine Takeover Proposal)
with respect to any Pine Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Pine Takeover Proposal. Pine shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Pine
Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Pine Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished, immediately terminate
all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives, and, between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, take such action as is necessary to enforce any "standstill" provisions
or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a
beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Pine Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Pine
Takeover Proposal that the Pine Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Pine Proposal, and which Pine Takeover  



 

61  Proposal was not solicited after the date of this Agreement and was made
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Pine Stockholders Meeting
and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.03(a), Pine may,
subject to compliance with Section 5.03(c), (x) furnish information with
respect to Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries to the Person making such Pine
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to Pine or is provided to Pine prior
to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other than with respect to
standstill provisions), and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms
of such Pine Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and
only with, the Person making such Pine Takeover Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03(a) by any
Representative of Pine or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Pine.

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Pine Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Cedar), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Cedar), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Pine Board or
any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or (B) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Pine Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Pine Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow Pine or any of its Affiliates to
execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Pine
Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Pine to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, Pine to fail to comply with this Agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.03(a)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Pine Stockholder Approval, the
Pine Board may make a Pine Adverse Recommendation Change if the Pine Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Pine shall not be entitled to exercise its right
to make a Pine Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business
Day following Cedars receipt of written notice (a " _Pine Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") from Pine advising Cedar that the Pine Board intends
to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including in the case
of a Superior Pine Proposal, the terms and conditions of any Superior Pine
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Pine Board (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior
Pine Proposal shall require a new Pine Notice of  



 

62  Recommendation Change and a new five business-day period). In determining
whether to make a Pine Adverse Recommendation Change, the Pine Board shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Cedar in response to a Pine Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Pine set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this Section 5.03, Pine shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of
the receipt thereof, advise Cedar orally and in writing of any Pine Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Pine Takeover Proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such
Pine Takeover Proposal. Pine shall (x) keep Cedar informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably current basis of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any Pine Takeover Proposal, and
(y) provide to Cedar as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged between
Pine or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms
or conditions of any Pine Takeover Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit Pine from (x) taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Pine if, in the good faith judgment of the Pine Board (after
consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Pine Board with
respect to this Agreement or a Pine Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Pine Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Pine Board in connection with
such communication publicly reaffirms its recommendation with respect to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Pine or the Pine
Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action,
or make any statement, that would violate Section 5.03(b).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Pine Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination or similar transaction involving Pine or any Pine
Subsidiary, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or
indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or
other equity interests in a Pine Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or
assets of Pine or the Pine Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)  



 

63  representing 20% or more of the voting power of Pine, (iv) transaction in
which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has
the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the Pine Common
Stock or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the
Merger).

" _Superior Pine Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a
third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a parent-to-
parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such third
party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the
Pine Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of Pine and the Pine
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which the Pine Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of
view to the holders of Pine Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including
any changes proposed by Cedar to the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) that
is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

Merger Consideration for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of
Pine and Cedar shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Pine and
Cedar shall also take any other action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state
securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in
connection with the Merger and the issuance of the Merger Consideration.

65 (d) Cedar shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Cedar Shareholders Meeting
for the sole purposes of seeking the Cedar Shareholder Approval, the Cedar
High Vote Shareholder Approval, and any proposal to amend the Cedar Articles
to increase the number of authorized shares of Cedar Common Stock. Cedar
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Joint Proxy Statement
to be mailed to Cedars shareholders and to hold the Cedar Shareholders
Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and (ii) subject to Section 5.02(b),
solicit the Cedar Shareholder Approval and the Cedar High Vote Shareholder
Approval. Cedar shall, through the Cedar Board, recommend to its shareholders
that they give the Cedar Shareholder Approval and the Cedar High Vote
Shareholder Approval and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, except to the extent that the Cedar Board shall have made a Cedar
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.02(b).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01(d), if on a date
for which the Cedar Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, Cedar has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Cedar Common Stock to
obtain the Cedar Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,
Cedar shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Cedar Shareholders Meeting, provided that the Cedar
Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
30 days after the date for which the Cedar Shareholders Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law). Cedar agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Cedar of any Cedar Takeover Proposal, by the making of any
Cedar Adverse Recommendation Change by the Cedar Board; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the public announcement of a Cedar Adverse Recommendation Change or
the delivery of a Cedar Notice of Recommendation Change is less than
10 Business Days prior to the Cedar Shareholders Meeting, Cedar shall be
entitled to postpone the Cedar Shareholders Meeting to a date not less than 10
Business Days after such event.

Stockholder Approval. Pine shall, through the Pine Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they give the Pine Stockholder Approval and shall include
such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, except to the extent that
the Pine Board shall have made a Pine Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by Section 5.03(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.01(d), if on a date for which the Pine Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, Pine has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Pine Common Stock to obtain the Pine Stockholder Approval, whether
or not a  



 

66  quorum is present, Pine shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Pine Stockholders Meeting, provided that
the Pine Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than 30 days after the date for which the Pine Stockholders Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law). Pine agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to Pine of any Pine Takeover Proposal or by the
making of any Pine Adverse Recommendation Change by the Pine Board;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the public announcement of a Pine Adverse
Recommendation Change or the delivery of a Pine Notice of Recommendation
Change is less than 10 Business Days prior to the Pine Shareholders Meeting,
Pine shall be entitled to postpone the Pine Shareholders Meeting to a date not
less than 10 Business Days after such event.

SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to applicable
Law, each of Cedar and Pine shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the Representatives of such
other party reasonable access during the period prior to the Effective Time to
all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, during such period, each of Cedar and Pine shall, and shall
cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other
party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that either party may withhold any document or
information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with
a third party ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access
or disclosure) or subject to any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that
the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). If any material is withheld
by such party pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, such party
shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being
withheld. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Pine and
Cedar shall, within two Business Days of request by the other party therefor,
provide to such other party the information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii)
under the Exchange Act and any information to which a holder of Pine
Common Stock or Cedar Common Stock, as applicable, would be entitled under
Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such
section). All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement dated August 12, 2008 between Cedar
and Pine (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

SECTION 6.03. _Required Actions._ (a) Each of the parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things reasonably appropriate to consummate and make effective,
as soon as reasonably possible, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

67 (b) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), Pine and the Pine
Board and Cedar and the Cedar Board shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably appropriate to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably appropriate
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), promptly
following the execution and delivery by the parties of this Agreement,
Pine and Cedar shall enter into discussions with the Governmental Entities
from whom Consents or nonactions are required to be obtained in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in order to obtain all such required Consents or nonactions
from such Governmental Entities and eliminate each and every other impediment
that may be asserted by such Governmental Entities, in each case with respect
to the Merger, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible. To the extent necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing and
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.03(e), Pine and Cedar shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to jointly negotiate, commit to
and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership
or operation by Pine, Cedar or any of their respective Subsidiaries of
any portion of the business, properties or assets of Pine, Cedar or any of
their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Cedar nor
Pine shall be required pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) to commit to or effect
any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. If
the actions taken by Cedar and Pine pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence do not result in the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(d), (e) and
(f) being satisfied, then each of Cedar and Pine shall jointly (to the extent
practicable) use their reasonable best efforts to initiate and/or participate
in any proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order to (i) oppose
or defend against any action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and/or (ii) take such action as necessary to overturn any
regulatory action by any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by defending any suit, action or other legal proceeding brought by
any Governmental Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Legal
Restraint resulting from any suit, action or other legal proceeding that would
cause any condition set forth in Section 7.01(d), (e) or (f) not to be
satisfied; _provided_ that Cedar and Pine shall cooperate with one another in
connection with, and shall jointly control, all proceedings related to the
foregoing.



 

68 (d) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Cedar and Pine shall:

(i) make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other
and as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (A) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
relating to the Merger and (B) all other necessary registrations,
declarations, notices and filings relating to the Merger with other
Governmental Entities under any other antitrust, competition, trade regulation
or similar Laws;

(ii) (A) make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the
other and as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all

and any State Regulators (the " _PSC Applications_ ") to effect the transfer
of control of the Pine Licenses and/or Cedar Licenses, as necessary to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any additional requests for information
received from the FCC or any State Regulator by any party to an FCC
Application or PSC Application and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to
cure not later than the Effective Time any violations or defaults under any
FCC Rules or rules of any State Regulator, except for such violations or
defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Substantial Detriment;

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all assistance,
cooperation and information required for any such registration, declaration,
notice or filing and in order to achieve the effects set forth in Section
6.03(c);

(iv) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such registration,
declaration, notice or filing and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of
any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section
6.03(c)), and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in
connection with any such registration, declaration, notice, filing or
communication;

(v) use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received  



 

69  from any Governmental Entity or any other authority enforcing applicable
antitrust, competition, trade regulation or similar Laws for additional
information or documentation in connection with antitrust, competition, trade
regulation or similar matters (including a "second request" under the HSR
Act), and not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with such Governmental Entities or other authorities not to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and 

(vi) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or
attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation with any
Governmental Entity in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of
the actions referred to in Section 6.03(c)) without the other, (B) to the
extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any
such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating in
or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such
party reasonably apprised with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of
any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other
written communications explaining or defending this Agreement and the Merger,
articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E) furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, except that any
materials concerning valuation of the other party may be redacted or withheld.

(e) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein but subject to the proviso
of the second sentence of Section 6.03(c), the provisions of this Section
6.03 shall not be construed to require or permit Pine, Cedar, or their
respective Subsidiaries from offering, taking, committing to or accepting any
action, restrictions or limitations (" _Actions_ ") of or on Pine, Cedar, or
their respective Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other
party if such Actions, individually or in the aggregate, would or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment.

(f) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, (i) neither
Cedar nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
shall cooperate with any other party in seeking regulatory clearance of any
Cedar Takeover Proposal and  



 

70 (ii) neither Pine nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives shall cooperate with any other party in seeking regulatory
clearance of any Pine Takeover Proposal.

(g) Cedar shall give prompt notice to Pine, and Pine shall give prompt notice
to Cedar, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by
it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.04. _Stock Plans; Benefit Plans._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Pine Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such
resolutions as are necessary to effect the following:

(i) unless otherwise specifically agreed with any particular holder of a Pine
Stock Option, adjust the terms of all outstanding Pine Stock Options to
provide that, at the Effective Time, each Pine Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an option
(a " _Converted Cedar Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Pine Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a number of shares of Cedar Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Pine Common Stock subject to such Pine
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Pine Stock Option
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Pine Stock Option (x) which is an "incentive stock
option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (y) shall be
adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the Code;

(ii) unless otherwise specifically agreed with any particular holder of a Pine
Restricted Stock Unit, adjust the terms of all outstanding Pine Restricted
Stock Units to provide that, at the Effective Time, each award of Pine
Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall represent, immediately after the Effective Time, the right to receive,
on the same terms and conditions (other than the terms and conditions
relating to the achievement of performance goals) as were applicable under
such Pine Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the  



 

71  Effective Time, a number of shares of Cedar Common Stock, rounded up to the
nearest whole share, equal to the product of (1) the applicable
Performance Adjusted RSU Amount (as defined below), multiplied by (2) the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that acceleration of vesting of a Pine Restricted Stock Unit as of the
Effective Time causes such Pine Restricted Stock Unit to be settled for
shares of Pine Common Stock at the Effective Time, such shares of Pine Common
Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.10(c); and 

(iii) with respect to the Pine ESPP, (A) each purchase right under the Pine
ESPP outstanding on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically suspended and any contributions made for the then-current
Offering (as defined in the Pine ESPP) will be returned to Pine ESPP
participants, and (B) the Pine ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately as
of the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of this Section 6.04, the term " _Performance Adjusted
RSU Amount_ " shall mean, with respect to any award of Pine Restricted Stock
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares
of Pine Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the product of (A) the total
number of shares of Pine Common Stock that would be delivered to the holder
of such award based on the actual achievement of the performance goals
applicable to such award (if any) during the portion of the applicable
performance period ending on the Business Day prior to the Effective Time, as
reasonably determined by the Pine Board (or a committee thereof), and assuming
the satisfaction of all other conditions to such delivery, multiplied by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the performance
period applicable to such award that elapsed between the first day of the
performance period applicable to such award and the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such performance period
(the " _Pro Ration Fraction_ "), and rounded up to the nearest four decimal
places, and (ii) the product of (A) the target number of shares of Pine Common
Stock subject to such award (assuming the satisfaction of all conditions to
such delivery, including target-level achievement of the performance goals
applicable to such award) multiplied by (B) a fraction equal to one minus the
Pro Ration Fraction, and rounded up to the nearest four decimal places. 

(c) At the Effective Time, Cedar shall assume all the obligations of Pine
under the Pine Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted Cedar Option and Pine
Restricted Stock Unit and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Cedar shall deliver to the
holders of Converted Cedar Stock Options and Pine Restricted Stock Units
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights, and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Converted Cedar Options and Pine Restricted
Stock Units shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject
to the adjustments required by this Section 6.04 after giving effect to the
Merger).



 

72 (d) Cedar shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Cedar Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
or settlement of the Converted Cedar Options and Pine Restricted Stock Units
in accordance with this Section 6.04. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Cedar shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Cedar
Common Stock subject to Converted Cedar Options and Pine Restricted Stock
Units and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Converted Cedar Options and Pine Restricted Stock
Units remain outstanding.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Pine Benefit
Plans, but subject to Section 6.04(e) of the Pine Disclosure Letter, for
purposes of the Pine Benefit Plans (including the Pine Stock Plans), Pine may,
but shall not be obligated to, deem the consummation of the Merger to
constitute a "change in control" or "change of control", as applicable.

included in the certificates described in this Section 6.07.

arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities or otherwise
replace or amend the Commitment Letter so long as such action would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or add conditions or
otherwise materially restrict the availability of the Financing). In the event
that Cedar becomes aware that any portion of the Financing is unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Cedar
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing for such
portion from alternative sources. Cedar shall not agree to nor permit any
amendment, modification or waiver (other than a waiver of a condition to the

written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(b) Pine shall provide, shall cause the Pine Subsidiaries to provide, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives

77  reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing

and presentations, providing information, documents, opinions and
certificates, entering into agreements, and other actions that are or may be
customary in connection with the Financing or necessary to permit Cedar to
fulfill conditions or obligations under the Commitment Letter and related fee

required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or enter into any
definitive agreement or incur any other liability in connection with the
Financing.

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding either
party obtained by the other party pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) shall be

with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities

following the Effective Time, the employees of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries

_Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and
benefits provided to such employees of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



 

78 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Cedar or any of
the Cedar Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate (but not for purpose of
early retirement programs), level of benefits including benefit accruals
(other than benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies under any defined
benefit pension plan) and vesting, service recognized by Pine and any Pine
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
service with Cedar or the Cedar Subsidiaries; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding that Pine service shall be recognized by Cedar benefit plans
in accordance with the forgoing, the date of initial participation of each
Continuing Employee in any Cedar benefit plan shall be no earlier than the
Effective Time; further provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that (i) such Cedar employee benefit plan does not
recognize service of similarly situated employees of Cedar or (ii) such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and Pine shall
take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Cedar to continue any
specific plans or to continue the employment, or any changes to the terms and
conditions of the employment, of any specific person. Furthermore, no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the
ability of Cedar to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, agreements or understandings of Cedar or Pine. Without
limiting the scope of Section 9.07, nothing in this Section 6.14 shall confer
any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee
or any other person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Cedar or any Cedar
Subsidiary in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Cedar or such Cedar Subsidiary shall (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the analogous welfare plans of Pine and the Pine Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket
maximums incurred prior to the Effective Time and during the portion of the
plan year of the applicable Pine welfare plan ending at the Effective Time, in
satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the
extent applicable under any such plan.

(e) Each of Cedar and Pine agrees that, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the other party,
it will not and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit for hire or hire any director-level or more senior employee of the
other party or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
provision will not prohibit such party from (i) hiring any such person who has
not been employed by the other party during the preceding six months or (ii)
making any general public solicitation not designed to circumvent these
provisions.



 

79 (f) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
constitute an amendment to any Cedar Benefit Plan or Pine Benefit Plan or any
other compensation or benefits plan maintained for or provided to employees,
directors or consultants of Cedar or Pine prior to or following the Effective
Time.

SECTION 6.15. _Amendment to Cedar Articles._ If the Cedar High Vote
Shareholder Approval is obtained at the Cedar Shareholders Meeting, Cedar
shall immediately prior to Closing take all actions necessary to amend the
Cedar Articles to eliminate the effect of Article III.C therein on any shares
of Cedar Common Stock.

SECTION 6.16. _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Cedar or Pine, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the other partys operations prior to the Effective Time.

sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.06, this Section 8.02 and Article IX,
which provisions shall survive such termination, and except in the case of

forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 8.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Cedar Shareholder Approval or the Pine

Pine unless such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an

to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any
Exhibit but not otherwise defined  



 

90  therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a Person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America.

SECTION 9.05. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 9.06. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

SECTION 9.07. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This
Agreement, taken together with the Cedar Disclosure Letter and the Pine
Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except for Section
6.05, is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any
rights or remedies.

SECTION 9.08. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.



 

91 SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that the rights,
interests and obligations of Pine Merger Sub may be assigned to another
wholly owned subsidiary of Cedar. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement._ The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that,
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a) below,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for
any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto
(a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware
state court or any Federal court located in the State of Delaware in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any
Delaware state court or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other
parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.11.

_Pine/Cedar Merger_

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, an officer of Cedar, a Louisiana corporation ("Cedar"), has
been asked to make certain representations in connection with the opinions to
be delivered pursuant to Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of [ ], 2008 (the "Merger Agreement"),
among Pine, a Delaware corporation ("Pine"), Cedar, and Pine Merger Sub, a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cedar ("Merger Sub"), and
in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of
the registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement"), each as
amended or supplemented through the date hereof. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Pine (the "Merger"), with
Pine being the Surviving Corporation.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted. 

The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby represents on
behalf of Cedar as follows:

1\. The facts relating to the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, the
Registration Statement and the other documents described in the Registration
Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Cedar and its subsidiaries,
true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or
modification of any provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in the
Registration Statement. Other than those described or referenced in the Merger
Agreement and the Registration Statement, there are no agreements,
arrangements or understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a)
any of Cedar, its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of
Pine, its affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger
or otherwise. 2\. In the Merger, all shares of Pine stock will be exchanged solely for Cedar
Common Stock (except for, possibly, cash in lieu of fractional shares). For
purposes of this representation, shares of Pine stock redeemed or exchanged
for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Cedar
(including cash paid to dissenting shareholders) will be treated as
outstanding Pine stock at the Effective Time and as acquired by Cedar.

3\. Cedar Common Stock entitles the holder to vote for the election and the
removal of the board of directors of Cedar.

4\. The fair market value of Cedar stock (plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares) received by each Pine shareholder will be approximately
equal to the fair market value of Pine stock surrendered in the exchange, as
determined by arms-length negotiations between the respective managements of
Cedar and Pine. 

5\. Cash payments to be made to Pine shareholders in lieu of fractional shares
of Cedar stock that would otherwise be issued to such holders in the Merger
will be made solely for the purpose of saving Cedar the expense and
inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Cedar stock and
will not represent separately bargained for consideration. To the knowledge
of Cedar, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to
holders of Pine common stock in lieu of fractional shares of Cedar stock will
not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the
Merger to Pine shareholders.

6\. Cedar does not have any plan or intention to make any distributions after,
but in connection with, the Merger to holders of Cedar stock (other than
dividends made in the ordinary course of business).

7\. Neither Cedar nor any of its subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Cedar,
any of its affiliates, has any plan or intention to reacquire or redeem any of
its stock issued in the Merger, either directly or indirectly through any
transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person (including
by derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the
economic effect of an acquisition), except in connection with (i) any plan or
intention to purchase stock on the open market as part of a repurchase program
that satisfies the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58,1999-2 C.B. 701 (the
"Open Market Purchases") and (ii) an accelerated share repurchase (the "ASR")
whereby a securities brokerage or investment bank that is not related to Cedar
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (the "Broker/Bank") borrows
a specified number of Cedar Common Stock from stock lenders in the market and
sells such Cedar Common Stock to Cedar at an agreed price, and the
Broker/Bank subsequently purchases an equal number of Cedar Common Stock in
the open market, through a broker, at the prevailing market price, and returns
them to the stock lenders, provided that (a) the total  



 

2  number of shares of Cedar Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Open Market
Purchases and the ASR do not, in the aggregate, exceed the total number of
Cedar Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Merger, (b) the total
number of Cedar Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Open Market Purchases
and the ASR do not, in the aggregate, exceed the total number of shares of
Cedar Common Stock issued to Pine shareholders in the Merger, (c) neither the
Open Market Purchases nor the ASR were negotiated with Pine or the Pine
shareholders, (d) the purpose of the Open Market Purchases and the ASR is to
ameliorate the dilutive effect of Cedar issuing its shares in the Merger, (e)
Cedar and Pine shareholders had no understanding that the Pine shareholders
ownership of Cedar Common Stock would be transitory, (f) without regard to the
ASR and the Open Market Purchases, a market will exist for the newly-issued
Cedar Common Stock issued to the Pine shareholders in connection with the
Merger, and (g) during the time Cedar undertakes the ASR and the Open Market
Purchases, there will be sales of Cedar Common Stock on the open market,
which may include sales of Cedar Common Stock by former Pine shareholders. For
purposes of this representation, a person is considered to own or acquire
stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such
person is a partner in proportion to such persons interest in the
partnership.

8\. None of the Cedar stock (or cash in lieu of fractional shares) that will
be received by any Pine employee or independent contractor who is also a
shareholder of Pine in connection with the Merger represents separately
bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the performance of any
services. The compensation paid to any Pine employee or independent contractor
who is also a shareholder of Pine will be for services actually rendered (or
to be rendered) and has been or will be determined by bargaining at
arms-length. 

9\. Cedar and Merger Sub each will bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with or as part of the Merger or related transactions, and Cedar
will not bear any expenses of Pine or any of its shareholders. To the extent
that any transfer tax or other expense is a joint and several liability of a
Pine shareholder and Pine or Cedar, as the case may be, such liability shall
be paid by Pine if the Pine shareholder fails to pay the tax or expense, but
in no event shall such tax or expense be paid directly or indirectly by Cedar.

10\. At all times during Merger Subs existence, Cedar has directly owned all
of the stock of Merger Sub, and Cedar will continue to own all such stock
until the Merger. Merger Sub was formed solely to effectuate the Merger,
and (i) has not held and will not hold, at any time prior to the Merger, any
assets (other than cash contributed by Cedar upon incorporation) and (ii) has
not conducted, and will not conduct at any time prior to the Merger, any
business activities or other operations of any kind, other than any
activities in connection with the Merger.



 

3 11\. In the Merger, Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Pine and
will not transfer to Pine any assets subject to liabilities.

12\. Neither Cedar nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the
last five years, directly or indirectly, any stock of Pine or any instrument
giving the holder the right to acquire any such stock.

13\. Cedar will have "control" of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Merger. For purposes of this representation and representation 14,
"control" means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting
power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the
total number of shares of each other class of stock.

14\. Cedar has no plan or intention to, following the Merger, (i) cause or
allow the Surviving Corporation to issue additional shares of stock that would
result in Cedar losing control of the Surviving Corporation or (ii) take any
other action (including issuing any rights to acquire stock in the Surviving
Corporation) that could result in Cedar losing control of the Surviving
Corporation, except for transfers permitted by Section 368(a)(2)(C) or
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k). 

15\. Cedar has no plan or intention to (i) liquidate the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) merge the Surviving Corporation with or into another
corporation or other entity, (iii) otherwise dispose of the stock of the
Surviving Corporation, or (iv) cause Surviving Corporation to sell or
otherwise dispose of any of the assets of the Surviving Corporation acquired
in the Merger, except, in each case, for dispositions made in the ordinary
course of business or transfers permitted by Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(k).

16\. Following the Merger, Cedar will continue, or cause to be continued, the
"historic business" of Pine or use, or cause to be used, a significant
portion of Pines "historic business assets" in a business either directly or
through one or more members of Cedars qualified group (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) or one or more partnerships
in which Cedar and members of its qualified group own an aggregate interest
representing a significant interest in such business or have active and
substantial management functions as partners in such business (each within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)).

17\. After the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will hold (i) to the
knowledge of Cedar, at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net
assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets
held by Pine immediately prior to the Merger and (ii) at least 90 percent of
the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair
market value of the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Merger. For purposes of this representation, the following amounts will be
treated as assets of Pine or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately  



 

4  prior to the Merger: amounts (i) used (or to be used) by Pine or Merger Sub
to pay Merger expenses, (ii) paid (or to be paid) by Pine or Merger Sub to
holders of shares of Pine stock in lieu of fractional shares or pursuant to
the exercise of dissenters rights under applicable laws, (iii) paid (or to be
paid) by Pine or Merger Sub to redeem stock, securities, warrants, or options
of Pine as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, (iv) used
(or to be used) to repay debt, other than any debt that is refinanced in
connection with the Merger, and (v) distributed (or to be distributed) by Pine
or Merger Sub to the holders of Pine stock (except for regular, normal
dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither
Merger Sub nor, to the knowledge of Cedar, Pine has disposed of any assets
prior to the Merger which disposition was made in contemplation of, or as
part of, the Merger.

18\. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of Cedar
will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if
any, to which its assets are subject.

19\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Cedar or any of
its subsidiaries, on one hand, and Pine or any of its subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

20\. Neither Cedar nor Merger Sub is under the jurisdiction of a court in a
case under Title 11 of the United States Code, or a receivership,
foreclosure, or similar proceeding.

21\. Neither Cedar nor Merger Sub is an investment company within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

22\. To the knowledge of Cedar, the representations made in the representation
letter delivered by Pine to Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP and Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP and dated the date hereof are true, correct and complete in all
material respects.

23. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth
herein on behalf of Cedar, Merger Sub and their management.



 

5 The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinions will be based on the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the
representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents
related thereto, and (ii) your opinion will be subject to certain limitations
and qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if any such
representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of such covenants or
obligations are not satisfied in all material respects. The undersigned
further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinions, you may
consider each of the representations contained herein to be true, correct and
complete without regard to any knowledge qualification.

_Pine/Cedar Merger_

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

The undersigned, an officer of Pine, a Delaware corporation ("Pine"), has been
asked to make certain representations in connection with the opinions to be
delivered pursuant to Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of [ ], 2008 (the "Merger Agreement"), among
Pine, Cedar, a Louisiana corporation ("Cedar"), and Pine Merger Sub, a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cedar ("Merger Sub"), and
in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of
the registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement"), each
as amended or supplemented through the date hereof. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Pine (the "Merger"), with
Pine being the Surviving Corporation.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.

The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby represents on
behalf of Pine as follows:

1\. The facts relating to the Merger as described in the Merger
Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other documents described in
the Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Pine and its
subsidiaries, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger
will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver
or modification of any provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in
the Registration Statement. Other than those described or referenced in the
Merger Agreement and the Registration Statement, there are no agreements,
arrangements or understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a)
any of Cedar, its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of
Pine, its affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger
or otherwise.



 

7 2\. In the Merger, all shares of Pine stock will be exchanged solely for Cedar
voting stock, (except for, possibly, cash in lieu of fractional shares). For
purposes of this representation, shares of Pine stock redeemed or exchanged
for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Cedar
(including cash paid to dissenting shareholders) will be treated as
outstanding Pine stock at the Effective Time and as acquired by Cedar.

3\. The fair market value of Cedar stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares) received by each Pine shareholder will be approximately equal to the
fair market value of Pine stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by
arms-length negotiations between the respective managements of Cedar and
Pine.

4\. Cash payments to be made to Pine shareholders in lieu of fractional shares
of Cedar stock that would otherwise be issued to such holders in the Merger
will be made solely for the purpose of saving Cedar the expense and
inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Cedar stock and
will not represent separately bargained for consideration. To the
knowledge of Pine, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the
Merger to holders of Pine stock in lieu of fractional shares of Cedar stock
will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in
the Merger to Pine shareholders. 

5\. Pine has not made, and does not have any plan or intention to make, any
distributions prior to, in contemplation of or otherwise in connection with,
the Merger to holders of Pines stock (other than dividends made in the
ordinary course of business).

6\. Neither Pine nor any of its subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Pine,
any of its affiliates, has, either directly or indirectly through any
transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person (including by
derivative transactions, such as equity swaps, that would have the economic
effect of an acquisition), redeemed or acquired or has any plan or intention
to redeem or acquire any Pine Common Stock in contemplation of the Merger, or
otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. For purposes of
this representation and representation 7, a person is considered to own or
acquire stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which
such person is a partner in proportion to such persons interest in
the partnership.

7\. To the knowledge of Pine, there is no plan or intention by the
shareholders of Pine to sell or to otherwise transfer ownership to Cedar, or
any subsidiary or affiliate of Cedar, of any Cedar stock received in the
Merger, either directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or
arrangement with any other person (including by derivative transactions,
such as equity swaps, that would have the economic effect of an acquisition).



 

8 8\. None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any employee or
independent contractor of Pine who is also a shareholder of Pine represents
separate consideration for, or is allocable to, any of their Pine stock. None
of the Cedar stock (or cash in lieu of fractional shares) that will be
received by any Pine employee or independent contractor who is also a
shareholder of Pine in connection with the Merger represents separately
bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the performance of any
services. The compensation paid to any Pine employee or independent
contractor who is also a shareholder of Pine will be for services actually
rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be determined by bargaining
at arms-length.

9\. Pine has borne its own expenses incurred in connection with or as part of
the Merger or related transactions, and will not bear the expenses, if any, of
Cedar, Merger Sub or any stockholder. To the extent that any transfer tax or
other expense is a joint and several liability of a Pine shareholder and Pine
or Cedar, as the case may be, such liability shall be paid by Pine if the Pine
shareholder fails to pay the tax or expense, but in no event shall such
tax or expense be paid directly or indirectly by Cedar.

10\. At the Effective Time, Pine will not have outstanding any warrants,
options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which
any person could acquire stock in Pine that, if exercised or converted, would
affect Cedars acquisition or retention of "control" of the Surviving
Corporation. For this purpose, "control" means ownership of at least 80
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to
vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class
of stock.

11\. No assets of Pine have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of
that would prevent Cedar from satisfying the requirement that it
either continue the "historic business" of Pine or use a significant portion
of Pines "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as
such terms are defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)). 

12\. After the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will hold (i) at least 90
percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of
the fair market value of the gross assets held by Pine immediately prior to
the Merger and (ii) to the knowledge of Pine, at least 90 percent of the fair
market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market
value of the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger.
For purposes of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as
assets of Pine or Merger Sub, as applicable, held immediately prior to the
Merger: amounts (i) used (or to be used) by Pine or Merger Sub to pay Merger
expenses, (ii) paid (or to be paid) by Pine or Merger Sub to holders of shares
of Pine stock in lieu of fractional shares or pursuant to the exercise of
dissenters rights under applicable laws, (iii) paid (or to be paid) by Pine
or Merger Sub to redeem stock, securities, warrants, or options of Pine as
part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, (iv) used (or to be
used) to repay debt, other than any debt that is refinanced in connection
with the Merger, and (v) distributed (or to be distributed) by Pine or Merger
Sub to the holders of Pine stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as
part of any  



 

9  overall plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither Pine, nor to the
knowledge of Pine, Merger Sub, has disposed of any assets prior to the Merger
which disposition was made in contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger.

13\. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of Pine will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which its assets are subject.

14\. The liabilities of Pine and the liabilities to which the assets of Pine
are subject were incurred by Pine in the ordinary course of its business.

15. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Cedar or any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Pine or any of its subsidiaries, on the
other hand, that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

16\. Pine is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under Title 11 of
the United States Code, or a receivership, foreclosure, or
similar proceeding.

17\. Pine is not an investment company within the meaning of Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

18\. To the knowledge of Pine, the representations made in the representation
letter delivered by Cedar to Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP and Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP and dated the date hereof are true, correct and complete in all
material respects.

19\. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth
herein on behalf of Pine and its management.



 

10 The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinions will be based on the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the
representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents
related thereto, and (ii) your opinion will be subject to certain limitations
and qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if any such
representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of such covenants or
obligations are not satisfied in all material respects. The undersigned
further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinions, you may
consider each of the representations contained herein to be true, correct and
complete without regard to any knowledge qualification.
