Cedar, a Louisiana corporation (&#147;Cedar&#148;), has been asked to make certain representations in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2008 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), among Pine, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Pine&#148;), Cedar, and Pine Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned

Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Cedar and its subsidiaries, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of
any provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Registration Statement. Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement and the Registration Statement, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings, either
written or oral, between or among (a)&nbsp;any of Cedar, its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b)&nbsp;any of Pine, its affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger or otherwise. </FONT></P>

possibly, cash in lieu of fractional shares). For purposes of this representation, shares of Pine stock redeemed or exchanged for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Cedar (including cash paid to dissenting shareholders) will
be treated as outstanding Pine stock at the Effective Time and as acquired by Cedar. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">3. Cedar Common Stock entitles the holder to vote for

Cedar, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Pine common stock in lieu of fractional shares of Cedar stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Pine
shareholders. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">6. Cedar does not have any plan or intention to make any distributions after, but in connection with, the Merger to holders

opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], 2008 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), among Pine, Cedar,
a Louisiana corporation (&#147;Cedar&#148;), and Pine Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cedar (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), and in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the registration
statement on Form S-4 (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;), each as amended or supplemented through the date hereof. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Pine (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with Pine being the
Surviving Corporation. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. All
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The undersigned, after due inquiry and

the Registration Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Pine and its subsidiaries, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be consummated in
accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Registration Statement. Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement and the Registration
Statement, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a)&nbsp;any of Cedar, its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b)&nbsp;any of Pine, its affiliates or shareholders on the

be treated as outstanding Pine stock at the Effective Time and as acquired by Cedar. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">3. The fair market value of Cedar stock (plus cash in

and Pine. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">4. Cash payments to be made to Pine shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Cedar stock that would otherwise be issued to
such holders in the Merger will be made solely for the purpose of saving Cedar the expense and inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Cedar stock and will not represent separately bargained for consideration. To the knowledge
of Pine, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Pine stock in lieu of fractional shares of Cedar stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Pine shareholders.
