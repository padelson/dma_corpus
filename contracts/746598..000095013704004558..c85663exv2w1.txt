                         SALE AND PURCHASE OF SECURITIES

            2.1   Sale and Purchase of Securities. Upon the terms and subject to

U                                  ARTICLE III

                                  CONSIDERATION

            3.1   Consideration.

                                       10
<PAGE>

            (a)   The aggregate consideration for the Securities shall be an
amount in cash equal to one hundred and ninety million dollars ($190,000,000)
minus (i) the outstanding amount of the Company's and the LLC's debt for money
borrowed as set forth on Schedule 3.1(a) as of the Closing as reflected in pay
off letters delivered pursuant to Section 10.1(h)(x) hereof (the "Closing
Debt"), minus (ii) the amount of all Transaction Expenses (not paid prior to the
Closing Date by the LLC, Company or Selling Holders) plus (iii) the amount of
Cash (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.3.
Simultaneously with the Closing, Purchaser shall repay, or cause to be repaid,
on behalf of the Company and the LLC, the Closing Debt of the Company and the
LLC by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the Holder
Representative and, to the extent permitted by the holders of the Closing Debt,
cause all liens, security interests, mortgages, and other encumbrances securing
or supporting the Closing Debt to be released and terminated. Simultaneously
with the Closing, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of
Company, LLC and Selling Holders the Transaction Expenses to the extent not
either (x) paid prior to the Closing Date or (y) taken into account under clause
3.1(a)(ii) and deducted from the Purchase Price to the Persons and in the
amounts as directed by the Holder Representative.

            (b)   At the Closing the Purchaser shall deposit (i) a portion of
the Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) equal to one million five
hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) (the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") with a
bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the Holder
Representative (the "Escrow Agent") to be held in escrow (the "Adjustment Escrow
Account") pursuant to the terms and provisions of the escrow agreement attached
hereto as Exhibit B-1 (the "Adjustment Escrow Agreement") and (ii) a portion of
the Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) equal to ten million
dollars ($10,000,000.00) (the "Indemnity Escrow Amount") with the Escrow Agent
to be held in escrow (the "Indemnity Escrow Account") pursuant to the terms and
provisions of the escrow agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B-2 (the
"Indemnity Escrow Agreement"). Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of recovery for Purchaser
Indemnification Claims pursuant to Article XI. The Adjustment Escrow Agreement
shall provide that all amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be
released in connection with the payment described in Section 3.3(h) hereof. The
Indemnity Escrow Agreement shall provide that the remaining balance of the
Indemnity Escrow Account, less the amount of any Indemnification Claims then
outstanding, shall be released on September 30, 2005.

      3.2   Payment of Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay
an amount equal to the Closing Amount to the Selling Holders, which shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds into (i) the
account of Summit Ventures V, L.P. with respect to the aggregate amount payable
to all members of the Summit Group, (ii) Sunapee Securities, Inc. with respect
to the aggregate amount payable to the Bain Group, (iii) Jeffrey Steinwachs with
respect to the aggregate amount payable to all members of the Steinwachs Group
and (iv) the Company with respect to the aggregate amount payable to all members
of the Management Group. The Holder Representative shall deliver to Purchaser,
at least three (3) Business Days prior to

                                       11
<PAGE>

Closing, a letter of direction indicating the amount payable to each of the
Summit Group, the Bain Group, the Steinwachs Group and each member of the
Management Group as contemplated above and wire transfer instructions for each
such payment, as applicable.

            (a)   Each holder of issued and outstanding Class A Units of the LLC
shall receive with respect to each such Class A Unit held by it an amount equal
to the Class A Amount.

            (b)   Each Founding Stockholder who holds shares of Series A
Preferred Stock of the Company shall receive with respect to each such Series A
Preferred Share held by it an amount equal to the Series A Amount.

            (c)   Each holder of issued and outstanding Class B Units of the LLC
shall receive with respect to each such Class B Unit an amount equal to the
Class B Unit Price.

            (d)   Each Founding Stockholder who holds shares of Common Stock of
the Company shall receive, with respect to each such share of Common Stock, an
amount equal to the Common Share Price.

            (e)   Any additional payments to be made by the Purchaser to the
Selling Holders hereunder, whether pursuant to Section 3.3, the release of funds
held in the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnity Escrow Account or
otherwise, shall be paid pro rata among the holders of Class B Units and Common
Stock based upon the percentage of the Purchase Price received by such holders
by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds to the Summit
Group, Bain Group and Management Group as described in the first paragraph of
this Section 3.2.

            3.3   Purchase Price Adjustment.

            (a)   No less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser for Purchaser's review (i)
the Estimated Balance Sheet (as defined below) and (ii) a certificate of the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that the Estimated Balance
Sheet represents such person's good faith estimate of the Estimated Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Working Capital (each as defined below) based on the
books and records of the Company. The estimated balance sheet ("Estimated
Balance Sheet") shall present an estimate of the Working Capital as of the end
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, but after giving
effect to the benefit of any tax deductions arising from the payment by the
Company of the transaction bonuses set forth on Schedule 5.15(g) ("Estimated
Working Capital") and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 3.3(c) below.
The preparation of the Estimated Balance Sheet shall be for the sole purpose of
determining the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital differs from
fourteen million, two hundred thousand dollars ($14,200,000.00) (the "Target
Working Capital").

            (b)   For purposes of Closing, the Purchase Price will be adjusted
if the Estimated Working Capital differs from Target Working Capital. If the
Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, then the
Purchase Price will be

                                       12
<PAGE>

decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficiency. If the
Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, then the
Purchase Price will be increased on a dollar-for dollar basis by the amount of
such excess.

            (c)   As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered
to Holder Representative the Closing Statement (as defined below) and a
certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth the Purchaser's
calculation of Closing Working Capital. The closing statement (the "Closing
Statement") shall present the Working Capital as of the end of business on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, but after giving effect to the
benefit of any tax deductions arising from the payment by the Company of the
transaction bonuses set forth on Schedule 5.15(g) ("Closing Working Capital").
"Working Capital" means the current assets (excluding Cash) of the Company, plus
the net property, plant and equipment of the Company as shown on the January 31,
2004 Balance Sheet of the Company (less any depreciation and any property, plant
and equipment conveyed or otherwise disposed of since such date and plus any
capital expenditures since such date) reduced by the current liabilities
(excluding Closing Debt and accrued but unpaid interest and Transaction
Expenses) of the Company, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP and
the accounting principles set forth on Schedule 3.3(c) (the "Agreed
Principles"). The preparation of the Closing Statement shall be for the sole
purpose of determining the amount by which Closing Working Capital differs from
Estimated Working Capital. Attached hereto as Schedule 3.3(c)(i) is a schedule
showing Working Capital as of January 31, 2004. For purposes of the preparation
of the Closing Statement, the Purchaser shall conduct a physical count of the
Inventory consisting of one hundred percent (100%) of the raw material Inventory
and at least fifty percent (50%) by value of the other Inventory (starting with
the highest value items and working down), which count shall take place after
the Closing Date. The results of such count shall be adjusted (i.e., rolled
forward and rolled back) so as to be accurate as of the end of business on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Purchaser and Selling Holders shall
be permitted to have representatives participate in and/or observe such count.
Purchaser and Holder Representative shall use their reasonable efforts to
resolve any disputes regarding the count while it is being conducted.

            (d)   If Holder Representative disagrees with the Purchaser's
calculation of the Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(c),
the Holder Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, deliver a notice to the Purchaser disagreeing with such
calculation and setting forth Holder Representative's calculation of such
amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as
to which the Holder Representative disagrees, and the Holder Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to Section 3.3(c).

            (e)   If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant
to Section 3.3(d), the Holder Representative and Purchaser shall, during the
thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of

                                       13
<PAGE>

Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof
shown in the Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(c) nor
more than the amount thereof shown in Holder Representative's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(d). If during such period, the Holder
Representative and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause the New York city office of KPMG, LLP (the "Accounting
Referee") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in
making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an
expert to determine, based on the provisions of this Section 3.3, only those
items in dispute and shall not act as an arbitrator). The parties hereto
acknowledge and certify that the Accounting Referee is not the principal
independent auditor for the Purchaser, the Company, the LLC or Summit Partners,
L.P. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and the Purchaser's calculation
of Closing Working Capital as to which the Holder Representative has disagreed.
The Holder Representative and Purchaser shall execute a reasonable engagement
letter if requested by the Accounting Referee. Within ten (10) Business Days
after the Accounting Referee has been retained, each of the Holder
Representative and the Purchaser shall deliver to the Accounting Referee such
party's position with respect to each matter in dispute. Within five (5)
Business Days after the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, each
party may deliver to the Accounting Referee such party's response to the other
party's position on each matter in dispute. With each submission, each party may
also furnish to the Accounting Referee such other information and documents as
it deems relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by the
Accounting Referee with appropriate copies or notification being given to the
other party. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Holder Representative
and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty
(30) days from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report
setting forth the Accounting Referee's decision on each matter in dispute. Such
report shall be final and binding upon the Selling Holders and Purchaser. The
Closing Working Capital shall be finally calculated based on the report of the
Accounting Referee. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by
the Selling Holders, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand.

            (f)   The Selling Holders, Purchaser, the Company and the LLC shall,
and shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Working
Capital and in the conduct of the review referred to in this Section 3.3,
including, without limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of
books, records, work papers and personnel.

            (g)   If Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital,
Purchaser shall pay to the Selling Holders, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 3.3(h), the amount of such excess and, if Estimated Working
Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, the Selling Holders shall pay to
Purchaser in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 3.3(h). Any
payment made by either party pursuant to this Section 3.3(g) shall be deemed an
adjustment to the Class B Unit Price and the Common Share Price and shall be
allocated pro rata among the holders of Class B Units and Common Stock based
upon percentage of the Purchase Price received by such holders.

                                       14

<PAGE>

"Final Working Capital" means Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in the
Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(c) if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(d);
or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by the
Holder Representative and Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.3(e) or (B) in the
absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(e); provided, however, that in no event shall
Final Working Capital be more than the Holder Representative's calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(d) or less than
Purchaser's calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section
3.3(c).

            (h)   Any payment pursuant to Section 3.3(g) shall be made at a
mutually convenient time and place within five (5) Business Days after Final
Working Capital has been determined, by wire transfer by Purchaser or the
Selling Holders, as the case may be, of immediately available funds to the
account of such other party as may be designated in writing by such other party.
Any payment to be made hereunder by the Selling Holders shall be made first by
disbursement from the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to the provisions of
the Adjustment Escrow Agreement and thereafter, to the extent the Adjustment
Escrow Account is insufficient to make any payment required hereby, shall be
made by the holders of Class A Units and holders of Common Stock on a pro rata
basis based upon the proceeds received pursuant to this Agreement. With respect
to any such amount due and payable in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount the
members of each of the Summit Group, the Steinwachs Group and the Bain Group
shall be jointly and severally liable for the portion of such payments due by
the respective members of such group, but only severally liable with respect to
any other group. Each of the Summit Group, Steinwachs Group and Bain Group shall
be jointly and severally liable for any amounts due and owing with respect to
the Management Group. The Summit Group, Bain Group and Steinwachs Group shall be
liable for a portion of such payment due and owing from a Management Group
member equal to the product of (i) the aggregate proceeds received by all
members of such group divided by (ii) the aggregate proceeds received by all
members of each of the Summit Group, Bain Group and Steinwachs Group. The
Purchaser shall be required to seek, and shall take reasonable steps against any
member of the Management Group to collect the full amount of such excess payable
pursuant hereto, prior to seeking payment from any member of the Summit Group,
Steinwachs Group or Bain Group, it being agreed that Purchaser shall not be
required to commence litigation to collect any such amount from the Management
Group. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 3.3(h)
shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest published by
the Wall Street Journal as the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks on
the Closing Date. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment
to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of
three hundred sixty five (365) days and the actual number of days elapsed.

business on such date, provided that the terminating party is not in material
default of any of its obligations hereunder, and provided further that such date
shall be automatically extended for 75 days if only the conditions to Closing
set forth in Sections 10.1(d) and 10.2(d) remain unsatisfied or unwaived at May
15, 2004, it being acknowledged and understood that all conditions to Closing
set forth herein must still be satisfied or waived on or prior to the date to

            (b)   by mutual written consent of the Holder Representative and

Securities hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Purchaser or
the Selling Holders.

            4.4   Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Section 4.2, then each of the parties

or equity as may be available under applicable Law in the event of a breach by
the other party of the representations, warranties and covenants contained
herein and, provided, further, that the obligations of the parties set forth in
Article XII hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable
hereunder.

necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust
Laws that may be asserted by any Federal, state and local and non United States
antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible;
provided that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require either party
to commence or defend any litigation or adversarial proceeding or enter into or
agree to enter into any consent decree, hold separate order or trust or
otherwise agree to sell or dispose of any assets.

            9.5   Further Assurances.

            (b)   From time to time following the Closing, at the request of a
party hereto, and without further consideration, the other parties will execute

requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively
the transactions contemplated hereby.

            9.6   Confidentiality.

            (a)   Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is
subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between Purchaser, the
Company and the LLC dated October 21, 2003 as amended November 13, 2003,
February 5, 2004 and March 1, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon,
the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

            (b)   No Selling Holder shall, directly or indirectly, use or
disclose, or cause or allow to be used or disclosed, any secret, confidential,
or proprietary information of the Company or the LLC. The foregoing covenant
shall not apply to any secret, confidential or proprietary information which (i)
has been independently developed by others, or (ii) becomes generally known to
the public through no act or omission of a Selling Holder in violation of the
foregoing covenant. Selling Holders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
covenant is reasonable in scope and protects the legitimate business interests
of the Company, the LLC and the Purchaser.

            9.7   Indemnification.

            (a)   From and after the Closing Date, the Company and the LLC shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors, managers, officers or employees of the Company or the LLC
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them
in their capacities as such. Purchaser agrees that all rights of the Indemnitees
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the respective
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizational documents
of the Company or the LLC as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements
or arrangements of the Company or the LLC shall survive the Closing Date and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, such rights shall not be
amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In
addition, the Company and the LLC shall pay any reasonable expenses of any
Indemnitee under this Section 9.7, as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any breach of a representation or
warranty made by the Company, the LLC or a Selling Holder herein or any
indemnification obligation owing by any Selling Holder hereunder shall not be
deemed

                                       48
<PAGE>

for any reason to be a claim covered by indemnification or advancement of
expenses owing to such Indemnitee under this Agreement, any Law, certificate of
organization, bylaw or comparable document or other agreement whatsoever. In the
event the LLC is liquidated, dissolved or otherwise ceases to exist, the Company
shall assume all of the LLC's obligations hereunder.

            (b)   Each of Purchaser and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, and
cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any Claim and
shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

            (c)   For the six-year period commencing immediately after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain in effect, or cause the Company or LLC to
maintain in effect, each of the Company and the LLC's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing Date with respect to those persons who are currently covered by each of
the Company and the LLC's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on
terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Company
and the LLC's directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that Purchaser may
substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors
and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section
9.7(c); provided further that Purchaser shall only be required to pay an annual
premium up to 200% of the Company's annual premium in effect as of the Closing
Date; provided that the Selling Holders or their designees may pay any premium
in excess of such amount.

            (d)   The provisions of this Section 9.7: (i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

            (e)   In the event that within the six year period commencing
immediately after the Closing Date, Purchaser or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy required to
be maintained pursuant to Section 9.7(c) above is not terminated.

            (f)   The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 9.7 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 9.7 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee
(it being expressly

                                       49
<PAGE>

agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 9.7 applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 9.7).

            9.8   Preservation of Records. Following the Closing, the Company
shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to, preserve and keep the
records held by them relating to the respective businesses of the Company and
the LLC in accordance with the document retention policy of the Purchaser but in
no event for a period less than six (6) years from the Closing Date for records
relating to Taxes and ownership of the Company and the LLC and three (3) years
from the Closing Date for records relating to environmental matters and shall
make such records and personnel available to the other as may be reasonably
required by such party in connection with, among other things, any insurance
claims by, Legal Proceedings or tax audits against or governmental
investigations of the Selling Holders or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or

obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. The Selling Holder requesting such
access shall pay the reasonable direct out-of-pocket expenses of the Company
incurred in connection with this Section 9.8. Prior to Closing each Selling
Holder shall deliver to the Company all records or other property of or relating
to the Company or the LLC in such Selling Holder's control or possession and
shall promptly deliver to the Company all such records which come into its
control or possession after the Closing.

            9.9   Publicity.

            (a)   None of the Selling Holders, the Company, the LLC or Purchaser
shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, unless, in the judgment of the Selling Holders, the
Company, the LLC or Purchaser, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable
Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which the Selling
Holders, the Company, the LLC or Purchaser (or its Affiliate) lists securities,
provided that, to the extent required by applicable law, the party intending to
make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

            (b)   Each of Purchaser, the Company, the LLC and the Selling
Holders agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall not be disclosed or
otherwise made available to the public and that copies of this Agreement shall
not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the public, except where
such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law and only
to the extent required by such Law. In the event that such disclosure,
availability or filing is required by applicable Law, each of Purchaser, the
Company, the LLC and the Selling Holders (as applicable) agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "confidential treatment" of this
Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (or the equivalent
treatment by any other Governmental Body) and to redact such terms of this
Agreement as the other party shall request and as is permitted by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or other Governmental Body.

            (a)   Employees. Except with respect to employees employed at its
Palmetto, Florida facility, the Company shall continue to employ its employees
on substantially similar terms as those currently in place; provided, however
that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company after the Closing from
terminating the employment of any such employee or otherwise making personnel
decisions as the Company deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Such
individuals who continue their employment with the Company following the Closing
Date are hereinafter referred to as the "Continuing Employees." Purchaser and
Company acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be liable for any and all

connection with any violation of the WARN Act and other similar costs and
expenses associated with the layoff or termination of all or substantially all

prior to the Closing, the Company and the LLC shall each have the right to
supplement or amend the Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising
by written notice to Purchaser. No such supplement or amendment shall have any
effect on the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in Section
10.1(a). For purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and
warranties contained in this Article V, Article VI or Article VII hereof and the
liability of some or all of the Selling Holders under Article XI, the Schedules
shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the date
of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude any information contained in
any supplement or amendment thereto.

negotiation or agreement with respect to any such acquisition proposal, or (c)
furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or the LLC to any third
party (other than vendors, banks or any Governmental Body in the Ordinary Course

acquisition proposal or inquiry regarding the making of an acquisition proposal,
including any requests for information.

            9.13  Real Property.

            (a)   With respect to the Company Properties, Purchaser has
obtained, at its expense, title insurance commitments (the "Title Commitments")
issued by First American Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"), pursuant
to which the Title Company has agreed to issue to Purchaser a standard ALTA Form
B-1992 owner's policy or leasehold policy, as the case may be, of title
insurance, in an amount reasonably prescribed by Purchaser, insuring good and
marketable title to the owned Company Properties and valid leasehold interest in
the leased Company Properties. Purchaser has delivered complete and accurate
copies of the Title Commitments to counsel for the Selling Holders. The Company

shall provide to Purchaser original current surveys of the Company Properties,
certified to Purchaser and to the Title Company, prepared by registered
surveyors reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, which surveys shall be prepared
in accordance with the 1997 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM
Land Title Surveys (including all Table A Items except contours), and pursuant
to the accuracy standards of an Urban Class A Survey and shall be sufficient to
delete the standard title insurance policy exception for surveys, without adding
any new exceptions to the Title Commitments.

            (c)   Estoppel Certificates. For the Company Property located at
2491 Wehrle Drive, Williamsville, New York, the Company shall obtain Estoppel

                                       52

a retiree as described in Schedule 5.15(h) attached hereto to continue to
participate in such plan until the earlier of (a) the date on which the Company
ceases to offer such plan and (b) five (5) years from the Closing Date; provided
that the Purchaser and the Company shall give such persons 12 month's prior
written notice of such termination of the health insurance plan.

      and the LLC shall be able to pay their debts and obligations in the
      Ordinary Course of Business as they become due and (C) Purchaser, the
      Company and the LLC shall have adequate capital to carry on their
      businesses and all businesses in which they are about to engage; and

            (viii) All other documents, instruments or writings reasonably
      required to be delivered to the Holder Representative at or prior to the
      Closing pursuant to this Agreement and such other certificates of
      authority and documents as the Holder Representative may request to be
      delivered may reasonably request.

            10.3   Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, the
LLC, Purchaser or the Selling Holders may rely on the failure of any condition
set forth in Sections 10.1 or 10.2, as the case may be, if such failure was
caused by such party's failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            11.1   Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall
survive Closing and claims may be asserted with respect thereto to the extent
permitted by this Article XI.

            11.2   Indemnification by Selling Holders.

            (a)    Subject to Section 11.5 hereof, to induce Purchaser to enter
into this Agreement and to purchase the Securities, the Selling Holders hereby
agree, acting on a several and not joint basis (except as provided herein), to
indemnify and hold

                                       57
<PAGE>

Purchaser, the Company, the LLC, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Selling Holder Indemnified
Parties") harmless from and against:

            (i)   any and all losses, liabilities, obligations and damages
      (individually, a "Selling Holder Loss" and, collectively, "Selling Holder
      Losses") based upon or arising directly from (A) any breach of the
      representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Selling
      Holders or the Company in this Agreement or (B) any Selling Holder Losses
      arising directly from the transportation, treatment, storage, disposal or
      other handling of any Hazardous Materials at, or to, a site facility other
      than the Company's Palmetto, Florida facility;

            (ii)  any and all notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims,
      demands, assessments, judgments, costs, penalties and expenses, including
      reasonable attorneys' and other professionals' fees and disbursements
      (collectively, "Selling Holder Expenses") incident to any and all Losses
      with respect to which indemnification is provided hereunder.

            (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of the Bain Group,
Summit Group and Steinwachs Group shall be jointly and severally liable for the
indemnification obligations of members of their respective group.

            (c)   Each of the Summit Group, Bain Group and Steinwachs Group,
shall assume any indemnification obligation of a member of the Management Group
not paid by such member of the Management Group as provided herein. The Summit
Group, the Bain Group and the Steinwachs Group shall each be responsible for a
portion of such indemnification obligation equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate proceeds received by all members of such group divided by (ii) the
aggregate proceeds received by all the members of each of the Summit Group, Bain
Group and Steinwachs Group multiplied by the amount of such indemnification
claim. The Purchaser shall be required to seek, and shall take all reasonable
steps against any member of the Management Group to collect the full amount of
such indemnification obligation prior to seeking any payment from any member of
the Summit Group, Bain Group or the Steinwachs Group; provided, however, that
the Purchaser shall not be obligated to initiate litigation against any member
of the Management Group.

            (d)   Except as provided in Section 11.2(b) above, each Selling
Holder shall be liable only for its pro rata portion of any Selling Holder Loss
based upon a portion of the aggregate combined proceeds related to the Class B
Units and the Common Stock and in no event shall a Selling Holder be required to
make any indemnification payment in excess of the portion of the Purchase Price
received by such Selling Holder pursuant hereto.

            (e)   Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
except as provided in Section 11.2(b), no Selling Holder shall be held liable
for the breach by

                                       58
<PAGE>

any other Selling Holder of any representation, or warranty made by such Selling
Holder as to only itself.

            (f)   Purchaser shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to use
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Selling Holder Loss upon becoming aware of
any event which would give rise thereto.

            11.3  Indemnification by Purchaser.

            (a)   Subject to Section 11.5 hereof, Purchaser hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold the Selling Holders and their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against:

            (i)   any and all losses, liabilities, obligations and damages
      (individually, a "Purchaser Loss" and, collectively, "Purchaser Losses")
      based upon or arising directly from: (A) any breach of a representation or
      warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement and (B) any breach of a
      covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement; and

            (ii)  any and all notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims,
      demands, assessments, judgments, costs, penalties and expenses, including
      attorneys' and other professionals' fees and disbursements (collectively,
      "Purchaser Expenses") incident to any and all Purchaser Losses with
      respect to which indemnification is provided hereunder.

            (b)   The Selling Holders shall take and cause their Affiliates to
use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Purchaser Loss upon becoming aware of any
event which gives rise thereto.

            11.4  Indemnification Procedures. In the event that any Legal
Proceedings shall be instituted, or that any claim shall be asserted, by any
Person in respect of which payment may be sought under Sections 11.2, 11.3 or
11.4 hereof (an "Indemnification Claim"), the indemnified party shall promptly
cause written notice of the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it
has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
indemnifying party; provided, that the failure by the indemnified party to so
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from
liability to the indemnified party for any liability hereunder except to the
extent such failure shall have prejudiced the defense of the Indemnification
Claim. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Selling
Holder Losses or Purchaser Losses (individually an "EMED Loss" and together the
"EMED Losses") indemnified against hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification
Claim which relates to any EMED Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall
within fifteen (15) days (or sooner, if the nature of

                                       59
<PAGE>

the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its
intent to do so. The assumption of the defense of an Indemnification Claim by
the indemnifying party shall constitute an admission that such Indemnification
Claim is indemnifiable by the indemnifying party hereunder. If the indemnifying
party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any EMED Losses indemnified against
hereunder or if the indemnifying party does not defend against the
Indemnification Claim with reasonable diligence and in good faith, the
indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense
of any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or
its own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; provided,
however, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if
(i) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate, (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that
would make such separate representation advisable or (iii) the Indemnification
Claim seeks injunctive or other relief which, if granted, could materially and
adversely affect the indemnified party or its Affiliates; and provided, further,
that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such
separate counsel and one local counsel for all indemnified parties in connection
with any Indemnification Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with
each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
Indemnification Claim and to keep the other party reasonably informed of all
material developments on any Indemnification Claim which such party is
defending. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.4 to the contrary,
neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the
written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification
Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the
claimant and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from
all liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim; provided, that in the
event the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to EMED Losses or if
the indemnifying party does not defend against the Indemnification Claim with
reasonable diligence and in good faith as described above, the indemnified party
shall be free to settle or compromise the Indemnification Claim on such terms
and conditions as are acceptable to the indemnified party and the indemnified
party shall be indemnified for the EMED Losses relating thereto, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 11.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party
claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing
of the indemnifying party's willingness to accept the settlement offer and,
subject to the applicable limitations of Section 11.5, pay the amount called for
by such offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of
any participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party
has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the
amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept
plus the Losses of the indemnified party relating to such Indemnification Claim
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or

                                       60
<PAGE>

(B) the aggregate EMED Losses of the indemnified party, with respect to such
Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any
insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such
Indemnification Claim.

            11.5  Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations
and Warranties.

            (a)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser
must give notice to the Holder Representative, and Holder Representative must
give notice to Purchaser, of any Indemnification Claim relating to a breach of a
representation or warranty in writing in reasonable detail prior to September
30, 2005; provided, however, that Indemnification Claims relating to Section
5.19 and Section 11.2(a)(i)(B) hereof may be made prior to the third anniversary
of the Closing and, provided, further, however, that Indemnification Claims
relating to Sections 5.2, 5.4, 5.10, 5.20, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7(a), 6.7(i), 6.8,
7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 8.2, 8.6 or 8.8 hereof may be made prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to such matter. Any
Indemnification Claim relating to a breach of a representation or warranty made
prior to or on the applicable dates set forth above in this Section 11.5 shall
survive until resolved in accordance with the terms hereof. Any Indemnification
Claim relating to a breach of a representation and warranty not made by on or
prior to the applicable dates set forth above in this Section 11.5 will be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

            (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XI, the Selling
Holders shall not have any indemnification obligations for EMED Losses under
Section 11.2(a)(i)(A) for breaches of representations and warranties or under
Section 11.2(a)(i)(B), unless the aggregate amount of all such EMED Losses
exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000), and then only to the extent of such
excess; provided however that such limitation shall not apply to any breach of a
representation contained in Sections 5.2, 5.4, 5.10, 5.20, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6,
6.7(a), 6.7(b), 6.7(c), 6.7(i), 6.8, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.6. The maximum aggregate
indemnification to be paid by the Selling Holders under Section 11.2(a)(i)(A)
for breaches of representations and warranties and under Section 11.2(a)(i)(B)
shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount; provided, however, that such
limitation shall not apply to any breach of a representation contained in
Sections 5.2, 5.4, 5.10, 5.20, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7(a), 6.7(b), 6.7(c), 6.7(i),
6.8, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.6, for which the maximum amount payable with respect to any
breach of the representation and warranty contained in Section 5.10 and Section
6.8 shall, in the aggregate, be thirty million dollars ($30,000,000), less any
amounts paid to the Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow Amount in respect of
claims as provided above, and with respect to each other excluded representation
the maximum amount payable shall be the proceeds received by the Selling Holders
hereunder less any amount previously paid to the Purchaser from the Indemnity
Escrow Account.

            (c)   No representation or warranty of the Company or the Selling
Holders contained herein shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and the Company or
the Selling Holders shall not be deemed to have breached a representation or
warranty, as a

                                       61
<PAGE>

consequence of the existence of any fact, circumstance or event which is
disclosed in one Schedule to this Agreement as long as such fact, circumstance
or event is disclosed on another Schedule and the disclosure on one Schedule
applies to another Schedule in the Purchaser's reasonable determination.

            (d)   Purchaser shall not make any claim for indemnification under
this Article XI in respect of any matter that is taken into account in the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.3(g).

            (e)   Any indemnification amounts payable under this Article XI
shall be calculated after giving effect to the actual realized tax benefits or
tax losses and insurance recovery to the parties resulting from the damage,
loss, liability or expense that is the subject of the indemnity; provided, that
such indemnified party is not subject to retroactive adjustments or other
reimbursements of its insurance in respect of such proceeds; provided, further,
that the pendency of such payments shall not delay or reduce the obligation of
the indemnifying party to make indemnification payments hereunder and if
insurance proceeds are subsequently received by the indemnified party such
proceeds shall be promptly paid over to the indemnifying party to the extent of
any indemnification payments made.

            (f)   Any indemnification obligation of the Selling Holders
hereunder which: (i) exceeds the Indemnity Escrow Amount or (ii) is asserted
after the Indemnity Escrow Amount has been released, and in either case is still
a valid claim for indemnification hereunder, shall be the responsibility of by
the Selling Holders themselves, subject to each of the other subparagraphs of
this Article XI.

            11.6  Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Selling Holders and
Purchaser agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article XI
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income tax purposes.

            11.7  No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to
any other Person for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or
punitive damages of such other Person, including diminution of value or loss of
business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach
hereof (provided that such limitation shall not limit the Purchaser's right to
recover for loss of revenue, loss of profit and other Selling Holder Losses
relating to the business operated by the Company arising from or related to any
such breach or alleged breach or to Selling Holders' right to recover contract
damages in connection with Purchaser's failure to close in violation of this
Agreement).

            11.8  Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy,
of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any covenant or agreement
to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, other than the covenant set
forth in Section 2.1 hereof, shall be indemnification in accordance with this
Article XI. Except as provided in Section 11.5(b) and 11.5(f), any
indemnification payable by the Selling Holders shall be satisfied by
distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Account. In furtherance of the

                                       62
<PAGE>

foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including
rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which
exist or may arise in the future, relating to breaches or inaccuracies of
representations or warranties, that they may have against the Selling Holders or
Purchaser, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state or
local Law (including any such Law relating to environmental matters or arising
under or based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            12.1  Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes. All sales, use,
transfer, intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or
charges, of any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Purchaser.

            12.2  Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
of the Selling Holders and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Selling
Holders shall be responsible for all Transaction Expenses and, to the extent any
Transaction Expenses are not satisfied at Closing pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
above or deducted in determining the Purchase Price under Section 3.1(a), the
Selling Holders shall pay all such Transaction Expenses when due.

            12.3  Holder Representative.

            (a)   Each Selling Holder hereby irrevocably appoints Summit
Partners, L.P. (the "Holder Representative") as such Selling Holder's
representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution to
act in the name, place and stead of such Selling Holder with respect to the
transfer of such Selling Holder's Company Stock and LLC Units, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to act on behalf
of such Selling Holder in any amendment of or litigation or arbitration
involving this Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts
and things, and to execute all such documents, as such Holder Representative
shall deem necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the power:

            (i)   to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with
      the waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Selling Holders to
      consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

            (ii)  to negotiate, execute, deliver and receive all ancillary
      agreements, statements, certificates, notices, approvals, extensions,
      waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents required or
      permitted to be given in connection

                                       63
<PAGE>

      with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
      (it being understood that such Selling Holder shall execute and deliver
      any such documents which the Holder Representative agrees to execute);

            (iii) to terminate this Agreement if the Selling Holders are
      entitled to do so;

            (iv)  to give and receive all notices and communications to be given
      or received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in
      connection with the any claims under this Agreement, including service of
      process in connection with arbitration; and

            (v)   to negotiate the settlement of any disputes, as contemplated
      and in the manner set forth herein; and

            (vi)  to take all actions which under this Agreement may be taken by
      the Selling Holders and to do or refrain from doing any further act or
      deed on behalf of the Selling Holders which the Holder Representative
      deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating to the
      subject matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as such Selling
      Holder could do if personally present.

            (b)   The Holder Representative will not be liable for any act taken
or omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement, except if such act is taken
or omitted in bad faith, gross negligence or by willful misconduct. The Holder
Representative will also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice,
demand, certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine
(including facsimiles thereof).

            (c)   The Selling Holders agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify
the Holder Representative for, and to hold the Holder Representative harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct,
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative, arising
out of or in connection with the Holder Representative's carrying out it duties
under this Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully defending
Holder Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto. The
Holder Representative may consult with counsel of its own choice and will have
full and complete authorization and protection for any action taken and suffered
by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

            (d)   The Holder Representative shall not compromise or settle any
claim or amount which disproportionately affects the interests of any Selling
Holder in relation to all Selling Holders, without the prior written consent of
the Selling Holder so affected.

            Purchaser shall be fully protected in dealing with the Holder
Representative under this Agreement and may rely upon the authority of the
Holder Representative to act as the Selling Holders' agent under this Agreement.
Any payments or deliveries (including without limitation notices required or
permitted hereunder) by Purchaser to the Holder Representative under this
Agreement for the benefit of the

                                       64
<PAGE>

Selling Holders, or any of them, shall be considered payments or deliveries made
by Purchaser to the Selling Holders.

            If Summit Partners, L.P. becomes unable to serve as Holder
Representative, Jeffrey Steinwachs, or such other Person or Persons as may be
designated by a majority of the Selling Holders, shall succeed as the Holder
Representative. The Holder Representative shall provide to Jeffrey Steinwachs a
full and complete copy of each item of correspondence between the Holder
Representative and the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's representatives.

            12.4  Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

            (a)   The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the
State of Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, or action
proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The
parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

            (b)   Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being
served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.7.

            12.5  Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement
(including the schedules and exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written
instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without
limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such
right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

            12.8  Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

            12.9  Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create
any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this
Agreement except as contemplated by Section 9.7. No assignment of this Agreement
or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either Company, LLC,
Selling Holders or Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided,
that Purchaser shall be permitted at any time to, and following the Closing,
Company and LLC shall be permitted to, assign to an Affiliate of Purchaser all
or any portion of their respective rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment of any
obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations.
Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to
Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise
requires.

            12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and

                                       67

all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement. Facsimile copies of signatures shall constitute valid and binding
obligations of the signing party once delivered to the other parties.

            12.11 Specific Performance. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT, PRIOR TO
CLOSING, IRREPARABLE DAMAGE WOULD OCCUR IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE PROVISIONS
OF THIS AGREEMENT WERE NOT PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR SPECIFIC TERMS OR
WERE OTHERWISE BREACHED. IT IS ACCORDINGLY AGREED THAT THE PARTIES SHALL BE
ENTITLED TO AN INJUNCTION OR INJUNCTIONS TO PREVENT BREACHES OF THIS AGREEMENT
AND TO ENFORCE SPECIFICALLY THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS HEREOF IN ANY COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE HAVING JURISDICTION, THIS BEING IN ADDITION TO ANY
OTHER REMEDY TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED AT LAW OR IN EQUITY.
