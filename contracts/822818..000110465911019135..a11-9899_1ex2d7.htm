delivering to Parent the Disclosure Letter required to be delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, which is deemed to constitute an integral part of this
Agreement and to modify or supplement, as applicable, the representations and
warranties of Peak contained in this Agreement. Peak will not be in breach of
this Agreement as a result of a representation or warranty being inaccurate or
incomplete if, by virtue of any disclosure in any part of the Disclosure

included or being reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure, or of
this Agreement, the true facts with respect to the representation or warranty
have been disclosed in the Disclosure Letter. Peak represents and warrants to
and in favour of Parent and Purchaser as follows and acknowledges that Parent
and Purchaser are relying upon such representations and warranties in
connection with entering into this Agreement:

 



 

(a) _Board Approval_. As of the date hereof, the Board, after consultation

Arrangement is fair to the Peak Shareholders and is in the best interests of

creation and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to own
its assets as now owned and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Peak and each of its Subsidiaries is duly registered or otherwise
authorized to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the character of its properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held, or
the nature of its activities, makes such registration necessary, except where
the failure to be so registered or in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Peak Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially delay the Arrangement. Correct, current and
complete copies of the articles of incorporation, continuance or amalgamation
and by-laws (or the equivalent organizational documents), each as amended to
date, of Peak and each of its Subsidiaries listed in Section 3.1(g) of the
Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " **Peak Organizational Documents** ")

power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its

delivery by it of this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
subject, in the case of completion of the Arrangement, to the receipt of the
Required Vote and approval by the Court. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Peak and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Peak enforceable against Peak in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific
performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered.

 



 

(d) _No Violations_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Peak, nor the consummation of the Arrangement by Peak, nor compliance by Peak
with any of the provisions hereof will:

 



 

(i) subject to payment of the Indebtedness of Peak to be outstanding on the
Closing Date under the Peak Amended and Restated Credit Agreements in
accordance with the payoff letters or other written confirmations described in
Section 6.2(f) and except where it would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Peak Material Adverse Effect,
violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, require any
consent, approval or notice under, or constitute a default (or an event which
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)

Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (A) the
respective charters or

 



      
 

 



 

by-laws or other comparable organizational documents of Peak and its
Subsidiaries or (B) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, loan agreement, deed
of trust, Lien, or other Contract to which Peak or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or to which Peak or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties or assets may be subject or by which Peak or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound; or

 



 

(ii) subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals and the Required Vote and
compliance with the Interim Order and any approvals required thereunder, the
Final Order and filings with the Registrar and compliance with any applicable

or warranties made by Peak in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by
Peak pursuant to this Agreement. Parent or Purchaser shall promptly notify

anything that causes any of the representations or warranties of Peak set out
in this Agreement to become materially untrue or inaccurate; or (ii) any
material breach of any covenant, term or condition of Peak set out in this
Agreement. The representations and warranties of Peak contained in this

and be terminated on the earlier of the Effective Time and the date on which
this Agreement is

 



      
 

 



 

terminated in accordance with its terms. This Section 3.2 will not limit any

 **ARTICLE IV.**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT**

 



 

 **Section 4.1. _Representations and Warranties of Parent_**

 



 

Parent hereby represents and warrants to and in favour of Peak as follows and
acknowledges that Peak is relying upon such representations and warranties in
connection with entering into this Agreement:

 



 

(a) _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a
corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own its assets as now owned and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of Parent and Purchaser is duly registered or
otherwise authorized to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties, owned, leased, licensed
or otherwise held, or the nature of its activities makes such registration
necessary, except where the failure to be so registered or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the Arrangement.

 



 

(b) _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Parent and Purchaser has
the requisite corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry
out its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation by each of Parent and Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by their
respective boards of directors, and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of either Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery by it of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Purchaser and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of creditors
and that equitable remedies, including specific performance, are discretionary
and may not be ordered.

 



 

(c) _No Violations_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser, nor the consummation of the Arrangement by Parent and
Purchaser, nor compliance by Parent and Purchaser with any of the provisions
hereof will:

 



 

(i) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any material provision
of, require any consent, approval or notice under, or constitute a default (or
an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under (A) the articles of incorporation or by-laws governing Parent
or Purchaser or (B) any material contract or other instrument or obligation to
which Parent or Purchaser is a party or to which any of them, or any

 



      
 

 



 

of their respective properties or assets, may be subject or by which Parent or
Purchaser is bound and, in each case, individually or in the aggregate would
materially adversely affect ParentÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s ability to perform its
respective obligations under this Agreement, or subject to obtaining the
Regulatory Approvals, violate any Law applicable to Parent or Purchaser or any
of their respective properties or assets; or

 



 

(ii) subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals and, assuming compliance
with the Interim Order and any approvals required thereunder, the Final Order,
and filings with the Registrar and compliance with applicable Securities Laws,
violate in any material respect any Law applicable to Parent or Purchaser or
any of their respective properties and assets.

 



 

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_. Other than filings, notices and/or
approvals under (i) the Securities Laws, (ii) the Competition Act, (iii) and
the antitrust and/or notification laws of any other jurisdiction, where
required, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by
Parent or Purchaser with, and no consents, registrations, approvals, permits
or authorizations are required to be obtained by Parent or Purchaser from, any
Governmental Entity, in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Purchaser and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, except
where the failure to make any such notice, report or filing or obtain any such
consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement.

 



 

(e) _Financing._ Parent has financing sufficient to ensure that Purchaser will
have available the required funds to consummate the Arrangement at the
Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Peak
Circular will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments or
supplements contemplated thereby), at the date the Peak Circular is first
mailed to the Peak Shareholders, at the time of the Peak Meeting or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, as amended or supplemented at
such date or time, contain any misrepresentation or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are made.

 



 

(g) _Ownership of Purchaser._ Parent indirectly owns all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Purchaser.

 



 

(h) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor any of its officers, directors
or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for
any brokerage fees, commissions or finderÂ’s fees in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 4.2. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_**

 



 

No investigation by or on behalf of, or knowledge of, Peak or any of its
Affiliates will mitigate, diminish or affect the representations or warranties
made by Parent and Purchaser in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement. Peak shall promptly notify Parent if, at
any time before the Closing Date, it becomes aware of: (i) anything that
causes any of the representations or warranties of Parent set out in this
Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate; or (ii) any material breach
of any covenant, term or condition of Parent or Purchaser set out in this
Agreement. The representations and warranties of Parent contained in this
Agreement will expire and be terminated on the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms. This Section 4.2 will not limit any covenant or agreement of Parent or
Purchaser which, by its terms, contemplates performance after the Effective
Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated, as the case may be.

Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) Other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, Peak will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make

 **Section 5.2. _Pre-Acquisition Transactions_**

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(d), prior to the Effective Time,
Peak agrees to (i) at ParentÂ’s expense, cooperate with and provide reasonable
assistance to Parent in connection with ParentÂ’s planning for and
implementation of any such reorganizations of the business, operations, assets
or corporate structure of Peak and its Subsidiaries as Parent may request,
acting reasonably (each a " **Pre-Acquisition Transaction** "), and (ii) at
ParentÂ’s expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to implement in advance
of the Effective Time any Pre-Acquisition Transaction as reasonably requested
by Parent. At ParentÂ’s option, such Pre-Acquisition Transactions may include,
without limitation, (i) formation of new Peak Subsidiaries, (ii) merger,
amalgamation or consolidation of existing Peak Subsidiaries, (iii) transfer of
securities in, or assets held by, existing Peak Subsidiaries either by sale,
dividend or contribution, and (iv) filing of any elections required or
permitted under applicable Tax Laws relating to such transactions.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(d), to the extent that a Pre-
Acquisition Transaction requires approval of the Peak Shareholders under the
ABCA, Peak shall at ParentÂ’s expense, (i) seek approval of the Peak
Shareholders for such Pre-Acquisition Transaction at the Peak Meeting, (ii)
include in the Peak Circular a form of special resolution of the Peak
Shareholders (the " **Transaction Resolution** ") approving such Pre-
Acquisition Transaction in form and substance acceptable to Parent, acting
reasonably, either included within the Arrangement Resolution or separate from
the Arrangement Resolution if so requested by Parent, and (iii) include in the
Peak Circular the unanimous recommendation of the Board that the Peak
Shareholders vote in favour of the Transaction Resolution, provided

 



       
 

 



 

that Parent and Purchaser agree to amend the provisions of this Agreement
requiring Peak to take certain action by specified times, including such
provisions contained in Sections 2.1 and 2.3, to the extent necessary to
facilitate the foregoing. Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.2, the
provisions in Article II regarding PeakÂ’s obligations respecting the approval
of the Arrangement Resolution shall, save and except for the last sentence of
Section 2.5, apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the approval of the Transaction
Resolution.

 



 

(c) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(b) and 5.2(d), the
Parties will work cooperatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare prior to the Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such
other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to any Pre-Acquisition
Transactions. Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(b) and 5.2(d),
the Parties shall give effect to any Pre-Acquisition Transactions immediately
before the Effective Time and shall seek to have them become effective
immediately before the Effective Time (but after Parent shall have confirmed
that all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied or waived by
Parent and Peak shall have confirmed that all conditions in Sections 6.1 and
6.3 have been satisfied or waived by Peak). In no event shall completion of
any Pre-Acquisition Transaction be a condition to completion of the
Arrangement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Peak shall not be required to take any
action with respect to a Pre-Acquisition Transaction unless it determines to
its satisfaction, acting reasonably, that: (A) such implementation will not
delay or prevent consummation of the Arrangement (including by giving rise to
litigation by third parties); (B) such implementation will not have an adverse
impact on the Peak Shareholders; (C) such implementation will not have an
adverse impact on Peak should the Arrangement not be consummated for any
reason; (D) the Arrangement will be consummated and the Effective Time will
occur immediately following the completion of such Pre-Acquisition
Transaction; (E) any proposed Pre-Acquisition Transaction shall not require
Peak to contravene any Laws, its organizational documents or any Contract
material to Peak and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and (F) Peak and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and representatives shall have received an indemnity, in form and
substance satisfactory to Peak, acting reasonably, from Parent from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with or as a result of any Pre-Acquisition Transaction. The
determination as to whether the conditions set out in (A) to (F) have or will
be satisfied shall be solely that of Peak, acting reasonably.

 



 

(e) Parent agrees that the planning for and implementation of any Pre-
Acquisition Transaction at ParentÂ’s request in advance of the Effective Time
will not be considered a breach of any covenant under this Agreement and will
not be considered in determining whether a representation or warranty of Peak
under this Agreement has been breached. For greater certainty, Peak shall not
be liable for any failure to properly implement any Pre-Acquisition
Transaction or for the failure of Parent or Purchaser to benefit from any
anticipated tax efficiency.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.3.** ** ****_Covenants of Peak Regarding the Arrangement_**

 



 

Peak will perform, and will cause its Subsidiaries to perform, all obligations
required or desirable to be performed by Peak or any of its Subsidiaries under
this Agreement, co-operate with Parent and Purchaser in connection therewith,
and do all such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable in
order to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Peak will and, where appropriate, will cause its
Subsidiaries to:

 



 

(a) except as specifically permitted by Section 7.2, use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Vote;

 



 

(b) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.2,
submit the Arrangement to the Peak Shareholders at the Peak Meeting even if
the Board has withdrawn, amended, modified or qualified its recommendation of
the Arrangement;

 



 

(c) use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals required to be obtained by Peak or a Subsidiary in
connection with the Arrangement from other parties to the Contracts and, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, not pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, or
make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person
for such approval or consent, and (ii) not request of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to pay or commit to pay to any Person (other than a Governmental
Entity) whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, or make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation to such Person for such approval or consent;

 



 

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect all necessary
registrations, filings and submissions of information required by Governmental
Entities from Peak or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Arrangement;

 



 

(e) apply for and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
Regulatory Approvals relating to Peak or any of its Subsidiaries which are
typically applied for by a Person being acquired and, in doing so, keep Parent
reasonably informed as to the status of the proceedings related to obtaining
the Regulatory Approvals, including providing Parent with copies of all
related applications and notifications (other than confidential information
contained in such applications and notifications), in draft form, in order for
Parent to provide its comments thereon; provided, however, that nothing in
this Agreement shall require Peak or its Affiliates to divest or hold separate
or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to any asset,
property or agreement of Peak or any of its Subsidiaries in order to obtain
any such Regulatory Approval;

 



 

(f) use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend all lawsuits or other
legal, regulatory or other proceedings against Peak or any of its Subsidiaries
challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby;

 



      
 

 



 

(g) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, upon request by Parent,
furnish Parent with all information concerning (i) itself and its Subsidiaries
(including information concerning their respective businesses, operations,
markets, customers, suppliers and others they have business relations with)
and (ii) historical and pro forma financial statements, in connection with
ParentÂ’s financing (including syndication efforts) for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided that in no event shall the
Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) of Peak
be disclosed (except as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement) to any
Person without the prior written consent of Peak. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent agrees that Peak will not be liable for any failure of
Parent or Purchaser to obtain financing for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

 



 

(h) abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.4.** ** ****_Covenants of Parent_**

 



 

Parent will perform, and will cause Purchaser to perform, all obligations
required or desirable to be performed by it under this Agreement, co-operate

(a) apply for and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
Regulatory Approvals relating to it and relating to Peak or any of PeakÂ’s
Subsidiaries which are typically applied for by an acquiror (including those
referenced in Schedule C) and, in doing so, keep Peak reasonably informed as
to the status of the proceedings related to obtaining the Regulatory
Approvals, including providing Peak with copies of all related applications
and notifications in draft form (other than confidential information contained
in such applications and notifications), in order for Peak to provide its
reasonable comments thereon; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement

Peak and its Subsidiaries credit under the relevant Parent Plans for the
period of their employment by Predecessor, Peak or their Subsidiaries and
permit them to participate in ParentÂ’s employee stock purchase plan if they
wish to do so. PeakÂ’s continuing management employees will also be entitled to
participate in a cash bonus arrangement similar to ParentÂ’s management
incentive plan (" **MIP** ") on terms similar to comparable management
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, provided that separate EBITDA goals
for Peak will be established based on the PeakÂ’s performance during the stub
period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2011.

 



 

 **Section 5.5.** ** ****_Mutual Covenants_**

 



 

Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated in this
Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Effective Time and the time that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms:

 



 

(a) it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of) the conditions precedent to
its obligations hereunder as set forth in Article VI to the extent the same is
within its control and to take, or cause to be taken, all other action and to
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable under
all applicable Laws to consummate the Arrangement, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) oppose, lift or rescind any injunction
or restraining order against it or other order or action against it seeking to
stop, or otherwise adversely affecting its ability to make and complete, the
Arrangement; and (ii) co-operate with the other Parties in connection with the
performance by it and its Subsidiaries of their obligations hereunder and

 



 

(b) it will not (i) take any action, (ii) refrain from taking any commercially
reasonable action, or (iii) permit any action to be taken or any commercially
reasonable action to not be taken, which is inconsistent with this Agreement
or which would reasonably be expected to significantly impede the consummation
of the Arrangement or to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except for representations
and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which will be

will be discharged and such Agreements will terminate; and

 



 

(g) if the Court shall have required that Peak provide to the Peak
Shareholders dissent rights in connection with the Arrangement, the aggregate

Shareholders purporting to exercise dissent rights in connection with the
Arrangement does not exceed five percent (5.0%) of the total outstanding Peak
Common Shares.

 



 

 **Section 6.3.** ** ****_Additional Conditions Precedent to the Obligations
of Peak_**

 



 

The obligations of Peak to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any Pre-Acquisition Transactions referred to in Section

is for the exclusive benefit of Peak and may be waived by Peak):

and Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Arrangement, and Peak will have received a certificate of Parent and
Purchaser, addressed to Peak and dated the Closing Date, signed on behalf of

 **ARTICLE VII. 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

 **Section 7.1.** ** ****_Notice Provisions_**

 



 

(a) Each of Peak and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time
of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be
likely to:

 



 

(i) cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof
or at the Effective Time; or

 



 

(ii) result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Each of Peak and Parent will promptly notify the other Party of (i) any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from such Party, its
Subsidiaries or its representatives), (ii) any material communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from such Party, its Subsidiaries or its
representatives), and (iii) any material Legal Actions threatened or commenced
against or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that are
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.2.** ** ****_Non-Solicitation_**

 



 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Article VII, Peak will not, directly
or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative
(including any financial or other advisor) or agent of Peak or any of its
Subsidiaries, take any action of any kind which might, directly or indirectly,
interfere with the successful completion of the Arrangement, including any
action to (i) solicit, assist, initiate, knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing or providing access to any information or
permitting any visit to any facilities or properties of Peak or any of its
Subsidiaries, or entering into any form of Contract) the initiation of any
inquiries, proposals or offers regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
Parent or Purchaser and their Affiliates and advisors) regarding an actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal, (iii)

 



      
 

 



 

accept, approve, endorse or recommend or remain neutral with respect to, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend or remain neutral with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) accept or enter into, or
publicly propose to accept or enter into, any Contract in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
Section 7.2(d)).

 



 

(b) Peak will, and will cause the officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents of Peak and its Subsidiaries to, immediately
terminate any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent or Purchaser and their Affiliates and advisors) that
has made, indicated any interest to make or may reasonably be expected to
make, an Acquisition Proposal and will cease to provide to any such Person any
information or access to any information, concerning Peak or any of its
Subsidiaries. Peak agrees not to release any third party from, waive any
provision of, forebear in the enforcement of, or terminate any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which it is a party. Peak will promptly
request the return or destruction of all information provided to any third
party which, at any time since January 1, 2009, has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Predecessor or Peak relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal to the extent that such information has not previously
been returned or destroyed, and will use all commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that such requests are honoured in accordance with the terms of such
agreement. For greater certainty, Peak will not permit any Person other than
Parent, Purchaser and their lenders and advisors to access any virtual data
room established except as permitted under Section 7.2(d)(D).

 



 

(c) Peak will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt by Peak)
notify Parent, at first orally and thereafter in writing, of any proposal,
inquiry, offer (or any amendment thereto) or request relating to or
constituting an Acquisition Proposal, or that could be reasonably expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case received after the date hereof,
of which any of its directors, officers, representatives or agents are or
become aware, or any amendments to the foregoing, any request for discussions
or negotiations, any request for representation on the Board, or any request
for non-public information relating to Peak or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books
or records of Peak or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that informs Peak
or such Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal or any amendment thereto; and Peak will promptly provide to Parent a
description of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal or, inquiry, offer or request, together with a copy of all
documentation relating to any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, offer or
request, the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry, offer or
request, and any other details of the Acquisition Proposal, contract,
documents or negotiations as Parent may reasonably request. Peak will keep
Parent informed of any change to the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or request.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2 or any other
provision of this Agreement, the Board will be permitted to (i) postpone or
adjourn the Peak Meeting; (ii) withdraw, amend, modify or qualify (or propose
to withdraw, amend, modify or qualify) in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser the approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Arrangement;
and (iii) participate in any discussions with, or furnish

 



      
 

 



 

information to any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal by such
Person, if and only to the extent that:

 



 

(A) Peak has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from such Person and the Board has determined that such Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal, for greater clarity, may contain a due diligence
condition) could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(B) Peak will have complied with all other requirements of this Section 7.2
(other than Section 7.2(g));

 



 

(C) the Board, after consultation with and based upon the advice of its
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under all applicable
Laws;

 



 

(D) in the case of clause (iii) of this Section 7.2(d), prior to providing any
information or data to such Person in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, the Board receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement having substantially the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreement
(except that all "no-shop" provisions may be omitted) and, taken as a whole,
being no less favourable to Peak than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided
that such confidentiality agreement, if not existing on the date hereof, may
not preclude Peak from complying with the provisions of this Agreement and may
not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with
Peak and may not prohibit Peak from providing information to Parent regarding
the Acquisition Proposal), and Peak sends a copy of any such confidentiality
agreement to Parent promptly upon its execution and Parent is immediately
provided with a list of, or in the case of information that was not previously
made available to Parent, copies of or access to, any information provided to
such Person; and

 



 

(E) in the case of clause (iii) of this Section 7.2(d), prior to providing any
information or data to any such Person or entering into discussions with any
such Person who has made an Acquisition Proposal, Peak has complied with
Section 7.2(c).

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 will prohibit the Board from making
any disclosure to Peak Shareholders prior to the Effective Time if, in the
good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, such disclosure is necessary for the Board to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties or is otherwise required under applicable
Law.

 



 

(f) Peak will, within five (5) Business Days, promptly publicly reaffirm its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Arrangement after any Acquisition
Proposal that is not a Superior Proposal is publicly announced or made.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 will limit in any way the obligation
of Peak to convene and hold the Peak Meeting in accordance with Section 2.2 of
this Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VIII.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.3.** ** ****_Right to Match_**

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 7.3(b), Peak covenants that it will not accept,
approve, recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding, arrangement or
Contract in respect of a Superior Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement permitted by Section 7.2(d)) unless:

 



 

(i) Peak has complied with its obligations under Section 7.2 and the other
provisions of this Article VII; and

 



 

(ii) a period (the " **Response Period** ") of three Business Days will have
elapsed from the date on which Parent received written notice from the Board
that the Board determined, subject only to compliance with this Section 7.3,
to accept, approve, recommend or enter into a binding agreement to proceed
with the Superior Proposal. In the event that Peak provides Parent with the
notice contemplated in this Section on a date that is less than three Business
Days prior to the Peak Meeting, Peak will be entitled to adjourn the Peak
Meeting to a date that is not more than three Business Days after the date of
such notice.

 



 

(b) During the Response Period, Parent will have the right, but not the
obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement. The Board will
review any such proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement,
including an increase in, or modification of, the consideration to be received
by the Peak Shareholders, to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal to
which Parent is responding would be a Superior Proposal when assessed against
the Arrangement as it is proposed by Parent to be amended. If the Board
determines that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer be a Superior
Proposal if the Arrangement was so amended and Parent and Purchaser enter into
an amendment to this Agreement incorporating the terms of the amended offer,
the Board will promptly publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the
Arrangement. If the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with and based upon the advice of its outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to accept such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under all
applicable Laws, Peak may approve, recommend, accept or enter into an
agreement, understanding or arrangement to proceed with the Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by the Peak Shareholders will constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.3 and Parent will be
afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Peak shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
directors and officers of Peak and each of its Subsidiaries and any investment
bankers, counsel or other advisors, representatives or agents retained by Peak
are aware of, and abide by, the provisions of Sections 7.2 and 7.3.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 7.4.** ** ****_Agreement as to Damages_**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision relating to the payment of fees or
expenses, in the event of termination of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement under the various circumstances set forth below, either Peak or
Parent shall owe the other Party a termination fee and/or reimbursement of
expenses, if any, as follows:

 



 

(i) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to

 



 

(A) Section 8.2(c)(i) [Board fails to recommend, etc.], or

 



 

(B) Section 8.2(c)(ii) [breach by Peak],

 



 

Peak will pay to Parent a termination fee of $5.3 million (the " **Peak
Termination Fee** ") within two Business Days of such termination, plus
ParentÂ’s Expense Reimbursement Costs not to exceed $2.0 million as provided in
Section 7.4(c) below; provided, however, that if Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(ii) based upon a failure of one or more
of PeakÂ’s representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1 to be true
and correct as of the Closing Date and such failure was not the result of a
willful breach of this Agreement by Peak, Peak will be obligated to pay
ParentÂ’s Expense Reimbursement but will not be obligated to pay the Peak
Termination Fee;

 



 

(ii) if

 



 

(A) after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal will have been made or proposed to Peak or
otherwise publicly announced (which has not been withdrawn), or a Person has
publicly announced an intention to do so (which has not been withdrawn),

 



 

(B) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Peak pursuant to Section
8.2(b)(ii) [Required Vote not obtained], and

 



 

(C) such Acquisition Proposal is consummated within six months of the date the
Acquisition Proposal is made or proposed,

 



 

Peak will pay to Parent, within two Business Days of the consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal, ParentÂ’s Expense Reimbursement Costs not to exceed $2.0
million as provided in Section 7.4(c) below; or

 



 

(iii) if Peak terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(i) [Board
approves agreement for Superior Proposal], Peak will pay to Parent the Peak
Termination Fee before or concurrently with such termination (and payment of
the Peak Termination Fee will be a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination), plus ParentÂ’s Expense Reimbursement Costs not to exceed $2.0
million as provided in Section 7.4(c) below.

 



 

(b) If Peak terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(ii)
[ParentÂ’s breach], Parent will pay to Peak a termination fee of $3.0 million
within two Business Days of

 



      
 

 



 

such termination, plus PeakÂ’s Expense Reimbursement Costs not to exceed $1.5
million as provided under Section 7.4(c) below.

 



 

(c) Expense Reimbursement Costs shall be paid not later than two Business Days
after delivery to the Party responsible for such payment of notice of demand
for payment and documented itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all
Expense Reimbursement Costs (which itemization may be supplemented and updated
from time to time until the thirtieth day after delivery of the first notice
of demand for payment), provided that no notice of demand for payment may be
made more than 60 calendar days following the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Peak would have entered
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Peak or Parent fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain the payment,
the Party who is owed such payment commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the other Party for the payment set forth in this Section
7.4, the defaulting Party shall pay to the other Party its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount due from each day for which payment
is due until the date of the payment at the prime rate of the Bank of Canada
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

 **Section 7.5.** ** ****_Fees and Expenses_**

 



 

Except as provided in Section 7.4, each Party will pay all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Agreement and the
Arrangement. For such purposes, the filing fees paid to Governmental Entities
in connection with applicable filings under the Competition Act and any
applicable antitrust laws of other jurisdictions shall be shared equally by
Parent and Peak.

 



 

 **Section 7.6.** ** ****_Liquidated Damages, Injunctive Relief and No
Liability of Others_**

 



 

Parent and Peak acknowledge that all of the payment amounts set out in Section
7.4 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages Parent or Peak will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving
rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement and are
not penalties. Parent and Peak irrevocably waive any right to raise as a
defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For
greater certainty, the Parties agree that, subject to Section 7.4, payment of
the amount determined pursuant to this Article in the manner provided in
respect thereof is the sole monetary remedy of the Party receiving such
payment. Nothing contained herein will preclude a Party from seeking
injunctive relief in accordance with Section 9.3 to restrain any breach or
threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance
of any of such acts, covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting
a bond or security in connection therewith. In the event that either Parent or
Peak become liable to make a payment under Section 7.4, there will be no
liability of any shareholder, director, officer, employee, advisor or
representative of Parent or Peak or any Affiliate thereof, whether to the
other Party or any other Person (including any shareholder,

 



      
 

 



 

director, officer, employee, advisor or representative thereof) in connection
with any liability or other obligation of the Parent or Peak, and whether
hereunder or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 **Section 7.7.** ** ****_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and
the terms of any existing Contracts, Peak will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent
auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to Parent and to its
officers, employees, agents, representatives and advisers such access as
Parent may reasonably request at all reasonable times, including for the
purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to their officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts, and will furnish
Parent with all data and information as Parent may reasonably request. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent and its representatives (including its
financing sources) will, upon reasonable prior notice, have the right to
conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering inspections of each of the
Properties, and to contact any third party to a Material Contract to which
Peak or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, that no such inspections
will be conducted in a manner which disrupts in any material respect the
normal course of business of Peak at the applicable Property. Parent and Peak
acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to this Section
7.7(a) will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. All such access and all requests for information shall be
coordinated through the President and Chief Executive Officer of Peak.

 



 

(b) No investigation conducted pursuant to Section 7.7(a) shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by Peak hereunder, and
nothing in Section 7.7(a) shall require Peak to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of Peak would result
in (i) a violation of any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality
if Peak shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any third
party to such inspection or (ii) any violation of Laws relating to the sharing
of information between competitors, it being understood that (A) Peak will
provide extracts, or summaries, or aggregations or other information to the
greatest extent practicable in a manner that does not result in any such
violation or improper disclosure and (B) Peak will provide certain information
in accordance with, and subject to, the confidentiality provisions of the
Clean Team Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.8.** ** ****_Privacy Compliance_**

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Section 7.8:

 



 

(i) "Disclosed Personal Information" means any Personal Information disclosed
to Purchaser or Parent by Peak or its advisors;

 



 

(ii) "Personal Information" means information about an identifiable
individual, but does not include an individualÂ’s name, position name or title,
business telephone number, business address, business email or business fax
number.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Before the Effective Time, none of the Parties shall use the Disclosed
Personal Information for any purposes other than those related to the
performance of this Agreement and the completion of the Arrangement.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges and confirms that the disclosure of
Personal Information is necessary for the purposes of determining if the
Parties shall proceed with the Arrangement, and that the disclosure of
Personal Information relates solely to the carrying on of PeakÂ’s business or
the completion of the Arrangement.

 



 

(d) Purchaser and Parent shall at all times keep strictly confidential all
Disclosed Personal Information provided to it, and shall instruct those
employees responsible for processing such Disclosed Personal Information to
protect the confidentiality of that information in a manner consistent with
PurchaserÂ’s and ParentÂ’s obligations hereunder. Purchaser and Parent shall
ensure that access to the Disclosed Personal Information prior to the
Effective Time shall be restricted to those employees or service providers of
Purchaser and Parent who have a bona fide need to access such information.

 



 

(e) Purchaser and Parent undertake, after the Effective Time, to utilize the
Disclosed Personal Information only for those purposes for which the Disclosed
Personal Information was initially collected by Purchaser and Parent.

 



 

(f) If the Effective Time does not occur, Purchaser and Parent shall forthwith
cease all use of the Disclosed Personal Information in connection with this
Agreement and will return to Peak or, at PeakÂ’s request, destroy in a secure
manner, the Disclosed Personal Information (and any copies thereof) and
provide Peak with a certificate confirming that destruction.

 



 

 **Section 7.9.** ** ****_Insurance and Indemnification_**

 



 

(a) If the Arrangement shall become effective, Parent will, or will cause Peak
and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect without any reduction in scope or
coverage for six years from the Effective Time customary policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance providing protection equal to or
better than the protection provided by the policies maintained by Peak and its
Subsidiaries which are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts or events which
occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent
will not be required, in order to maintain such directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance policy, to pay, or to cause Peak and its Subsidiaries to
pay, an annual premium in excess of 250% of the cost of the existing policies;
and provided further that, if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can
only be obtained by paying an annual premium in excess of 250% of such amount,
Parent will only be required to obtain, or to cause Peak and its Subsidiaries
to obtain, as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium
equal to 250% of such amount. Furthermore, prior to the Effective Time Peak
may, in the alternative, purchase run off directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance for a period of up to six years from the Effective Time provided
that the premiums will not exceed 250% of the premiums currently charged to
Peak for directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that it will directly honour all rights to indemnification
or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former officers and
directors of Predecessor, Peak and their Subsidiaries which will survive the
completion of the Arrangement.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person described in
Section 7.8(a), his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives and, for
such purpose, the Parties hereby confirm that, in negotiating and agreeing
with the provisions of this Section 7.8, Peak is acting as agent and trustee
on their behalf.

 



 

 **Section 7.10.** ** ****_Exchange De-Listing_**

 



 

Parent and Peak will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Peak Common Shares to be de-listed from the TSX promptly following the
Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 7.11.** ** ****_Tax Matters_**

 



 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Peak
and its Subsidiaries will:

 



 

(a) prepare and timely file all Returns (which shall be correct and complete
in all respects) required to be filed by them on or before the Effective Time
(" **Post-Signing Returns** ") in a manner consistent, in all material
respects, with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws;

 



 

(b) pay, withhold, collect and remit in a timely fashion all amounts of Taxes
required to be so paid, withheld, collected or remitted; and

 



 

(c) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records and
financial statements) for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-Signing
Return is due prior to the Effective Time in a manner consistent with past
practice.

 



 

 **Section 7.12.** ** ****_Resignations_**

 



 

Subject to confirmation that insurance coverage is maintained as contemplated
by Section 7.9, Peak will obtain and deliver to Parent at the Effective Time
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of
the Effective Time of those directors of Peak designated by Parent to Peak in
writing at least five calendar days prior to the Effective Time.

adjournment or postponement thereof); or

financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such definitive agreement
constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) Peak pays to Parent the Peak Termination
Fee in accordance with Section 7.4 (any purported termination pursuant to this

made

 



      
 

 



 

such payment); and (C) Peak shall have no right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.2(d)(i) after the Required Vote for the Arrangement
has been obtained; or

 



 

(ii) if Peak is not in material breach of any of its obligations under this
Agreement and Parent breaches any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b), and which is not cured within the earlier of (A) the Outside Date, and

 **Section 9.2.** ** ****_Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_**

 



 

This Agreement will be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada
applicable therein, and will be construed and treated in all respects as an
Alberta contract. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Alberta in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement and the
Arrangement. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

 **Section 9.3.** ** ****_Injunctive Relief_**

 



 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached for which money damages would not be
an adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, with any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with obtaining any such injunctive or other
equitable relief hereby being waived.

 



 

 **Section 9.4.** ** ****_Time of Essence_**

 



 

Time will be of the essence in this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.5.** ** ****_Entire Agreement, Binding Effect and Assignment_**

 



 

(a) Provided it is acceptable to the Court without the imposition of
commercially unreasonable conditions or any other conditions that would
impede, prevent or materially delay the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Outside Date, Parent and Purchaser may assign all
or any part of their respective rights under this Agreement to, and their
respective obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, a Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Parent or Purchaser, provided that if such assignment and/or
assumption takes place, Parent and Purchaser will continue to be liable
jointly and severally with such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may be,
for all of their respective obligations hereunder. Without limitation of the
foregoing, Parent shall be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Section 9.5(a), to assign prior to the Effective Time, should Parent
elect to do so and by providing prompt written notice to the other Parties, to
either Parent or any wholly-owned

 



      
 

 



 

direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent the rights and obligations of
Purchaser, as the original purchaser under this Agreement and to substitute
either itself or such other wholly-owned Subsidiary as the "Purchaser" under
the Plan of Arrangement. This Agreement will be binding on and will enure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 



 

(b) This Agreement (including the schedules hereto), and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Except as expressly
permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of all of the other Parties.

 



 

 **Section 9.6.** ** ****_Severability_**

 



 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **Section 9.7.** ** ****_No Third Party Beneficiaries_**

 



 

Except as provided in Section 7.9, and except for the rights of the holders of
Peak Common Shares and Peak Options to receive the consideration for their
Peak Common Shares and Peak Options following the Effective Time pursuant to
the Arrangement, which rights are hereby acknowledged and agreed by the
Parties, this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon
any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.8.** ** ****_Rules of Construction_**

 



 

The Parties to this Agreement have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and waive the application of any
Laws or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or
other document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
other document.

 



 

 **Section 9.9.** ** ****_Counterparts, Execution_**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will
be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument. The Parties will be entitled to rely upon delivery of an
executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this Agreement, and
such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy will be legally effective
to create a valid and binding agreement among the Parties.

 



 

[Signature Page Follows]

 



   

     
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and Peak have caused this Agreement to
be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized.

 **ARTICLE 3 
CASH, CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SHARES**

 



 

3.1 **Peak Common Shares.** After the Effective Time, each certificate
formerly representing Peak Common Shares shall represent only the right to
receive the Cash Consideration the holder of Peak Common Shares represented by
the certificate is entitled to in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement
(less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 3.6) upon such holder
depositing with the Depositary the certificate and such other documents and
instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require.

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser shall cause to be deposited,

in the aggregate amount equal to the payments required by section 2.4(a) and
section 2.4(c). The cash deposited in respect of the payments required by
section 2.4(c) shall constitute the Option Payment

      
 

 



 

Loan. All cash deposited with the Depositary shall be held in an interest-
bearing account and any interest earned on such funds shall be for the account
of Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Upon surrender to the Depositary for transfer to Purchaser of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Peak
Common Shares and in respect of which the holder is entitled to receive Cash
Consideration under the Arrangement, together with a duly completed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents and instruments as would have been
required to effect the transfer of Peak Common Shares formerly represented by
such certificate under the ABCA and the by-laws of Peak, and such additional
documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder
of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, the Cash

holder of Peak Options, if any, with an Exercise Price less than the Cash
Consideration, the amount of cash such holder, if any, is entitled to under
section 2.4(c) (less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 3.6). No
interest shall be paid to holders of Peak Options in respect of any cash
payable to such holders under section 2.4(c).

 



 

3.3 **Lost Certificate.** If any certificate, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Peak Common Shares, has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of such

the Depositary, in respect of Peak Common Shares, will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration deliverable to
such holder in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate under
section 2.4(a). When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom the consideration is to be
delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such
consideration, give a bond satisfactory to Purchaser and the Depositary,
acting reasonably, in such sum as Purchaser may direct, or otherwise indemnify
Purchaser, Peak and the Depositary, in a manner satisfactory to Purchaser,
Peak and the Depositary, acting reasonably, against any claim that may be made
against Purchaser, Peak or the Depositary, with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

3.4 **Dividends and Other Payments.** After the Effective Time, holders of
Peak Common Shares shall not be entitled to any interest, dividend, premium or
other payment on or with respect to Peak Common Shares other than the
consideration which they are entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the
Arrangement.

 



 

3.5 **Extinguishment of Rights.** Any certificate formerly representing Peak
Common Shares that is not deposited with all other documents required
hereunder on or before the sixth **** anniversary of the Effective Date shall
cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature, and the right of

receive consideration pursuant to the Arrangement shall be deemed to be
surrendered to Parent together with all dividends, distributions and any
interest thereon held for such holder.

 



 

3.6 **Withholding Rights.** Peak, Parent, Purchaser and the Depositary shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, price or consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Peak Common Shares or Peak Options such
amounts as Peak, Parent, Purchaser or the Depositary is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, or any provision of
federal, provincial,

      
 

 



 

territorial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case as amended. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the securities in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such
withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
Peak, Parent, Purchaser and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or
otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to
provide sufficient funds to Peak, Parent, Purchaser and the Depositary, as the
case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding
requirement, and Peak, Parent, Purchaser or the Depositary shall notify the
holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net
proceeds of such sale.
