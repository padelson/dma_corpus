of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,

1.7.3 Exchange Procedures.   (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the

certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which   
5   immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares

receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares,
less any amount required to be withheld from such cash under foreign,
federal, state or local tax laws), (1) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (2) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates (or book entries in the case of shares that have not yet vested)
representing shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, less any amount required to be withheld from such cash under foreign,
federal, state or local tax laws).   (b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, (A) the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate (or a book entry in the case of shares that have not yet vested
in full) representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product of (i) the number of Company shares represented by such
certificate multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and, if applicable,
payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6(g), and (B) the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled.   (c) In the event that any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by Company shareholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue or cause to be issued to such Person
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, a new certificate
into which the shares of such Person\'s Company Capital Stock that are
converted on the Effective Date and/or, if applicable, deliver or cause to be
delivered to such Person a check in respect of any fractional share interests
or dividends or distributions, which such Person shall be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.6(g). When authorizing such issuance in exchange
therefor, Parent and/or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to give Parent and/or the Exchange Agent a
reasonable form of bond as indemnity, as it shall direct, against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   1.7.4
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the Certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such    6   surrender, the amount of
any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section
1.7(d)) with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.   1.7.5
Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid to the Exchange Agent, Parent
or any other agent designated by Parent, as applicable, any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent, Parent or any other agent designated by Parent, as
applicable, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   1.7.6 No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none
of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Surviving Corporation or any other party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares
of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be exchanged and canceled as provided
in this Article I.   1.9 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.   1.10
Withholding Rights. Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments
made pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent and Surviving
Corporation are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery
and payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
delivered and paid to the holder of shares of    7   Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
and Surviving Corporation.   1.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further
Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company, the
officers and directors of Company, Parent and Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action
is not inconsistent with this Agreement.   Dissenters\' Rights.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each share of
Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Company shareholder who has properly
demanded and perfected such shareholder\'s rights to dissent from the Merger
and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with Sections
11.65 and 11.70 of Illinois Law (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock, but the holder
thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Illinois Law and
Surviving Corporation shall make all payments to the holders of such
Dissenting Shares with respect to such demands in accordance with
Illinois Law; provided however, that if any such holder shall, prior to or
after the Effective Time, have failed to perfect or shall have lost the right
to dissent and obtain payment for such holder\'s Dissenting Shares under the
Illinois Law, each share of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time,
solely the right to receive the Parent Common Stock. Company shall give
prompt written notice to Parent and Merger Sub of any demands received by
Company for payment under Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the Illinois Law, and
the Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub, make any
payment with respect to, settle, or offer to settle, or offer to make any
payment to settle, any such demands, except that Company may make payments to
settle such demands provided that the per share settlement amount does not
exceed the closing market price per share of Company\'s Common Stock as of
the last day of trading prior to the announcement of the Merger.   ARTICLE
2   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   In this Agreement, any
reference to any event, change, condition or effect being "material" with
respect to any entity or group of entities means any material event, change,
condition or effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets (including    8   intangible assets), liabilities,
business, operations or results of operations of such entity and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole.   In this Agreement, any reference to a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event or effect that is
materially adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties,
assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business, operations or
results of operations of Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, however, that none of the following shall be deemed in themselves,
either alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of the following
shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be,
a Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) any change in the market price or
trading volume of Company\'s stock after the date hereof; (b) any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development to the
extent attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger
(including any cancellation of or delays in customer orders, any reduction in
sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor, partner or similar
relationships or any loss of employees); (c) any adverse change, effect,
event, occurrence, state of facts or development attributable to conditions
affecting the industries as a whole in which Company participates, the U.S.
economy as a whole or the foreign economies as a whole in any locations where
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has material operations or sales; or (d)
any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development
arising from or relating to compliance with the terms of, or the taking of
any action required by, this Agreement; or (e) any litigation or other
Proceeding (as defined below) brought by any shareholder, governmental entity
or third-party competitor of Company or Parent after the Execution Date that
(x) is brought or threatened against Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any member of its board of directors in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (y) in the case of a third-party
competitor is brought or threatened against Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any member of its board of directors and is reasonably
likely to have been brought with the intended purpose or effect of
preventing, enjoining, materially altering or delaying or otherwise
interfering with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each a
"Specified Proceeding").   In this Agreement, any reference to a party\'s
"knowledge" means actual knowledge of such party\'s officers and directors,
provided that officers shall have made reasonable due and diligent inquiry of
those employees of such party whom such officers reasonably believe would
have actual knowledge of the matters represented.   In this Agreement, any
reference to a party conducting its business or other affairs or taking any
action in the "ordinary course of business" means that such an action taken
by or on behalf of such party shall not be deemed to have been taken in the

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the Securities Act
and, to Company\'s knowledge, none of the Company SEC Documents contained any

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made

any of its subsidiaries\' business or the holding of any such interest ((i)
and (ii) herein collectively called the "Company Authorizations"), and all of
such Company Authorizations are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to obtain or have any such Company Authorizations could not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   
15    2.9 Title to Personal Property. Company and each of its subsidiaries
has good, valid and marketable title to all of their respective material
personal properties, interests in material personal properties and material
assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet or acquired after the Company

neither Company, nor any fiduciary has any knowledge of any facts that could
give rise to any such action or claim; and (iv) it provides that it may be
amended or terminated at any time and, except for benefits protected under

statements and tax forms) have been delivered to Parent. There are no
negotiations, demands or proposals which are pending or have been made which
concern matters now covered, or that would be covered, by the type of
agreements required to be listed in Schedule 2.13(b) and that are reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   2.12.15 All expenses and
liabilities relating to all of the Plans have been, and will on the Closing
Date be fully and properly accrued on Company\'s books and records and
disclosed in accordance with GAAP and in Plan financial statements.   2.13

employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any other third party, (ii)
materially increase any benefits otherwise payable by Company or any of its

routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent
with past practice). There are no pending claims against Company or any of
its subsidiaries under any workers\' compensation plan or policy or for long
term disability that are not covered by insurance. Neither Company or any of

former employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder, except obligations
that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. There are no
controversies pending or, to the knowledge of Company or any of its

of their respective employees, which controversies have or could reasonably
be expected to result in a Proceeding against Company before any Governmental

Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract, nor does

proprietary information of others. No employees which are considered key to

has not received any notices of violation with respect to any federal, state,
local or foreign statute, law or regulation with respect to the conduct of

Material Contracts is in full force and effect, unamended except as provided
or made available to Parent, and there exists no default or event of default
or event, occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Company or, to
Company\'s knowledge, with respect to the other contracting party, which,
with the giving of notice, the lapse of the time or the happening of any
other event or conditions, would become a default or event of default under
any Material Contract or would give any Person the right to exercise any
remedy, or the right to any rebate, chargeback, penalty or change in delivery
schedule, except to the extent such defaults, remedies, penalties or changes
have not had and would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company.   2.23 Material Third Party Consents. Schedule 2.24 lists
all contracts that require a novation or consent to the Merger or change of
control, as the case may be, prior to the Effective Time so that such
contracts may remain in full force and effect after the Closing (the
"Contracts Requiring Novation or Consent to Change of Control") which, if no
novation occurs or if no consent to the Merger or change of control is
obtained, would have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent\'s ability to
operate the business in the same manner as the business was operated by
Company prior to the Effective Time.   Real Property and Real Property
Leases.   Schedule 2.25(a) sets forth an accurate, correct and complete

respect or prevent it from performing or cause it not to perform its
covenants hereunder.   4.3 No Solicitation.    42    4.3.1 Company and
its subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees or other agents of
Company and its subsidiaries will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate or intentionally encourage any Takeover Proposal
(defined below) or (ii) subject to the terms of Section 4.3(b) below, take
any action to solicit, intentionally facilitate, intentionally encourage or
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or disclose any nonpublic
information relating to Company or any of it subsidiaries to, or afford
access to the properties, books or records of Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, any Person that has advised Company in writing that
it intends to make, or that has made, a Takeover Proposal; provided, nothing
herein shall prohibit Company\'s Board of Directors from complying with Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or
exchange offer.   4.3.2 Notwithstanding Section 4.3(a) above, if an
unsolicited written Takeover Proposal, or an unsolicited written expression
of interest that can reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal,
shall be received by the Board of Directors of Company, then (i) if none of
Company, its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors,
employees or other agents and representatives have violated in any material
respect any of the restrictions in Section 4.3(a), and (ii) to the extent the
Board of Directors of Company believes in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors) that such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be
expected to result in a transaction more favorable to Company\'s shareholders
than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable
Takeover Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior
Proposal"), and (iii) the Board of Directors of Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take
action with respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Company to Company Shareholders
under applicable law, Company and its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives retained by it may furnish in connection with such a Superior
Proposal information and take such other actions with respect to such
Superior Proposal as are consistent with the fiduciary obligations of
Company\'s Board of Directors, and such actions with respect to such Superior
Proposal shall not be considered a breach of Section 4.3(a), provided that in
each such event Company (A) notifies Parent in writing of such determination
by the Company Board of Directors, (B) provides Parent with a summary of the
Superior Proposal received from such third party so long as such disclosure
does not cause the breach of any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements
of Company outstanding as of the Execution Date, and (C) informs Parent
generally of all documents containing or referring to non-public information
of Company that are supplied to such third party so long as such disclosure
does not cause the breach of any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements
of Company outstanding as of the Execution Date. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, neither Company nor its representatives
may take any action with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (x) the Board
of Directors of Company has determined, after consultation with Company\'s
investment bankers, that such third party is actually capable of making a
Superior Proposal upon satisfactory completion of such third party\'s review
of the information supplied by Company, and (y) Company provides such non-
public information to such third party pursuant to a non-disclosure or
confidentiality agreement containing provisions regarding non-disclosure at
least as restrictive as the    43   Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 5.4). Additionally Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its officers, directors, employees or other representatives to agree
to or intentionally endorse any Takeover Proposal (including any Superior
Proposal) unless Parent or Company terminates this Agreement and Company pays
to Parent all amounts payable to Parent as more fully provided in Section
7.3(b) hereof.   4.3.3 Company will promptly notify Parent after receipt,
but in no event later than 24 hours from such receipt, of any Takeover
Proposal or any notice that any Person is considering making a Takeover
Proposal or any request for non-public information relating to Company or any
of its subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
Company or any of its subsidiaries by any Person that has advised Company
that it may be considering making, or that has made, a Takeover Proposal and
will keep Parent fully informed of the status of any such Takeover Proposal
notice or request and shall provide Parent with a true summary of such
Takeover Proposal notice or request.   4.3.4 For purposes of this Agreement,
"Takeover Proposal" means any offer or proposal for, or any indication of
interest in (whether written or oral), a merger or other business combination
involving Company or any of its subsidiaries or the acquisition of any
significant equity interest (30%) in, or a significant portion of the assets
(30% or more on a consolidated basis) of, Company or any of its subsidiaries,
other than the transactions contemplated by or disclosed in this Agreement or
Schedule 2.5.   ARTICLE 5   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   5.1 Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement. Promptly after the execution of
this Agreement, Company and Parent shall prepare, and Parent shall file with
the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or such other form or
successor form as shall be appropriate), which complies in form
with applicable SEC requirements and shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective as soon thereafter as
practicable. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or
information should be discovered by Company which should be set forth in an
amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, Company shall promptly inform Parent. Subject to the provisions of
Section 4.3, the Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of Company that the Company Shareholders vote in favor of
the Merger and approve this Agreement; provided that such recommendation may
not be included or may be withdrawn if previously included if (i) Company\'s
Board of Directors believes in good faith that a Superior Proposal has been
made, and (ii) following consultation with outside legal counsel, Company\'s
Board of Directors determines that the inclusion of such recommendation or
the failure to withdraw such recommendation would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Company to the shareholders of
Company under applicable laws.    44    5.2 Meeting of Shareholders.
Company shall promptly after the date hereof take all action necessary in
accordance with Illinois Law and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days of the
Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC. Company shall
give Parent no less than ten (10) business days advance notice of the date
which shall be set as the "record date" for the Company Shareholders eligible
to vote on this Agreement and the Merger. Company shall also consult with
Parent regarding the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting and shall not
postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum) the Company
Shareholders Meeting without the consent of Parent unless this Agreement is
first terminated by Company pursuant to Article VII hereof. Subject to
Sections 4.3 and 5.1, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from shareholders of Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
the Company Shareholders as required by the rules of Nasdaq, the laws of
Illinois or other applicable law to effect the Merger.   5.3 Access to
Information; Disclosure Schedule Updates.   5.3.1 Upon reasonable notice,
Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, provided that such access does not
cause disruption to the day-to-day operation of Company and provided further
that Parent contacts Company\'s Chief Financial Officer prior to contacting
any other employee of Company, to (i) all of Company\'s properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, and (ii) all other information concerning
the business, properties and personnel of Company as Parent may reasonably
request. Company agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and
other representatives copies of internal financial statements promptly upon
request.   5.3.2 Subject to compliance with applicable law, from the
date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Company and Parent shall confer on a
regular and frequent basis to report operational matters of materiality and
the general status of ongoing operations of Company.   5.3.3 No information
or knowledge obtained in any investigation after the Execution Date pursuant
to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger; provided, however that Company shall promptly
inform Parent of any such information or knowledge obtained in its
investigation which would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Additionally, during the period from the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing
of:    45    (a) the discovery of any event, condition, fact or
circumstance which causes, caused, constitutes or constituted a breach of any
representation or warranty made by Company in this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby to the extent that such event, condition, fact
or circumstance would cause the condition in Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement
not to be satisfied;   (b) any material breach of any covenant or
obligation by Company; and   (c) any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that may make the timely satisfaction of any of the covenants or conditions
set forth in this Article V or Article VI impossible or unlikely.   5.3.4
If any event, condition, fact or circumstances that is required to be
disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(c) requires any material change in
Company\'s Disclosure Schedule, or if any such event, condition, fact
or circumstance would require such a change assuming Company\'s Disclosure
Schedule were dated as of the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery
of such event, condition, fact or circumstances, then Company shall promptly
deliver to Parent an update to its Disclosure Schedule specifying such change
(a "Disclosure Schedule Update"). Notwithstanding anything therein to the
contrary, no such update shall be deemed to supplement or amend Company\'s
Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (A) determining the accuracy of any of
the representations and warranties made by such party in this Agreement, or
(B) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in Article VI has
been satisfied.   5.3.5 Company shall provide Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of Company\'s Tax
Returns and other records and workpapers relating to Taxes, provided that
such access does not cause disruption to the day-to-day operation of Company
and provided further that Parent contacts Company\'s Chief Financial Officer
prior to contacting any other employee of Company, and shall provide to
Parent and its representatives the following information promptly upon the
request of Parent: (i) the types of Tax Returns being filed by Company in
each taxing jurisdiction, (ii) the year of the commencement of the filing of
each such type of Tax Return, (iii) all closed years with respect to each
such type of Tax Return filed in each jurisdiction, (iv) all material Tax
elections filed in each jurisdiction by Company, (v) any deferred
intercompany gain with respect to transactions to which Company has been a
party, and (vi) receipts for any Taxes paid to foreign Tax authorities.  
5.4 Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that Parent and Company have
previously executed a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated August 8,
2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit D, which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.    46    5.5 Public Disclosure.
Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press
releases or otherwise make any public statements or make any other public (or
non-confidential) disclosures (whether or not in response to an inquiry)
regarding the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and neither shall issue a press release or make any statements or
disclosures without the prior written approval of the other (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or with the NASD.   5.6 Consents; Cooperation.   5.6.1 Each of
Parent and Company shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals
required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the Merger, including
those required under HSR. Company and Parent shall each use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers
and approvals under any of their respective material contracts in connection
with the Merger for the assignment thereof or otherwise. The parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to HSR or any other federal or state antitrust or fair
trade law.   5.6.2 Each of Parent and Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under HSR, the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other Federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or
decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively,
"Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and Company shall cooperate and use all
commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent (each an "Order"), that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any such other
transactions, unless by mutual agreement Parent and Company decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is expressly understood
and agreed that neither party shall have any obligation to litigate or
contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any Order
beyond the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of Parent and Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under HSR or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement.    47    5.6.3 Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 5.6(a) or (b), (i) Parent shall not be required to divest
any of its or its subsidiaries\' businesses, product lines or assets, or to
take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation where such
divestiture or other action could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or of Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time, and (ii) Company and its subsidiaries shall not be required to divest
any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or
agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation where such
divestiture or other action could reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   5.6.4 Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, with evidence
satisfactory to it of the consent or approval of those Persons whose consent
or approval shall be required in connection with the Merger under the
contracts of Company set forth, or required to be set forth, on Schedule
2.25.   5.7 Affiliates. Schedule 5.7 sets forth those persons who may be
deemed "affiliates" of Company as such term is used in the Securities Act and
the regulations thereunder. Company shall provide Parent with such
information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of
reviewing such list. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to place
appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to
be received by such Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to
issue appropriate stock transfer instructions to the transfer agent for
Parent Common Stock.   5.8 Voting Agreement. Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, on behalf of Parent, and pursuant to the
request of Parent, to cause the officers, directors and shareholders of
Company listed on Schedule 5.8 to execute and deliver to Parent a Shareholder
Voting Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and
an Irrevocable Proxy substantially in the form of Attachment A attached
thereto concurrently with the execution of this Agreement.   5.9 FIRPTA.
Company shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, provide Parent with a
properly executed FIRPTA Notification Letter, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E, which states that shares of capital stock
of Company do not constitute "United States real property interests" under
Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes of satisfying Parent\'s obligations
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition, simultaneously
with delivery of such Notification Letter, Company shall have provided to
Parent, as agent for Company, a form of notice to the Internal Revenue
Service in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h)(2) and substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F,
along with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to
the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Company upon the Closing of the
Merger.   5.10 Legal Requirements. Each of Parent and, subject to Sections
4.3 and 5.1 of this Agreement, Company, shall take all reasonable actions
necessary to comply promptly with all    48   legal requirements which
may be imposed on them with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to any party hereto necessary in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with the
other parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity or other Person, required to be obtained or made in
connection with the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement.  
5.11 Employee Benefit Plans.   5.11.1 Assumption of Company Options. At the
Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plans will be assumed by Parent and
each outstanding Company Option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under the Company Stock Option Plans, whether vested or unvested, will be
assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock (each a "Parent Option"). Schedule 5.11(a) hereto sets forth a
true and complete list as of the date hereof of all holders of outstanding
Company Options under each of the Company Stock Option Plans, including the
number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject to each such option, the
exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of
each such option. On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an
updated Schedule 5.11(a) hereto current as of such date. Except as provided
below or on Schedule 5.11(a), each such Company Option so assumed by Parent
under this Agreement shall retain its respective vesting schedule under the
applicable Company Stock Option Plan and its respective stock option
agreement and each such Company Option shall continue to be subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan,
except that (i) each such option will be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of such option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, assuming that all vesting conditions
applicable to such option were then satisfied, multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest tenth
of a cent. Consistent with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and
the documents governing the outstanding Company Options under such plans,
except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.11(a), the Merger will not
terminate any of the outstanding Company Options under the Company Stock
Option Plans or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options or
the shares of Parent Common Stock which will be subject to those options upon
the assumption of the Company Options in connection with the Merger. It is
the intention of the parties that the Company Options assumed by Parent
qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time, as
incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the
extent, and only to the extent, the Company Options so replaced qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the    49   Effective Time. Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts, within thirty days after the Form S-8
filed pursuant to Section 5.13 hereof is declared effective, to issue to each
Person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of an
outstanding Company Option, a copy of the effective Form S-8 and such other
documents as are reasonably advisable, as evidence of the
foregoing assumption of such Company Options by Parent. The Company Board of
Directors shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to
or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act, the deemed disposition and cancellation of the Company Options
in the Merger. Provided that Company shall first provide to Parent the names
of its shareholders and the number of shares of Company Capital Stock or
Company Options which may be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and
any other information reasonably requested by Parent and relating to the
same, the Board of Directors of Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time,
take appropriate action to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act, the deemed grant of options to purchase Parent Common Stock
under the Company Options (as assumed pursuant to this Section 5.11(a)). As
of or prior to the Effective Time, the disposition of shares of Company
Common Stock by the Company executive officers and Board members and the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to such persons in the Merger shall
also be included in the approval process of the Boards of Directors of
Company and Parent for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.  
5.11.2 Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause
all outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP to be exercised upon
the earlier of (i) the next scheduled purchase date under the Company
ESPP, or (ii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each participant
in the Company ESPP shall accordingly be issued shares of Company Common
Stock at that time which shall be converted into shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate the Company ESPP as of such exercise date, and no purchase rights
shall be subsequently granted or exercised under the Company ESPP. Employees
of Company and other Members of the Controlled Group who become employees of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be permitted
to participate in the Parent ESPP commencing on the first enrollment date
following the Effective Time, subject to compliance with the eligibility
provisions of such plan (with employees receiving credit, for purposes of
such eligibility provisions, for service with the Company or any other Member
of the Controlled Group to the extent permitted by applicable law and
applicable tax qualification requirements).   5.11.3 Company Notes.
Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall execute and deliver a
supplemental indenture with the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Trustee, to provide for (1) the express assumption by Parent
of the Indenture, the Company Notes and all liabilities and obligations of
the Company thereunder; and (2) an amendment to the conversion terms of the
Company Notes to provide for the right of the holders of Company Notes to
convert into Parent Common Stock. Parent will succeed to and be substituted
for the Company in the original Company Note documents (including the
Indenture (as supplemented) and the Registration Rights Agreement).   
50    5.11.4 Termination of Employee Plans. If requested by
Parent, Company shall, immediately prior to the Closing Date, terminate the
Company Plans and no further contributions shall be made to the Company
Plans, provided that, as conditions of such termination, (i) Company\'s
employees who become employees of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall
receive employee benefits which in the aggregate are no less favorable than
those provided from time to time by Parent and its subsidiaries to their
respective similarly situated employees; and (ii) Company\'s employees shall
be eligible to participate in Parent\'s 401(k) plan immediately following the
Closing Date, subject to compliance with the eligibility provisions of such
plan. Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be
provided that under each employee benefit plan, policy, program or
arrangement where service is relevant to a determination of an employee\'s
eligibility to participate, vesting, or level or amount of benefits,
employees of Company who become employees of Parent and/or Surviving
Corporation shall be credited with their period of service with Company prior
to the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and applicable tax
qualification requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in
service or similar rules. Subject to the approval of any insurance carrier
and to the extent consistent with applicable law and applicable tax
qualification requirements, Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall make
available, or cause to be made available, to those employees of Company who
become employees of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, medical, dental,
disability and other welfare benefits plans and programs, to the extent the
same is offered by Parent and/or Surviving Corporation generally to
their respective employees, without regard to any preexisting condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or similar limitation, provided, and
only to the extent, that any analogous restriction applied to such employee
under an analogous plan of Company had been satisfied as of the Closing Date.
In determining an employee\'s share of the cost of coverage under any plan
or program of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation for the year in which the
Closing occurs, Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to credit the employee with any pre-Closing co-pays and
deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee under each comparable plan
maintained by Company prior to the Effective Time for such year. Parent shall
not be required to have any preexisting condition limitation, actively-at-
work requirement or similar limitation waived or to credit any pre-Closing
co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee unless Company
(or its successor entity) or the applicable insurance carrier makes available
a HIPAA Certificate evidencing prior coverage under the corresponding or
analogous Company plan. Company shall provide to Parent (i) executed
resolutions by the Board of Directors of Company authorizing the termination
and (ii) an executed amendment to the Plans sufficient to assure compliance
with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder so
that the tax-qualified status of the Plan will be maintained at the time of
termination.   5.11.5 Assumption. Parent shall, or shall cause
Surviving Corporation to assume each of the employment agreements listed on
Schedule 5.11(e).   5.12 Indemnification.    51    5.12.1 After the
Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors,
employees and agents of Company (the "Indemnified Parties") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time to the extent
provided for under the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and
each indemnification agreement with Company officers and directors to
which Company is a party, in each case in effect on the date hereof; provided
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from
time to time under applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing, in
the event any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any capacity
in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any matter
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation
to pay as incurred such Indemnified Party\'s reasonable legal and other
expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation) incurred
in connection therewith.   5.12.2 For six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent will, and will cause Surviving Corporation to, use best efforts
to provide officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Person currently covered by Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policy on terms at least as favorable as the coverage currently in
effect on the date hereof, provided that in satisfying its obligation under
this Section 5.12(b), Parent shall not be obligated to cause Surviving
Corporation to pay premiums in excess of 150% of the amount per annum Company
paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has been disclosed to Parent
and if Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by
this Section 5.12(b), it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum amount.   5.12.3 For a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the extent there is any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether commencing before
or after the Effective Time) against or involving any Indemnified Party that
arises out of or pertains to any action or omission (or alleged action or
omission) in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent
of Company, which act omission occurred prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause Surviving Corporation to, provide legal counsel and to
defend such Indemnified Party and to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel. Parent shall, and shall cause Surviving Corporation, to
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that neither
Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided, further, that,
in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or
made within such six-year period all rights to indemnification in respect to
any such claim or claims shall continue until the final disposition of any
and all such claims.   5.12.4 Parent shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
5.12 to the extent that such Indemnified Party is determined to be entitled
to indemnification under this Section 5.12.    52    5.12.5 The
provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives.   5.12.6 In the event Parent or Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.   5.13 Form
S-8. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the
exercise of the Company Options assumed in accordance with Section 5.11(a).
As soon as practicable and in no event more than twenty (20) days after the
Closing, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such options or on another appropriate form
of registration statement for any such shares of Parent Common Stock which
are not registrable on Form S-8 and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. Company
will cooperate and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration
statement(s).   5.14 Treatment as Reorganization. Neither Company nor Parent

with the representation letters also described in Section 6.1(e).   5.15

for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS TO THE
MERGER   No party may refuse to close if any condition remains unsatisfied
where such party\'s failure to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the condition not being
satisfied.   6.1 Conditions to Obligations of Each Party to Effect the
Merger. The respective obligations of each party to this Agreement to
consummate and effect this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of

authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (which has jurisdiction
over Company or Parent), seeking any of the foregoing be pending; nor shall
there be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger, which makes

54   other order shall have been issued, each party agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted.   6.1.4
Governmental Approval. Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall have timely

Opinion. Each of Parent and Company shall have received written opinions of
its respective legal counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory

Date to the effect that the Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent, Merger Sub
and Company is a "party to a reorganization" within the meaning of Section

opinion, this condition shall nevertheless be deemed satisfied with
respect to Company if Parent\'s legal counsel renders such opinion to Parent.
The parties to this Agreement agree to make such reasonable representations
as requested by the legal counsel of Parent and/or Company for the purpose of

been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a
vote held at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at any adjournment
thereof.   7.1.2 As used herein, a "Trigger Event" shall occur if any

provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part, of Parent, Merger Sub

covenants set forth in this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the
