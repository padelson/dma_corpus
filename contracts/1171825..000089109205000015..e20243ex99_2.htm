Merger Sub to, offer to purchase (the &#147;Offer&#148;) each outstanding share of the common

Consideration&#148;), and to cause the Offer to remain open until the close of business on the
twentieth business day after the commencement of the Offer (the &#147;Expiration Date&#148;). The
obligations of Merger Sub and Parent to consummate the Offer and to accept for payment
and purchase the Common Stock tendered in the Offer will be subject only to the
conditions set forth in Schedule 1.01(a) (Offer Conditions) (the &#147;Offer Conditions&#148;). At

days following the Expiration Date if the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Offer
Conditions) is not fulfilled prior to 12:00 p.m. on the Expiration Date; provided,
however, in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond March 31,

directors, or both, to permit that number of Merger Sub&#146;s designees to be elected to the

is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Transaction and (2) the failure to take
such action would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company under Applicable Law and (C) in the case of the disclosure of nonpublic
information relating to the Company in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal,
such information is covered by a confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to
the Company than is afforded by the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company will promptly
notify Parent orally, and confirm such notification in writing within 24 hours of such
notification, of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries with respect thereto.
Any such written notification will include the identity of the Person making such inquiry
or Company Acquisition Proposal and a description of the material terms of the Company
Acquisition Proposal (or the nature of the inquiry) and will indicate whether the Company
is providing or intends to provide the Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal
with access to nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Company Acquisition Proposal&#148; means any good faith offer
or proposal for (x) a merger or other business combination involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary
of either Parent or Merger Sub), (y) an acquisition by any Person (other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of either Parent or Merger Sub) of assets or earning
power of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, in one or more transactions, representing
25% or more of the consolidated assets or earning power of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries, or (z) an acquisition by any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Subsidiary of either Parent or Merger Sub) of securities representing
25% or more of the voting power of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Superior
Transaction&#148; means a transaction embodying a Company Acquisition Proposal having terms
(including conditions to consummation of the contemplated transaction) that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines, in its good faith judgment, to be more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders than the Offer and Merger and for which financing, to
the extent required, is then committed or is reasonably likely to be obtained in a timely
manner. </FONT></P>
