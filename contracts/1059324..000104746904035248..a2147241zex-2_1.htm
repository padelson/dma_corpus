 PETROHAWK will, and will cause WCE and such Partnerships to, execute and deliver such consents and approvals as are reasonably requested to effect for the STOCKHOLDERS the provisions of this clause 7 and the use by the STOCKHOLDERS of such name. 

  

 8. Each of the STOCKHOLDERS, WCE and PETROHAWK will use his, her or its reasonable best efforts to take all action and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable in order to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in Sections VI and VII and below, and any governmental authorizations necessary for the consummation of such transactions).

 (i)

 by mutual consent of the Parties;  


(ii)

 by WCE or the STOCKHOLDERS if the conditions set forth in Paragraph VI are not satisfied or waived prior to Closing;  


(iii)

(iv)

X 
 Indemnification Escrow

  

 A. _ Survival of Representations and Warranties._ All representations, warranties, and covenants made by WCE and the STOCKHOLDERS in this Agreement shall survive the Closing only to the extent provided in the succeeding provisions of this Paragraph X. 

  

 B. _ Indemnification._ To indemnify, defend and hold harmless PETROHAWK from and against all Damages incurred, directly, by reason of, or resulting from: 

  

 

 (i)

 any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by WCE to any brokers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or comparable other Persons retained or employed by it or them in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement; and  


(ii)

 (A) the inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and warranties of WCE or the STOCKHOLDERS contained in this Agreement and (B) the breach of any of the covenants and agreements of WCE or the STOCKHOLDERS contained in this Agreement; 
 

  
  

the STOCKHOLDERS will deposit the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to clause
VIII.B.2.

        

 C. _ Limitations on Liability of WCE and Limitations on Damages._ 

  

  

 (a) Any assertion by PETROHAWK that it has sustained damages as a result of (i) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by WCE or the STOCKHOLDERS, or (ii) the breach of any covenant of WCE or the STOCKHOLDERS herein, must be made by PETROHAWK and delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent on or before six (6) months after the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) No claim shall be made under this Paragraph X by any Party or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein until the sum of the amount of Damages actually incurred by PETROHAWK and attributable to such claim exceeds the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000); provided, however, that this deductible shall not be applicable to claims made pursuant to Section X.B.(i) or Section II.A.14. If Closing occurs, except to the extent otherwise provided in this Paragraph X, WCE and the STOCKHOLDERS shall be liable to PETROHAWK (i) only with respect to claims made prior to the deadline set forth in Section X.C.(a) above, (ii) for and only to the extent of Damages in excess of the Deductible, and (iii) for and only to the extent of the Indemnification Escrow Amount. If Closing occurs, PETROHAWK acknowledges and agrees that PETROHAWK\'s right to recover for Damages is expressly limited to recovery from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and that PETROHAWK shall have no other right to recover Damages with respect to the transactions described in this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Under no circumstances whatsoever may either Party recover exemplary, punitive, treble, special, indirect, consequential, remote or speculative damages from the other Party. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the limitations provided in this Section X.C. shall not apply in the case of fraud. 

  

  

 D. _ Notice of Claims._ If an indemnity claim is asserted for which PETROHAWK may have a right of recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Amount (or would have, but for the application of the Deductible), PETROHAWK shall give the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent written notice of the claim setting forth the particulars associated with the claim (including a copy of the written claim, if any) as then known by PETROHAWK (" _Claim Notice_ "). PETROHAWK shall effect notice within such time as will allow the Exchange Agent a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond to the claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,  the foregoing shall not extend the time limitations set forth in Section X.C.(a); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that PETROHAWK shall not be required to provide a Claim Notice unless and until it believes that the claim underlying the indemnity claim could reasonably be expected to exceed the Deductible. If PETROHAWK reasonably believes that it is entitled to indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow Amount for the claim which is the subject of the Claim Notice, the Claim Notice shall so state (such a notice being an " _Indemnity Claim Notice_ "). 

  

 E. _ Defense of Claims._ Upon receipt of a timely Indemnity Claim Notice, the Exchange Agent may (without prejudice to its right to contest the right of PETROHAWK of indemnity under this Agreement) assume the defense of the claim with counsel selected by the Exchange Agent and reasonably satisfactory to PETROHAWK. PETROHAWK shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense. In all instances, PETROHAWK may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any claim; _provided_ , _however_ , the fees and expenses of counsel employed by PETROHAWK will be borne solely by PETROHAWK. If the Exchange Agent does not notify PETROHAWK within the earlier to occur of: 

  

  

 (a) three (3) days before the time a response is due in any litigation matter (so long as the Indemnity Claim Notice was presented to the Exchange Agent at least ten (10) days prior to the date the response is due), or 

  

      

  

 (b) thirty (30) days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, that the Exchange Agent elects to undertake the defense of the claim, PETROHAWK may defend the claim with counsel of PETROHAWK\'s choice, subject to the right of the Exchange Agent to assume the defense of the claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. In such event, PETROHAWK shall promptly send written notice to the Exchange Agent of any proposed settlement of the claim, which settlement the Exchange Agent may accept or reject, in its reasonable judgment, within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice, unless the settlement offer is limited to a shorter period in which case the Exchange Agent will have such shorter period in which to accept or reject the proposed settlement. Failure of the Exchange Agent to accept or reject such settlement within the applicable period will be deemed a rejection of the proposed settlement. 

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, PETROHAWK may settle any matter over the
objection of the Exchange Agent, but in so doing PETROHAWK will waive any
right to indemnity therefor as to (and only as to) liabilities with respect
to which the Exchange Agent has acknowledged in writing its indemnity
obligation.

  

 F. _ Express Negligence; Conspicuousness._ THE INDEMNIFICATION, RELEASE AND ASSUMPTION PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. PETROHAWK, WCE AND THE STOCKHOLDERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

  

 G. _ Exclusive Remedy._ If the Closing occurs, the sole and exclusive remedy of each of PETROHAWK and its subsidiaries with respect to the transactions provided for in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the express indemnification provisions of this Paragraph X. Any and all claims relating to the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, other claims pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this Paragraph X. 

  

 H. _ Indemnification Escrow Amount Release._ The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be maintained in escrow for six (6) months following the Closing Date and for so long thereafter as is required to resolve any claims asserted by PETROHAWK prior to the expiration of such six (6) month period. On the first business day after the expiration of such six (6) month period, there shall be released to the Exchange Agent all of that portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount which is in excess of claims asserted hereunder during such six (6) month period which remain unresolved. Upon the later of (i) the expiration of such six (6) month period or (ii) the resolution of any such claims asserted prior to the expiration of such six (6) month period, if applicable, the escrow shall close, and the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be released to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. The costs and expenses associated with the escrow pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement (x) shall be paid from time to time in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and (y) shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by PETROHAWK and fifty percent (50%) by the Exchange Agent.

 F. _ Expenses._ Each party shall be solely responsible for all expenses incurred by it in connection with this transaction, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of its own counsel and accountants, and shall not be entitled to any reimbursement therefor from any other party hereto, regardless of whether or not the Merger herein provided is effected. 

   

 G. _ Inconsistent Activities._ Unless and until this Agreement has been terminated as provided herein, neither WCE nor the STOCKHOLDERS shall (i) solicit, discuss or otherwise entertain, any offer to acquire, directly or indirectly, WCE, any Target Entity, or any of the Target Entity Properties or any interest therein; or (ii) provide information to others concerning WCE or the Target Entity Properties, except as required by law. 

  

 H. _ Publicity and Confidentiality._ No Party shall provide any information concerning (i) the existence or terms of this Agreement, (ii) the Target Entity Properties, or (iii) any aspect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to anyone other than their respective affiliates, lending institutions, investment bankers, officers, employees and representatives, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or any exchange or association on which either shares or securities of a party are traded or as necessary to qualify for an exemption for registration in connection with an exempt offering of PETROHAWK securities. WCE and the STOCKHOLDERS acknowledge that PETROHAWK is publicly-traded company and is required to disclose the existence of material agreements through filings with the SEC and PETROHAWK will be required to disclose and file this Agreement with the SEC and it will become public upon such disclosure, and PETROHAWK will issue a press release immediately after the execution of this Agreement which will contain details of the transactions contemplated herein and in the Partnerships Merger Agreement. 

        
  

 The STOCKHOLDERS and WCE understand that PETROHAWK may desire to discuss with other parties prior to Closing the sale of WCE or a portion of the Properties to such other parties in transactions that may occur concurrent with or shortly after the Closing. Prior to the disclosure by PETROHAWK of confidential information to such other parties, PETROHAWK will notify the STOCKHOLDERS and WCE in writing of such fact, of the identity of such parties and the Properties being considered for sale, and of the confidential information proposed to be disclosed. Within five (5) days after receipt of such notice, WCE and the STOCKHOLDERS will notify PETROHAWK in writing of their consent to the disclosure of such information or of their refusal of such consent. The failure of the STOCKHOLDERS and WCE to so notify PETROHAWK shall constitute the consent of the STOCKHOLDERS and WCE to such particular disclosure. 

  

 No confidential information shall be so disclosed by PETROHAWK without the consent of the STOCKHOLDERS and WCE, and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the consent of the STOCKHOLDERS and WCE to such a disclosure, such confidential information shall be disclosed only to a party that has agreed by written instrument to be bound by and to comply with the provisions of this Section XI.H.

The Parties shall cooperate to provide all necessary access to the information required for any such audit. 

  

 J. _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
