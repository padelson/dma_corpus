the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Target is to be
amended and restated in its entirety by reason of the Merger, and the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the

Merger until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such Certificate
of Incorporation.



Section 2.2 _Bylaws_. From and after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.



 

2 Section 2.3 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately

officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and

ARTICLE III  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK



Section 3.1 _Merger Consideration_. In full satisfaction of Acquirors
obligations hereto, the aggregate consideration to be paid in accordance with
the terms of this Article III to the holders of Options, Warrants and Target
Stock hereunder shall be the sum of (i) $268,750,000 plus (ii) the Closing
Date Cash Amount Estimate, if any, plus (iii) the Estimated Net Working
Capital Surplus, if any, minus (iv) the Estimated Net Working Capital
Deficiency, if any, as determined and adjusted in accordance with the terms of
this Article III (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").



(a)  _Closing Date Cash Amount_. On the third Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Acquiror (i) an estimate (the " _Closing
Date Cash Amount Estimate_ ") as of the Closing Date of the sum of (A) the
amount of cash and cash equivalents (excluding any amounts to be paid as
Closing Acquisition Expenses), minus (B) the amount of Indebtedness of the
Target Companies, plus (C) the amount and description of additions to the
property and equipment of the Target Companies made since May 31, 2005 to the
extent that such additions are set forth in Schedule 3.1(a) and are actually
made (including, for these purposes, any deposit paid relating thereto) before
the Closing Date, such additions not to exceed $7,452,073 in the aggregate
and individual line items not to exceed budgeted amounts therefor, in each
case, without the prior written consent of Acquiror (the " _Closing Date Cash
Amount_ "), (ii) a statement setting forth an estimate of the Closing
Acquisition Expenses and (iii) a certificate, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Acquiror, executed by the Chief Executive Officer of Target
and the Chief Financial Officer of Target, stating that the Closing Date Cash
Amount Estimate has been prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP
(subject to the lack of footnotes) and on a basis consistent with and
utilizing the same principles, practices and policies as those used in
preparing the Balance Sheet. Acquiror shall be given timely access to all
supporting workpapers and any other documentation used in preparation of the
Closing Date Cash Amount Estimate for purposes of verifying the accuracy and
fairness of the Closing Date Cash Amount Estimate.



(b) _Estimated Net Working Capital Balance_. On the third Business Day prior
to the Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Acquiror (i) an estimate (the "
_Closing Date Working Capital Estimate_ ") of the sum of the current assets
(excluding cash and cash equivalents) minus current liabilities (excluding
Indebtedness and deferred Tax liabilities) of the Target Companies as of the
Closing Date (excluding for these purposes the Closing Acquisition Expenses)
and (ii) a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Acquiror, executed by the Chief Executive Officer of Target and the Chief
Financial Officer of Target, stating that the Closing Date Working Capital
Estimate has been prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP (subject
to the lack of footnotes) and on a basis consistent with and utilizing the
same principles, practices and policies as those used in preparing the Balance
Sheet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital Estimate shall not take into
account (x) any accrual or expenses in relation to any Option Award Amount or
any Option Exercise (except for any expenses in excess of $780,000 for
Medicare payroll taxes in connection with the Option Award Amount or any
Option Exercise) or (y) the Tax effect of any such amounts. Acquiror shall be
given timely access to all supporting workpapers and any other documentation
used in preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital Estimate for purposes
of verifying the accuracy and fairness of the Closing Date Working Capital
Estimate. If the Closing Date Working Capital Estimate is greater than the
Working Capital Target, then the " _Estimated Net Working_



 

3 _Capital Surplus_ " shall be equal to such excess. If the Closing Date Working
Capital Estimate is less than the Working Capital Target, then the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency_ " shall be equal to such
deficiency. The " _Working Capital Target_ " shall mean $11,727,943, which is
based on the Balance Sheet and calculated as set forth in Appendix 3.1(A).



(c) _Closing Date Payments_. The Merger Consideration shall be paid by
Acquiror by Wire Transfer as follows:



(i) to the Paying Agent, on behalf of the holders of Options, Warrants and
Target Stock, the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration, which
amount includes the Hold-Back Amount, _less_ the amount of the Escrow Amount;
and



(ii) to the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Preferred Stockholders and the
Management Stockholders (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Stockholders_ "),
$27,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") (the Escrow Amount, plus any interest
paid on such amount, are herein referred to as the " _Escrow Fund_ ") for the
purpose of securing (A) the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Stockholders set forth in this agreement, (B) payment of the Post-Closing
Acquisition Expenses, if any, (C) the Net Consideration Adjustment, if any, to
the extent it exceeds the Hold-Back Amount, and (D) payments pursuant to
Article VIII. The Escrow Amount, which shall be comprised of amounts of
Merger Consideration allocable to the Indemnifying Stockholders as set forth
in Appendix 3.3 and Appendix 3.4, shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held
as two separate trust funds. The Escrow Fund comprised of the Merger
Consideration set forth in Appendix 3.3 (the " _Stockholder Trust Fund_ ")
shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any judicial
process of any creditor of any party and shall be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the applicable terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Fund comprised of the Merger Consideration set forth in
Appendix 3.4 (the " _Management Escrow_ ") shall be held in a "rabbi trust,"
subject to the claims of Acquirors creditors in the event of Acquirors
insolvency, according to "rabbi trust" terms substantially similar to those
approved by the IRS in Rev. Proc. 92-64, and shall be held and disbursed
solely for the purposes and in accordance with the applicable terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Management Escrow shall be structured so that the
Management Stockholders are not subject to income tax on the Escrow Amount
until distributions are made to the Management Stockholders from the
Management Escrow. All interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount
in the Stockholder Trust Fund through the Final Escrow Release Date will
become part of the Stockholder Trust Fund and any portion of such interest and
other income remaining in the Stockholder Trust Fund will be allocated to the
Indemnifying Stockholders in proportion to the Merger Consideration set forth
in Appendix 3.3 on the Final Escrow Release Date and released to the
Stockholder Representative for disbursement to the Indemnifying Stockholders
in accordance with Section 10.6. All interest and other income earned on the
Escrow Amount in the Management Escrow through the Final Escrow Release Date
will become part of the Management Escrow and any portion of such interest and
other income remaining in the Management Escrow will be allocated to
the Management Stockholders in proportion to the Merger Consideration set
forth in Appendix 3.4 on the Final Escrow Release Date and released to the
Stockholder Representative for disbursement to the Management Stockholders in
accordance with Section 10.6. Acquiror shall have the right to receive a
distribution from each of the Management Escrow and the Stockholder Trust Fund
on a periodic basis in an amount equal to thirty-seven percent of the interest
and other income earned on the Management Escrow and the Stockholder Trust
Fund, respectively. Acquiror is intended to be, and shall be treated as, the
owner for Tax purposes of all of the Merger Consideration held in the Escrow
Fund and all of the items of income, deductions and credits attributable to
the Merger Consideration and shall be liable for and pay all Taxes with
respect to such amounts. In satisfaction of the payment of any Post-Closing
Acquisition Expenses by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation (in excess of
any amounts accrued therefor on the Final Closing Balance Sheet), Acquiror and
the Stockholder Representative shall deliver



 

4 joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent within two Business Days from
the date on which notice of any Post-Closing Acquisition Expenses is received
by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, instructing the Escrow Agent to pay
to Acquiror by Wire Transfer within two Business Days of receipt of such
instructions an amount equal to the Post-Closing Acquisition Expenses from
the Escrow Fund.



(d) On the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Acquiror updated appendices, if any, setting
forth with respect to each Stockholder (Appendix 3.3), Option holder (Appendix
3.4) and Warrant holder (Appendix 3.5) (i) an amount payable to each Holder
at Closing (ii) the portion of the Hold-Back Amount allocable to each Holder
at Closing and (iii) in the case of each Indemnifying Stockholder, the amount
of Merger Consideration such Stockholder is required to contribute to the
Escrow Amount. Each such appendix shall be in the format of (and on a basis
consistent with) the methodology set forth in Appendix 3.1. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that in no event shall the amount of the Merger Consideration
contributed to the Escrow Amount from Options exceed $6,000,000.



(e) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.



(i) As used in this Section 3.1(e):



(A) " _Closing Cash Deficit_ " shall mean the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Date Cash Amount, as ultimately determined by reference to the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, is less than the Closing Date Cash Amount Estimate.



(B) " _Closing Cash Surplus_ " shall mean the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Date Cash Amount, as ultimately determined by reference to the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, is greater than the Closing Date Cash Amount Estimate.



(C) " _Final Net Working Capital Balance_ " shall mean the sum of the current
assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) minus the current liabilities
(excluding Indebtedness and deferred Tax liabilities) of the Target Companies
as of the Closing Date as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the calculation of
Final Net Working Capital Balance shall not take into account (1) any accrual
or expenses in relation to any Option Award Amount or any Option Exercise
(except for any expenses in excess of $780,000 for Medicare payroll taxes in
connection with the Option Award Amount or any Option Exercise) or (2) the Tax
effect of any such amounts.



(D) " _Net Consideration Adjustment_ " means the sum of (1) the Closing Cash
Deficit, if any, expressed as a negative number, plus (2) the Closing Cash
Surplus, if any, expressed as a positive number, plus (3) the Working Capital
Deficit, if any, expressed as a negative number, plus (4) the Working
Capital Surplus, if any, expressed as a positive number.



(E) " _Working Capital Deficit_ " shall mean the amount, if any, by which the
Final Net Working Capital Balance is less than the Closing Date Working
Capital Estimate.



(F) " _Working Capital Surplus_ " shall mean the amount, if any, by which the
Final Net Working Capital Balance is greater than the Closing Date Working
Capital Estimate.



(ii) As promptly as possible after the Closing Date, but in no event more than
sixty days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a closing balance sheet of Target prepared as of the Closing
Date in accordance with GAAP and on a basis



 

5 consistent with the accounting practices and policies used to prepare the
Balance Sheet, which shall include reasonably detailed documentation of the
Closing Date Cash Amount and the Final Net Working Capital Balance (the "
_Proposed Closing Balance Sheet_ ").



(iii) The Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Acquiror within thirty
days after receiving the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet a detailed
statement describing all of its objections (if any) thereto, including any
objection to the calculation of the Closing Date Cash Amount or the Final Net
Working Capital Balance, and sufficient details describing the basis therefor.
Failure of the Stockholder Representative to so object within such thirty day
period to the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet shall constitute acceptance
thereof, whereupon such Proposed Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed to be
the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_." All items on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet shall be determined and computed in accordance with GAAP and on a basis
consistent with and utilizing the same principles, practices and policies as
those used in preparing the Balance Sheet. Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative shall use reasonable commercial efforts to resolve any such
objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty days
after Acquiror has received the statement of objections, Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative shall select an internationally-recognized
independent accounting firm, other than their or Targets respective regular
independent accounting firms, mutually acceptable to them (the "
_Neutral Auditors_ ") to resolve any remaining objections. If Acquiror and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to agree on the choice of Neutral
Auditors, they shall select as Neutral Auditors an internationally-recognized
accounting firm by lot (after excluding their and Targets respective regular
independent accounting firms). The Neutral Auditors shall determine, within
sixty days after their appointment, whether the objections raised by the
Stockholder Representative are valid. The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and
documentation of the Closing Date Cash Amount and the Final Net Working
Capital Balance contained therein that is the subject of such objections by
the Stockholder Representative shall be adjusted in accordance with the
Neutral Auditors determination and, as so adjusted, shall become the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and documentation of the Closing Date Cash Amount and
the Final Net Working Capital Balance. Such determination by the Neutral
Auditors shall be conclusive and binding upon Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative. Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall share
equally the fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditors.



(f) If the Net Consideration Adjustment is less than zero, then the
Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Net
Consideration Adjustment (expressed as a positive number), which amount (the "
_Downward Adjustment_ ") shall be paid as follows:



(i) as soon as practicable after the date on which the Net
Consideration Adjustment is finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.1,
the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Acquiror a schedule (the "
_Post-Closing Downward Adjustment Schedule_ ") setting forth next to each
Holders name an amount equal to that portion of the Downward Adjustment such
Holder is required to forfeit to Acquiror in accordance with this Article III
and on a basis consistent with the principles set forth in Appendix 3.1;



(ii) in the event that the Downward Adjustment is less than the Hold-
Back Amount, as soon as practicable after the date on which the Net
Consideration Adjustment is determined, the Stockholder Representative and
Acquiror shall deliver joint written instructions to the Paying Agent to pay,
within five Business Days after the date on which the Paying Agent receives
such instructions, (A) to Acquiror, by Wire Transfer, an amount equal to the
Downward Adjustment, and (B)(1) to each Stockholder, in accordance with the
instructions provided in such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal, an amount
as provided in Section 3.3(a)(iii), (2) to each Warrant holder, in accordance
with the instructions provided in such Warrant holders Letter of Transmittal,
an amount as provided in Section 3.5(b)(ii), and (3) to the Surviving
Corporation, by Wire Transfer, an amount as provided in Section
3.4(c)(iii)(A), which amount shall promptly be paid to the Option holders as
provided in Section 3.4(c)(iii)(B); and

 



 

6 (iii) in the event that the Downward Adjustment is greater than or equal to
the Hold-Back Amount, as soon as practicable after the date on which the Net
Consideration Adjustment is determined, the Stockholder Representative and
Acquiror shall deliver joint written instructions to (A) the Paying Agent to
pay to Acquiror, by Wire Transfer, within five Business Days after the date
on which the Paying Agent receives such instructions, an amount equal to the
Hold-Back Amount and (B) the Escrow Agent to release an amount of the Escrow
Funds, by Wire Transfer, within five Business Days after the date on which
the Escrow Agent receives such instructions, equal to the difference between
the Downward Adjustment and the Hold-Back Amount.



(g) If the Net Consideration Adjustment is greater than zero, then the Merger
Consideration shall be increased by an amount (the " _Upward Adjustment_ ")
equal to such excess, which amount shall be paid as follows:



(i) as soon as practicable after the date on which the Net Consideration
Adjustment is finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.1, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Acquiror a schedule (the " _Post-Closing_
_Upward Adjustment Payment Schedule_ ") setting forth next to each Holders
name (A) an amount equal to that portion of the Upward Adjustment such Holder
is entitled to receive in accordance with this Article III and on a basis
consistent with the principles set forth in Appendix 3.1 attached hereto, and
(B) an amount equal to that portion of the Hold-Back Amount attributable to
such Holder as set forth in Appendix 3.3, Appendix 3.4 and Appendix 3.5; and



(ii) Acquiror shall deliver to the Paying Agent, by Wire Transfer, within
five Business Days after receiving the Post-Closing Upward Adjustment Payment
Schedule, an amount equal to the Upward Adjustment, and Acquiror and
Stockholder Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Paying Agent to pay, within five Business Days after the date on which the
Paying Agent receives such instructions, (A) to each Stockholder, in
accordance with the instructions provided in such Stockholders Letter of
Transmittal, the amounts set forth next to such Stockholders name on the
Post-Closing Upward Adjustment Payment Schedule, (B) to each Warrant holder,
in accordance with the instructions provided in such Warrant holders Letter
of Transmittal, the amounts set forth next to such Warrant holders name on
the Post-Closing Upward Adjustment Payment Schedule, and (C) to the Surviving
Corporation, by Wire Transfer in immediately available funds, an amount equal
to the total of the amounts set forth next to the Option holders names on the
Post-Closing Upward Adjustment Payment Schedule, which amount shall promptly
be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the Option holders in accordance with
the amounts set forth next to each Option holders name on such schedule.



(h) If the Net Consideration Adjustment is equal to zero, then as soon as
practicable after the date on which the Net Consideration Adjustment is
finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.1, Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Paying Agent to

receives such instructions, (i) to each holder of Target Stock or Warrants,

holder as set forth in Appendix 3.3 and Appendix 3.5, respectively, and (ii)
to the Surviving Corporation, by Wire Transfer, an amount equal to the total
of the Hold-Back Amount attributable to the options as set forth in Appendix
3.4, which amount shall promptly be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the
Option holders in accordance with Appendix 3.4.



(i) The Paying Agent shall hold the Hold-Back Amount in an interest
bearing account (the " _Hold-Back Account_ ") and any interest earned, but
not previously distributed, shall be distributed, pro-rata, with the Hold-Back
Amount pursuant to the terms of this Article III. The Paying Agent shall
only disburse the Hold-Back Amount following its receipt of joint
instructions as set forth in this Article III. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Acquiror shall have the right to receive a
distribution from the Hold-Back Account on a periodic basis in an amount
equal to thirty-



 

7 seven percent of the interest earned on the Hold-Back Amount. Acquiror is
intended to be, and shall be treated as, the owner for Tax purposes of the
Hold-Back Amount and all of the items of income, deductions and credits
attributable to the Hold-Back Amount and shall be liable for and pay all Taxes
with respect to such amounts.



Section 3.2 _Capital Stock of Target Outstanding Immediately Prior to
Effective Time_.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger
Sub, Target, Acquiror or the holders of any securities of Target, each share
of Target Stock, other than any Dissenting Shares and shares of capital stock
of Target that are owned by Target as treasury stock (which shares of treasury
stock will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange therefor), will be cancelled and extinguished and will
be converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.3, a portion of the
Merger Consideration, calculated pursuant to the terms of the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Target effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time and in accordance with Appendix 3.1 and Appendix
3.3.



(b) At and after the Effective Time, each holder of Target Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Stockholder_ ," and collectively, the
" _Stockholders_ ") shall cease to have any rights in respect of such shares
and such Stockholders rights shall be solely to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration for which such shares of Target Stock may be exchanged
pursuant to Section 3.2(a) above; _provided_ that the rights of Dissenting
Stockholders shall be as set forth in Section 3.6. The amounts paid by the
Paying Agent on behalf of Acquiror in exchange for the surrendered
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Target Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall be deemed to
be full payment and satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Target Stock. At the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Target Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive cash in accordance with Section 3.3.



Section 3.3 _Surrender of Certificates; Payments to Stockholders_.



(a) At or after the Closing, each Stockholder who has not previously executed
and delivered to Acquiror a Stockholder Consideration Consent shall deliver to
the Paying Agent a Stockholder Consideration Consent, duly executed by such
Stockholder and surrender for cancellation the Certificates that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented his, her or its shares of Target
Stock together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal, in form and substance customary for transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Upon surrender by a Stockholder of
such stock Certificates (or Affidavit of Loss) and delivery of such
Stockholder Consideration Consent, the Letter of Transmittal and such other
documentation as may reasonably be required by Acquiror or the Paying Agent
(collectively, the " _Stockholder Materials_ "), such Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to that
portion of the Merger Consideration for which such shares of Target Stock may
be exchanged, which shall be payable as follows:



(i) as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Paying
Agent of the Stockholder Materials, the Paying Agent shall pay to such
Stockholder, in accordance with the instructions provided by such Stockholder
in his, her or its Letter of Transmittal, the amount set forth next to such
Stockholders name on Appendix 3.3 under the heading "Closing Stock Payment;"



 

8 (ii) with respect to each Indemnifying Stockholder, such Stockholder hereby
acknowledges that the amount set forth next to his, her or its name on
Appendix 3.3 (as the same may be updated pursuant to Section 3.1(d)) under the
heading "Stockholder Escrow Obligation" (the " _Stockholder Escrow Obligation_
") shall be delivered by Acquiror to the Escrow Agent on behalf of the
Indemnifying Stockholders, to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, in lieu of paying such amount to him, her or it in
respect of the Merger Consideration payable to him, her or it, and that the
payments set forth in clause (i) of this Section 3.3(a) together with the
delivery of his, her or its Stockholder Escrow Obligation to the Escrow Agent,
shall be full consideration for the Target Stock surrendered by such
Stockholder;



(iii) in the event of a Downward Adjustment that is less than the Hold-Back
Amount, Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the
Paying Agent the joint written instructions called for in Section 3.1(f)(ii)
to pay to each Stockholder, in accordance with the instructions provided by
such Stockholder in his, her or its Letter of Transmittal, within five
Business Days after the date on which the Paying Agent receives such
instructions, the amount set forth next to such Stockholders name in such
instructions, which amount shall be equal to (A) the amount set forth next to
such Stockholders name on Appendix 3.3 under the heading "Stockholder Hold-
Back Amount" _minus_ (B) the amount set forth next to such Stockholders name
on the Post-Closing Downward Adjustment Schedule;



(iv) in the event of an Upward Adjustment, the Paying Agent shall make a
payment to such Stockholder as set forth in Section 3.1(g)(ii); and 



(v) in the event that the Net Consideration Adjustment is equal to zero, the
Paying Agent shall make a payment to such Stockholder as set forth in Section
3.1(h).



(b) All Certificates surrendered pursuant to Section 3.3(a) shall be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate representing shares
of Target Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed for all corporate purposes on and after the Effective Date to evidence
only the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration (without
interest) for which such shares of Target Stock have been so converted. No
payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration will be made to any
Stockholder pursuant to Section 3.3(a) until such Stockholder delivers his,
her or its Stockholder Materials to the Paying Agent in accordance with
Section 3.3(a). In the event any Certificates evidencing shares of Target
Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Stockholder thereof shall
(i) make and execute an affidavit of that fact and indemnification agreement,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror (" _Affidavit of
Loss_ "), indemnifying Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent against any claim that may be made against Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) deliver such Affidavit of Loss
to the Paying Agent in lieu of surrendering such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates.



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered
(a " _Transferee_ "), in addition to the other terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Transferee requesting such payment will have
paid to Acquiror or any agent designated by it any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Transferee, or established to
the satisfaction of Acquiror or any agent designated by it that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.3,
neither the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto
shall be liable to any holder of shares of



 

9 Target securities for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which shares of
Target Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such shares in respect
of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of Acquiror or its successors or assigns, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.



Section 3.4 _Surrender and Cancellation of Options; Payments to Option
Holders_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall take such actions as may be
necessary to require that (i) all Options be surrendered and cancelled as of

the Merger Consideration, calculated in accordance with Appendix 3.1 and (ii)
each Option holder duly execute an option cancellation acknowledgment, in

to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration as described in this Section
3.4 in respect of such cancelled Option and shall have no further rights with
respect to such Option.



(c) At the Closing, Target, on behalf of each Option holder, shall deliver a
duly executed Option Cancellation Acknowledgment to Acquiror. Upon delivery of
a Option Cancellation Acknowledgment, each Option holder who has duly
executed such Option Cancellation Acknowledgment shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to that portion of the Merger
Consideration to which the Option holder is entitled, which shall be payable
as follows:



(i) as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, (A) the Paying Agent
shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation, by Wire Transfer, an amount equal
to the total of all amounts set forth next to the Option holders names on
Appendix 3.4 under the heading "Closing Option Payments," and (B) the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to each such Option holder, within five
Business Days after the date on which the Paying Agent delivers the amount

under the heading "Management Stockholder Escrow Obligation," (the "
_Management Stockholder Escrow Obligation_ ") shall be delivered by Acquiror
to the Escrow Agent on behalf of each Management Stockholder, to be held by
the Escrow Agent in the Management Escrow in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, in lieu of paying such amount to him or her in respect of the
Merger Consideration payable to him or her, and that the payments set forth
in clause (i) of this Section 3.4(c), together with the delivery of his or her
Management Stockholder Escrow Obligation, shall be full consideration for the
cancelled Options of such Management Stockholder. In accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, upon release of the Escrow Fund (A) the Escrow
Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation (or its successor), by Wire
Transfer, the portion of the Escrow Fund that is allocable to the aggregate
amount of all Management Stockholder Escrow



 

10 Obligations that remain as a part of the Escrow Fund and (B) the Surviving

within five Business Days after the date on which the Escrow Agent delivers
the amount pursuant to clause (A) above, the portion of the applicable
Management Stockholder Escrow Obligation received from the Escrow Agent; 



(iii) in the event that the Downward Adjustment is less than the Hold-Back
Amount, (A) Acquiror and Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the

to deliver to the Surviving Corporation, by Wire Transfer, an amount equal
to the total of all amounts set forth next to the Option holders names on

Option until an Option Cancellation Acknowledgment is received from such
Option holder. The parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith the payment
date of the Hold-Back Amount as necessary to cause the Hold-Back Amount to
meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and applicable IRS guidance.



Section 3.5 _Surrender and Cancellation of Warrants; Payments to Warrant

Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into, or represent the right to receive, any portion of
the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 3.1. Such Holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraisal value
of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that, if any Holder of Dissenting Shares
(a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such Holders dissenters rights under the
DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such Dissenting Shares shall automatically be cancelled, extinguished
and represent only the right to receive that portion of the Merger
Consideration as set forth in Section 3.1, without interest or dividends
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.



(b) Target shall give Acquiror (i) prompt written notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by Target pursuant to the DGCL and any other notice or

not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demand for appraisal.

Merger Consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any
other costs or expenses (including specifically, but without limitation,
attorneys fees, costs and expenses in connection with any action or
proceeding or in connection with any investigation) in respect of any
Dissenting Shares (together, " _Dissenting Share Payments_ "), Acquiror



 

12 shall be reimbursed the amount of such Dissenting Share Payment from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Article X. 



Section 3.7 _Appointment of Paying Agent_.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(i), any funds deposited by
Acquiror with the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Acquiror. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation, and no part

any of the instruments evidencing securities of Target for the benefit of the
Holder thereof.



(b) Promptly following the later of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective

laws), (B) instruments evidencing Target securities, and (C) other documents
in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and the

without any interest thereon, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.7,
neither the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any party hereto
shall be liable to any holder of Target securities for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
any Holder properly perfects its appraisal rights, the pro rata portion of the
Merger Consideration that would otherwise be payable to such Holder for such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 3.3(a)(i) shall be returned to
Acquiror by the Paying Agent.



(d) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent
to deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable in connection
with this Agreement to any Holder such amounts as it is required pursuant to
Applicable Law to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes; _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
promptly pays when due such amount deducted and withheld to the appropriate
Governmental Authority for the account of such Holder. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.



Section 3.8 _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Target Companies, the directors and officers of Target and
Acquiror are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.



 

13 ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF TARGET



Except as otherwise disclosed to Acquiror in a schedule delivered to Acquiror
by Target and the Indemnifying Stockholders prior to the execution of
this Agreement (with specific reference to the representations and warranties
to which the information in such schedule relates) (the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ "), Target hereby represents and warrants as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing to both Acquiror and Merger Sub as follows:



Section 4.1 _Corporate Power_. Target has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to be performed by it. This Agreement has
been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by Target and is the legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Target enforceable against Target in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, or other laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights in general, and except that the
enforceability of this Agreement is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).



Section 4.2 _No Violations_. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.2, neither the
execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement by Target nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to be performed by it,
nor the compliance by Target with any of the terms or provisions hereof will
contravene or violate (a) any Applicable Law or Permit to which any Target
Company is subject, (b) any judgment, order, writ, injunction, or decree of
any court, arbitrator, or Governmental Authority or agency that is applicable
to any Target Company, or (c) the charter or organizational documents of any
Target Company; nor will such execution, delivery, or performance (i) violate,
be in conflict with, or result in the breach of, any Material Contract or
give any party with rights thereunder the right to terminate, cancel, or
accelerate the rights or obligations of any Target Company thereunder, (ii)
cause any acceleration of the maturity of any material note, instrument or
other obligation to which any Target Company is a party or by which any Target
Company is bound or with respect to which any Target Company is an obligor or
guarantor or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any
Encumbrance (other than any Permitted Encumbrance) of any kind whatsoever
upon or give to any other Person any interest or right (including any right of
termination or cancellation) in or with respect to any of the properties,
assets, business, agreements or contracts of any Target Company, except in
the case of clause (iii) above as could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. Except (a) as may be required pursuant
to applicable Antitrust Laws, (b) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or (c) as set forth in
Schedule 4.3, no authorization, approval, or consent of, and no registration
or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to be made or obtained
by any Target Company in connection with the execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement by Target. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.3,
no consent of, payment to or notice to any party to any contract to which
either Target Company is a party or under which the Target Companies or any of
their assets are bound or affected is required in connection with the valid
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or the consummation of any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby.



Section 4.4 _Corporate Existence_. Each Target Company is a corporation, duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Each Target Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, other than



 

14 such Permits, the lack of which could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Target Company
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned
or leased by it or the nature of the business transacted by it requires it to
be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. 



Section 4.5 _Capitalization_. Schedule 4.5 sets forth each Target Company,
its jurisdiction of formation, its authorized capital stock or other equity
interests, the amount as of the date of this Agreement of its outstanding
capital stock or other equity interests and the record owner(s) of its
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.5, there are no shares of capital stock of or equity interests in
any Target Company. The Indemnifying Stockholders beneficially own directly
or indirectly 100% of the issued and outstanding Series C and Series D
Preferred Stock of Target and approximately 97% of the issued and outstanding
Common Stock of Target, assuming conversion of all outstanding shares of
Series D Preferred Stock at a conversion rate of six shares of Common Stock
for each share of Series D Preferred Stock, but not assuming any exercise of
outstanding Options. Without taking into account the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each share of Series D Preferred Stock of Target is
convertible into six shares of Common Stock of Target. Schedule 4.5 sets forth
the number of shares of Target Stock (a) reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of options or warrants, (b) reserved for future issuance and (c)
issued and held in treasury. None of the Target Stock is held by Subsidiary.
All of the Target Stock and all of the outstanding capital stock or other
equity interests of Subsidiary have, to the extent applicable, been
duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and are
owned of record (and, with respect to Subsidiary, beneficially) by the record
owners set forth in Schedule 4.5, and, with respect to the shares of capital
stock of Subsidiary, are owned free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances, restrictions on transfer, claims, or options, other than
Permitted Encumbrances. Schedule 4.5 sets forth for each Target Company all
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, or other rights, calls or
commitments to issue, or any obligations or commitments to purchase, any
authorized capital stock or other equity interest or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any of the authorized capital stock or
other equity interest of each Target Company, including the names of holders
of such rights and the exercise prices thereto. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.5, (i) there are no outstanding or authorized stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or other equity based
compensation or similar rights (other than stock options) with respect to any
Target Company, and (ii) there are no voting trusts, proxies, or other
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of the capital stock
of the Target Companies. There are no declared or accrued but unpaid dividends
with respect to the Target Stock.



Section 4.6 _No Subsidiaries_. Other than Subsidiary, there are no
corporations or other legal entities in which any Target Company
owns, directly or indirectly, any equity or ownership interest.

sheet of the Target Companies (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") as of May 31, 2005 and
the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-
month period then ended (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "). Except
as set forth in Schedule 4.7(a), the Financial Statements have been prepared
in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (subject to normal
year-end adjustments and, in the case of any unaudited Financial Statements,

respects, the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results
of operations as of the date thereof and for the period indicated of the
Target Companies.



 

15 (b) The Financial Statements were prepared from the books and records of the
Target Companies, which have been maintained in accordance with sound
business practices and all applicable legal requirements and reflect all
financial transactions of the Target Companies which are required to be
reflected in accordance with GAAP. The Target Companies maintain accurate
books and records reflecting their assets and liabilities and maintain a
system of proper and adequate internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the Target Companies in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for the consolidated assets of the Target Companies, (iii)
access to the assets of the Target Companies is permitted only in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization; (iv) the reporting of the
assets of the Target Companies is compared with existing assets at regular

license or lease all of the rights, properties and assets that are used or
held for use in or necessary for the conduct or operation of the business as
presently conducted of the Target Companies and all such tangible assets are
operating in the ordinary course of business subject to normal maintenance and
repair. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.8, the Target Companies have good
and valid title to all of their assets and properties, real, personal, and
mixed, in each case free and clear of liens, pledges, security interests, and
other encumbrances of every kind, except for (a) liens for Taxes and
assessments not yet due and payable, (b) liens for Taxes, assessments, and
other charges, if any, the validity of which is being contested in good faith
by appropriate action and for which adequate reserves have been provided on
the Balance Sheet, (c) liens of employees and laborers for current wages not
yet due, and (d) restrictions not materially affecting the present use of
such assets or properties (collectively, the " _Permitted Encumbrances_ ").



Section 4.9 _Accounts Receivable_. All trade accounts receivable reflected,
and notes receivable included in, the Financial Statements (the " _Accounts
Receivable_ ") represent bona fide sales actually made or services actually
delivered in the Ordinary Course of Business and, in the case of Accounts
Receivable, have been billed or invoiced in the Ordinary Course of Business.
Except to the extent expressly reserved against or reflected on the Financial
Statements, the Target Companies know of no reason why such Accounts
Receivable would not be collectible in the Ordinary Course of Business.



Section 4.10 _Real Property_.



(a) Neither Target Company owns, or has ever owned, any real property. 



(b) Schedule 4.10(b) sets forth all leases of real property, occupancy

Property, the landlord thereof, the approximate square footage leased and the
nature of the activities conducted on such Leased Real Property. Target has
made available to Acquiror true, correct and complete copies of each Real
Property Lease. With respect to the Real Property Leases, (i) to the Knowledge
of Target, there exist no defaults under the Real Property Leases by
the Target Companies and neither Target Company has received written notice
of any such defaults and (ii) to the Knowledge of Target, there exist no
defaults by any third party thereunder. Each Real Property Lease is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of either Target Company, and, to the Knowledge
of Target, each other party thereto, enforceable against each such other party
thereto in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally and subject to



 

16 general principles of equity. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(b), the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in any default, penalty, right to terminate, increase in the amounts
payable under or modification to any Real Property Lease.



(c) None of the Leased Real Property is subject to any right or option granted
by the Target Companies in favor of any Person (other than the Target
Companies) to purchase or otherwise obtain title to such property, (i) to the

Leased Real Property, or applied for any change to the zoning or land-use
status of any Leased Real Property, (vi) to the Knowledge of Target, the
landlord named on each of the Real Property Leases set forth in Schedule

monetary encumbrances, and (vii) to the Knowledge of Target, there are no

ARTICLE VII  COVENANTS



Section 7.1 _Confidentiality and Announcements_.



(a) Except as provided below in this Section 7.1, none of the parties hereto,
nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall publicly disclose the execution,
delivery or contents of this Agreement other than (i) with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, or (ii) as required by any Applicable
Law, the applicable rules of any stock exchange, or any Governmental
Authority upon prior notice to the other parties hereto. Acquiror and Target
shall agree with each other as to the form, timing and substance of any press
release or public disclosure related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that (x) such agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (y) nothing contained herein shall
prohibit Acquiror or Target, following notification and consultation with the
other party, from making any such disclosure if required by any Applicable
Law, the applicable rules of any stock exchange or any Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.1, after
receipt of prior written consent of Acquiror (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), Target shall be permitted to disclose the existence of
this Agreement (but not the terms or provisions) to (A) those of its
customers, suppliers and sales representatives with whom Target has entered
into a non-disclosure agreement and (B) those third parties whose consent is
required as set forth in Schedule 9.1(e).



(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that from and after the date hereof,
each of Acquiror and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Target, the
Indemnifying Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative, on the other
hand, shall keep confidential all information (whether in oral or written
form, electronically stored or otherwise) received by the other party that is
related in any way to the proposed Merger, this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the other transactions



 

31 contemplated hereby (collectively, " _Confidential Information_ "); _provided_
that any Confidential Information that (i) was or becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the party receiving
the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement, (ii) was or
becomes available to a party on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the party disclosing the Confidential Information or its members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, partners, agents or advisors
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that such
source was not bound by any agreement or obligation to keep such information
confidential or (iii) was independently developed by the party receiving the
Confidential Information or its Representatives without reference to the
Confidential Information, shall not be subject to the restrictions contained
in this Section 7.1(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, a party may disclose the Confidential Information to
its Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information to
evaluate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents, are informed of its confidential nature, and agree to abide by this
Section 7.1(b). In the event that a party or any of its Representatives is
required by Applicable Law, regulation, supervisory authority or other
applicable judicial or governmental order to disclose any of the Confidential
Information, Acquiror and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Target, the
Indemnifying Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative, on the other
hand, shall provide the other party with prompt written notice, unless notice
is prohibited by law, of any such request or requirement so that the other
party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, failing the
entry of a protective order (which the party required to disclose will use its
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain), the party required to disclose
the Confidential Information is, in the opinion of its counsel, compelled to
disclose such Confidential Information, such party may disclose that portion
of the Confidential Information that counsel advises that such party is
compelled to disclose and will exercise reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain assurance to the extent possible that confidential treatment will be
accorded to that portion of the Confidential Information that is being
disclosed. In any event, the party required to disclose the Confidential
Information will use its reasonable commercial efforts to, and will not oppose
action by the other party to, obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
the Confidential Information. The parties obligations under this Section 7.1
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.



Section 7.2 _Expenses_. Regardless of whether any or all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, Acquiror and Target shall each bear their
respective direct and indirect expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including legal, accounting, brokerage and
other fees and expenses; _provided_ that the Closing Acquisition Expenses
shall be paid by Target out of Targets cash immediately prior to the Closing.



Section 7.3 _Regulatory Matters; Third Party Consents_. 



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable. Acquiror and Target shall cooperate with each other and (i) shall

necessary documentation, and to effect all registrations, applications,
notices, petitions and filings, with each Governmental Authority that are

as promptly as practicable any Permit of such Governmental Authority that is
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

use their reasonable commercial efforts promptly to prepare and to file all
necessary documentation, and to effect



 

32 all registrations, applications, notices, petitions and filings, with each
third party (other than a Governmental Authority) that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(ii) shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable any Permit of such third party that is necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(c) Acquiror and Target shall have the right to review in advance, and shall
consult with the other party on, and consider in good faith the views of each
other, in each case subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to Target or Acquiror, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Affiliates, that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority or any
other third party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of any Permit of a Governmental Authority or
other third party necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party shall keep the other apprised of
the status of obtaining any such Permit. The party responsible for any such
filing shall promptly deliver to the other party evidence of the filing of
all applications, filings and registrations relating thereto, and any
supplement, amendment or item of additional information in connection
therewith. The party responsible for a filing shall also promptly deliver to
the other party a copy of each notice, order, opinion and other item of
correspondence received from or sent to any Governmental Authority by such
filing party in respect of any such application, notice, petition, filing or
registration. In exercising the foregoing rights and obligations, Acquiror
and Target shall act reasonably and promptly.



(d) Acquiror and Target shall, upon the request of the other party, promptly
furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary in connection with any statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Acquiror and/or Target to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (except to the extent that such information would be, or
relates to information that would be, filed under a claim of confidentiality).



(e) Acquiror and Target shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval
is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any requisite regulatory approval will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.



(f) _HSR Act_.



(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Acquiror
and Target shall make an initial filing of notification and report form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
within five Business Days after the date hereof. Acquiror and Target shall
promptly furnish each other (or their counsel) all such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of the necessary filings or submissions under the HSR Act.
Acquiror and Target shall supply promptly any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Acquiror
and Target shall promptly provide each other (or their counsel) with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications, including file memoranda
evidencing telephone conferences with representatives of the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
or other Governmental Authorities or members of their respective staffs, with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Notification and  



 

33  Report Form or communications regarding the same. Acquiror shall bear the
filing fee associated with any HSR Act filings made pursuant to this
Section 7.3(f).



(ii) Each of Target and Acquiror shall use its reasonable commercial efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Target and Acquiror shall cooperate and use its reasonable commercial efforts
to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an " _Order_ "), that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger or any such other transactions, unless Target and Acquiror shall agree
in writing that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of
Target and Acquiror shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to take such
actions as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. Target and
Acquiror shall take any and all of the following actions to the extent
necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any Applicable Law regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby: (A) entering into negotiations; (B)
providing information required by law or governmental regulation; and (C)
substantially complying with any second request for information pursuant to
the Antitrust Laws.



(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither
Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to
make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to Orders providing
for the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets
of Acquiror, any of its Affiliates or the Target Companies, or the holding
separate of shares of capital stock of the Target Companies or imposing or
seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of Acquiror or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates to own, retain, use or operate any of its
products, services, properties or assets (including equity, properties or
assets of the Target Companies) or any limitation on the ability of the Target
Companies to own, retain, use or operate any of their products,
services, properties or assets or seeking a disposition or divestiture of any
such properties or assets.



Section 7.4 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing, without
additional consideration, each party hereto will (or, if appropriate, cause
its Affiliates to) execute and deliver such further instruments and take such
other action as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the other party or
otherwise required to make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents and to provide the other party with
the intended benefits of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

actual knowledge of any facts or circumstances which would require such a

and Acquiror shall promptly notify Target and the Stockholder Representative,

(a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Target

Written Consent_ "), duly and validly executed by each of the Indemnifying

Affiliate of Acquiror to give credit for employment with Target or Subsidiary
prior to the Closing Date to the extent relevant under Acquirors employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements and permitted by Applicable Law;
_provided_ that nothing herein shall require Acquiror or its Affiliates to
grant credit to the



 

37 extent that such credit would result in an accrual of benefits for periods
prior to the Closing Date or in a duplication of benefits. After the Closing,
Acquiror agrees, for the purposes of providing group medical, health and
hospitalization benefits, to give or cause to be given credit toward the
current calendar year limits in Acquirors plans for deductible and co-
payment amounts paid by employees of Target and Subsidiary under similar plans

Date, Acquiror shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to all individuals who are employees of Target and Subsidiary at the
Closing Date and whose employment will continue following the Closing Date
(the " _Assumed Employees_ ") with base salary and employee benefits
(excluding equity compensation) that are, in the aggregate, comparable to the
Assumed Employee and his or her covered dependents, where applicable, as those
in effect with Target or Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation will cause all (i) pre-existing
conditions and proof of insurability provisions for all conditions that all
Assumed Employees and their covered dependents have as of the Closing Date and
(ii) waiting periods under each plan that would otherwise be applicable to
newly hired employees to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied
under Targets plans.



(c) Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation will give each Assumed Employee
credit, for purposes of Acquirors and the Surviving Corporations vacation
and other paid leave benefit programs, for such employees accrued and unpaid
vacation and paid leave balance as of the Closing Date as set forth in
Schedule 7.9(c).



(d) Nothing expressed or implied herein shall confer upon any past or present
employee of Target or its subsidiaries, or his or her representatives,
beneficiaries, successors and assigns, nor upon any collective bargaining
agent, any rights or remedies of any nature, including, any rights to
employment or continued employment with Acquiror, Target or any of
their successors or Affiliates; nor shall Acquiror, Target or their
Affiliates be precluded or prevented from terminating or amending any Benefit
Plan.



Section 7.10 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Immediately prior to, and
conditioned on the consummation of, the Closing, Target shall cause to be
terminated (a) the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated February 28, 2003
by and among Target and the parties thereto, (b) the Investor Rights
Agreement, dated February 28, 2003 by and among Target and the parties
thereto, (c) the Shareholders Agreement, dated February 28, 2003, by and
among Target and the parties thereto, (d) the Stock Repurchase Agreement,
dated February 3, 2005 by and among Target and the parties thereto and (e) all

Stockholders to the extent that such agreements are still in effect.



Section 7.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. From and after the
Effective Time and for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) will, and Acquiror will cause the
Surviving Corporation (or any successor) to, fulfill and honor in all
respects, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the indemnification
obligations of the Target Companies for any Action arising out of or
pertaining to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time that may be instituted by any Person (" _Covered Claims_ ") owed to each
Person who is or was a director or officer of Target or Subsidiary, as
applicable, at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _Directors and Officers_
") pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the charter and bylaws of
the Target Companies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that, in the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue to disposition of any and all such claims. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Acquiror shall



 

38 obtain and, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the
sixth anniversary thereof, maintain and not take any steps to prospectively
or retrospectively cancel, buy out or remove any of the Directors and Officers
as additional named insureds from, a directors and officers liability
insurance policy providing coverage to the Directors and Officers at the same
levels as currently maintained by the Target Companies. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and Subsidiary
(following the Effective Time) will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification for Covered Claims that are at least as
favorable to the indemnified parties thereunder as those contained in the
charter and bylaws of the Target Companies as in effect on the date hereof,
which provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Date in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights of individuals who, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
were indemnified parties thereunder, except as required by Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Acquiror shall not
be required to pay more than $75,000 in the aggregate to obtain such insurance
coverage. It is agreed and understood that in the event such coverage cannot
be obtained for $75,000 or less in the aggregate, Acquiror shall be obligated
to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such $75,000 aggregate amount.
This Section 7.11 is for the benefit of the Directors and Officers and
is binding on Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
successors and assigns and will be enforceable by the Directors and Officers
as third party beneficiaries hereof.



Section 7.12 _No Solicitation_.



(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Target shall not, nor shall Target authorize or permit any of its
respective officers, directors or employees to, and shall cause any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other representatives of
Target retained by Target not to: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage (including
by way of furnishing information), or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate or induce (directly or indirectly) any inquiry with respect to, or
the making, submission or announcement of, any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a proposal or offer for an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information with respect
to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal (including any proposal or offer to Targets
stockholders) that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or recommend against the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
transaction contemplated thereby.



(b) Within two Business Days after receipt by Target (or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives) of
an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry
that Target reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, Target
shall provide Acquiror with oral and written notice of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a
copy of all written materials provided in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. Upon receipt of the Acquisition Proposal,

ARTICLE VIII  TAX MATTERS __



Section 8.1 _Tax Returns, Payments and Related Matters_.



(a) Target shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Target Companies which are due on
or before the Closing Date. Target shall prepare such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the prior practices of the Target Companies unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law.



(b) Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Target Companies for all Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are due after the Closing Date.
Acquiror shall (i) prepare such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
prior practices of the Target Companies, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, and (ii) provide such Tax Returns to the Stockholder
Representative for review and comment at least thirty days prior to their
filing due date, but not sooner than ten days after the Closing Date. The
Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Acquiror within ten days after
receiving such Tax Return a detailed statement describing all of its
objections (if any) thereto and sufficient details describing the basis
therefor. Failure of the Stockholder Representative to so object to such Tax
Return shall constitute acceptance thereof. Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative shall use reasonable commercial efforts to resolve any such
objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within five days after
Acquiror has received the statement of objections, Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative shall select Neutral Auditors to resolve any
remaining objections. The Neutral Auditors shall determine, within ten days
after their appointment, whether the objections raised by the Stockholder
Representative are valid. Determination of the Neutral Auditors shall be
conclusive and binding upon Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Acquiror shall be
entitled to file such Tax Return no later than on the due date of such Tax
Return. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 10.3 to the contrary,
Acquiror shall be entitled to make prompt claim against, and



 

41 shall be entitled to prompt payment from, the Escrow Fund for an amount equal
to the Taxes that would be due with respect to any such Tax Return (giving
effect to resolution of any objections by the Stockholder Representative in
accordance herewith), if such Taxes were determined without taking into
account any deduction, or reduction in Taxes, attributable to (x) the accrual
or payment of all or any portion of the Option Award Amount or (y) any Option
Exercise, but only to the extent (i) such Taxes (excluding any deferred Taxes)
are not reflected in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital Balance
(ii) with respect to Medicare payroll taxes arising in connection with the
Option Award Amount or any Option Exercise, such Taxes are in excess of
$780,000 and (iii) such Taxes have not been otherwise received or recovered
pursuant to Article X. 



(c) Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Target Companies for all Tax periods
that begin on or before, and end after, the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "). Acquiror shall (i) prepare such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the prior practices of the Target Companies, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law, and (ii) provide such Tax Returns to the
Stockholder Representative for review and comment at least thirty days prior
to their filing due date. The Stockholder Representative shall deliver to
Acquiror within ten days after receiving such Tax Return a detailed statement
describing all of its objections (if any) thereto and sufficient details
describing the basis therefor. Failure of the Stockholder Representative to
so object to such Tax Return shall constitute acceptance thereof. Acquiror and
the Stockholder Representative shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution
within five days after Acquiror has received the statement of objections,
Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall select Neutral Auditors to
resolve any remaining objections. The Neutral Auditors shall determine, within
ten days after their appointment, whether the objections raised by the
Stockholder Representative are valid. Determination of the Neutral Auditors
shall be conclusive and binding upon Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Acquiror shall be entitled to file such Tax Return no later than on the due
date of such Tax Return. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 10.3 to
the contrary, Acquiror shall be entitled to make prompt claim against, and
shall be entitled to prompt payment from, the Escrow Fund for an amount equal
to the Taxes payable with the filing of any such Tax Return (giving effect to
resolution of any objections by the Stockholder Representative in accordance
herewith) that are attributable to the portion of the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date as determined in accordance with Section 8.1(d), but only to the
extent (i) such Taxes (excluding any deferred Taxes) are not reflected in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital Balance (ii) with respect to
Medicare payroll taxes arising in connection with the Option Award Amount or
any Option Exercise, such Taxes are in excess of $780,000 and (iii) such Taxes
have not been otherwise received or recovered pursuant to Article X.



(d) With respect to any Straddle Period, for the purpose of determining each
partys liability in respect of Taxes hereunder, (i) any income, franchise,
gains, receipts and similar Taxes shall be allocated between the period that
ends on the Closing Date and the period that begins on the following day by
treating the Closing Date as the last day of such Tax period ( _i.e._ , the
parties hereto shall "close the books" on such date, and shall elect to do so
if permitted by Applicable Law); _provided_ that such Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
without taking into account any deduction, or reduction in Taxes, attributable
to (A) the accrual or payment of all or any portion of the Option Award
Amount or (B) any Option Exercise and (ii) other Taxes, imposed on a periodic
basis, shall be apportioned between the period that ends on the Closing Date
and the period that begins on the following day on a per diem basis;
_provided_ that such Taxes apportionable to the portion of the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined without taking into account any
deduction, or reduction in Taxes, attributable to (x) the accrual or payment
of all or any portion of the Option Award Amount or (y) any Option Exercise.



 

42 (e) All contracts, agreements or arrangements under which the Target Companies
may at any time have an obligation to indemnify for or share the payment of
or liability for any portion of a Tax (or any amount calculated with reference
to any portion of a Tax) shall be terminated with respect to the Target
Companies as of the Closing Date and the Target Companies shall thereafter be
released from any liability thereunder.



(f) Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall, and shall each cause
their Affiliates to, provide to the other cooperation and information, as and
to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the filing of any Tax
Return or in conducting any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes.



(g) All transfer, documentary, real property transfer, stock transfer,
recording, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes incurred in connection
with this Agreement shall be paid by Acquiror when due. Acquiror will, at its
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, real property transfer, stock transfer, recording, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes, and if required by Applicable Law, the
Indemnifying Stockholders will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.



(h) Neither Acquiror nor the Target Companies shall file or cause to be filed
an amended Tax Return for any Target Company with respect to any Tax
period beginning before the Closing Date without the written consent of the
Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed); _provided_ that Acquiror and the Target Companies may file any
such amended Tax Returns without the consent of the Stockholder
Representative to the extent, but only to the extent, such amended Tax Returns
are being filed in order to claim any carryback of a loss or other Tax item
relating to the payment or accrual of any portion of the Option Award Amount
or any Option Exercise ( _i.e._ , such amended Tax Returns shall not reflect
any changes to the Tax Returns they amend other than claiming the carryback
and reflecting any correlative adjustments arising from the carryback).



(i) Any refund of Taxes (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto, a " _Tax Refund_ ") with respect to any Target Company for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date resulting
from (i) any deduction, or reduction in Taxes, attributable to (A) the
accrual or payment of all or any portion of the Option Award Amount or (B) any
Option Exercise or (ii) any carryback of any loss or other Tax item from a Tax
period (or any portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, shall be
the property of Acquiror and the Target Companies and shall not be the
property of any Stockholder; any other Tax Refund with respect to any Target
Company for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be the property of the Stockholders. To the extent any Tax
Refund is received by any party to this Agreement or any Affiliate of such
party that is designated the property of another party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of such party pursuant to the terms hereof, then the Person
receiving the Tax Refund shall promptly pay over such Tax Refund to the Person
entitled to the Tax Refund after deducting therefrom any Taxes incurred by the
paying Person with respect to the receipt or accrual of such Tax Refund.



(j) Neither Acquiror nor any of it Affiliates (including the Target
Companies) shall make the election under Section 338(g) of the Code with
respect to either Target Company.

(the " _Threshold Amount_ "), whereupon the Indemnified Party may claim
indemnification for the total amount of such claims; _provided_ that no party
hereto may recover in the aggregate an amount greater than $27,000,000 (the "
_Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Threshold Amount and Cap shall not apply to (i) Losses arising out of fraud,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation of a party hereto or (ii)
indemnification claims under Section 10.1(b)(ii) or Section 10.2(b).



(b) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Article X with respect to or for: punitive damages or for lost
profits, consequential, exemplary or special damages. Any Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification pursuant to Article X on account of any Losses will
be (i) reduced by all insurance or other third party indemnification proceeds
available to the Indemnified Party, (ii) reduced by the amount of the net Tax
benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss and
(iii) increased to the extent necessary such that after payment of any net Tax
cost by the Indemnified Party with respect to the receipt or accrual of
indemnity payments hereunder as increased pursuant to this clause (iii), the
amount remaining shall be the amount of the indemnity payment prior to any
increase pursuant to this clause (iii). For purposes of the preceding clause
(iii), net Tax cost shall mean the net Tax cost that would actually be
incurred by the Indemnified Party had there been no deduction, or reduction in
Taxes, attributable to (A) the accrual or payment of all or any portion of
the Option Award Amount or (B) any Option Exercise.



(c) The Indemnified Party shall promptly, upon delivering a claim for Losses
hereunder, provide the Indemnifying Party all information and documentation
necessary to support and verify the claim asserted.



(d) If any Actions are instituted or any claim or demand is asserted by
any third party in respect of which a party may seek indemnification from an
Indemnifying Party hereunder pursuant to the provisions of this Article X, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
such third party claim or demand to be made to the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against any such third party claim or demand. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party within ten calendar days after the date on
which the



 

49 Indemnifying Party receives notice of the third party claim or demand made on
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of the third party claim or demand, then the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend such third party claim or demand with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion
or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
this Section 10.3(d). In such circumstances, the Indemnifying Party shall
defend any such third party claim or demand in good faith and have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not
compromise or settle any such third party claim or demand without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any third party claim or demand, and
the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation; _provided_ that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense or settlement with separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party if in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnified Partys counsel a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly control any
Tax claim with respect to a Straddle Period and shall not settle or compromise
such claim without mutual written consent. The Parties shall cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation, and settlement of
any such Action, claim or demand.



(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
10.3(d), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be
reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense as and when incurred (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in regard to the third party claim
or demand with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such
circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such third party claim
or demand in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise
or settlement of such third party claim or demand if indemnification is to be
sought hereunder, without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



(f) If an Indemnifying Party becomes obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Party hereunder, such Indemnifying Party shall pay to such
Indemnified Party within three Business Days after becoming so obligated the
amount to which such Indemnified Party shall be entitled; _provided_ that if
the Indemnified Party is an Indemnified Acquiror Party, it shall first seek
payment of the amounts to which it may become entitled hereunder from the
Escrow Fund, but only to the extent that the Escrow Fund is then being held by
the Escrow Agent. In the event of payment to an Indemnified Acquiror Party
from the Escrow Fund, within three Business Days from the date on which such
Indemnified Acquiror Party became entitled to such portion of the Escrow Fund,
Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent as to (i) the amount of funds, if any, to be
disbursed from the Escrow Fund and (ii) instructions as to the manner in which
such funds shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent.



(g) Except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation, in connection with an alleged breach of
Section 7.7, an Indemnified Acquiror Party may only assert, to the extent
permitted hereunder, an indemnification claim under Section 10.1(b)(i) for the
breach of the applicable representation or warranty to which such alleged
breach of Section 7.7 relates.



 

50 (h) For purposes of this Article X, to the extent that an Indemnified Acquiror
Party asserts any claims hereunder, all notices or other communications
related to such claims shall be directed to the Stockholder Representative in
accordance with Section 12.10.



Section 10.4 _Survival Period_. The rights of each party hereto to seek
indemnification pursuant to this Article X shall survive until the Escrow
Release Date, other than (a) Losses related to Section 10.1(b)(iv) or Section
10.1(b)(v) or claims based on a breach of Section 4.19 (Taxes), which shall
survive until the Final Escrow Release Date or (b) Losses related to Section
10.1(b)(ii) or fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation,
which shall survive indefinitely; _provided_ that if notice of an
indemnifiable claim is provided within the applicable time periods specified
above, the right to indemnification hereunder shall remain in full force and
effect until the final resolution thereof.



Section 10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims or Losses (a) relating to
fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, (b) related to
Section 10.1(b)(ii), (c) Post-Closing Acquisition Expenses, (d) the Net
Consideration Adjustment or (e) as otherwise provided in Sections 8.1(b) and
(c), the indemnification remedies provided in this Article X shall constitute
the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto after the Closing for any claim for
any Losses resulting from a breach of any party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. Except
as otherwise set forth herein, claims against the Escrow Fund pursuant to
this Article X constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Acquiror Parties against the Indemnifying Stockholders for any Losses
hereunder, except for claims or Losses of an Indemnified Acquiror Party (i)
arising out of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation or
under Section 10.1(b)(ii) (other than claims or Losses based on a breach of
Section 7.1 (Confidentiality and Announcements), Section 7.13 (Non-
Solicitation of Employees) or Section 7.14 (Non-Competition)), as to which
Indemnifying Stockholders shall be liable to the Indemnified Acquiror Party
for amounts in excess of the Escrow Fund on a joint and several basis and
(ii) under Section 7.1 (Confidentiality and Announcements), Section 7.13 (Non-
Solicitation of Employees) or Section 7.14 (Non-Competition), as to which the
breaching Indemnifying Stockholder shall be severally, and not jointly,
liable to the Indemnified Acquiror Party for amounts in excess of the Escrow
Fund. Any Losses satisfied from the Escrow Fund in respect of a claim made
pursuant to Section 10.2 shall reduce each Indemnifying Stockholders pro-
rata share of the Escrow Fund.



Section 10.6 _Release of Escrow Fund_. In accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the following amounts shall be released
from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholder Representative at the times
indicated for disbursement to the Indemnifying Stockholders in accordance
with their respective pro-rata share thereof: (a) on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, an amount, if any, equal to $12,000,000 minus any portion of
the Escrow Fund (i) subject to pending claims, (ii) due and owing, (iii)
previously paid to any Indemnified Acquiror Party and (iv) previously paid
pursuant to Article VIII; (b) on the Escrow Release Date, an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the Escrow Fund minus any portion of the Escrow
Fund (A) subject to pending claims and (B) due and owing over (ii) $5,000,000;
and (c) on the Final Escrow Release Date, the Escrow Fund minus any portion of
the Escrow Fund (i) subject to pending claims and (ii) due and owing. Any
remaining portion of the Escrow Fund will be released from the Escrow Fund to
the Stockholder Representative for disbursement to the Indemnifying
Stockholders promptly upon resolution of any pending claims. The parties
hereto agree to negotiate in good faith the structure and terms of the Escrow
Agreement as it relates to the Management Escrow, as necessary to cause the
Management Escrow to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
applicable IRS guidance.

 



Section 10.7 _Treatment_. For Tax purposes, all indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Article X, other than payments made from the Escrow Fund,
shall be treated by the parties hereto as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law. 



 

51 ARTICLE XI  TERMINATION



Section 11.1 _Termination_.



(a) This Agreement may be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date only as
follows:



(i) by mutual written consent of Acquiror and Target;



(ii) at the election of either Acquiror or Target, if the Closing Date
shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 P.M. Eastern time on October 10,
2005; _provided_ that (A) no party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(a)(ii) if such partys failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the primary cause of the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and (B) if the sole
reason that the parties hereto have not closed this transaction as of October
10, 2005 is that the required approval from the United States Department of
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other antitrust Governmental
Authority whose consent is required prior to the Closing has not been
obtained, then neither Acquiror nor Target may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1(a)(ii) until January 9, 2006;



(iii) by either Acquiror or Target if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such order, decree, ruling or other Action shall have become final and
nonappealable;



(iv) by Acquiror if Acquiror is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of Target or the
Indemnifying Stockholders contained in this Agreement such that the conditions
set forth in Sections 9.1(a), or (b) would not be satisfied and such breach
has not been cured within fifteen calendar days after written notice thereof
to Target and the Stockholder Representative; _provided_ that no cure period
shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured; or



(v) by Target if Target and the Indemnifying Stockholders are not in material
breach of their obligations under this Agreement and there has been a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of Acquiror
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.2(a) or (b) would not be satisfied and such breach has not been
cured within fifteen calendar days after written notice thereof to Acquiror;
_provided_ that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its
nature cannot be cured.



(b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by the delivery of
a written notice of such termination from the party terminating this Agreement
to the other party.



Section 11.2 _Obligations upon Termination_. Except in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(iv) or (v), (in which event, in
addition to as provided in clause (a) and (b) below, Article X shall survive)
in the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 11.1,
all obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement shall terminate
and there shall be no liability of any party hereto to any other party except
(a) as set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2, and Article XII, and (b) that
nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement.



 

52 ARTICLE XII  GENERAL



Section 12.1 _Amendments; Extension; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be
amended, altered or modified except by written instrument executed by
Acquiror, the Stockholder Representative, and Target.

contemplated hereby, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to an Article or
Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are

Section 12.6  _Binding Effect; Persons Benefiting; No Assignment_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly
provided in Article X and Section 7.11, nothing in this Agreement is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon any entity or Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any part
hereof. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of Acquiror (in the case of an assignment by Target) or
the Stockholder Representative and Target (in the case of an assignment by
Acquiror).



Section 12.7  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (delivery of which may occur via facsimile), each of which shall
be binding as of the date first written above, and, when delivered, all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile signature or
electronically scanned copy of a signature shall constitute and shall be
deemed to be sufficient evidence of a partys execution of this Agreement,
without necessity of further proof. Each such copy shall be deemed an
original, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to
produce or account for more than one such counterpart.



  

54 Section 12.8 _No Prejudice_. The parties hereto acknowledge that the terms and
language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations among the parties
and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this
Agreement shall be resolved against any particular party. Any controversy over
construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of
authorship or negotiation.



Section 12.9 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all
matters arising out of or relating hereto, including its validity,
construction and interpretation, shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to the laws as to choice or conflict of laws,
except to the extent that the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of a
party shall govern its internal corporate affairs. Each party to this
Agreement, by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in
Wilmington, Delaware, for the purpose of any action, claim, cause of action or
suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation
arising out of or related to this Agreement, (b) to the extent not prohibited
by Applicable Law, hereby waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as
a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject
to the personal jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution by reason of a lack of personal
jurisdiction, that any such proceeding brought in one of the above-named
courts is improper by reason of a lack of personal jurisdiction or venue, or
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such court by reason of a lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, and
(c) hereby agrees not to commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit
(in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation arising
out of or related to this Agreement other than before one of the above-named
courts, nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending
to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of action or
suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation to
any court other than one of the above-named courts. Each party hereby
consents to and accepts service of process in any such proceeding in any
manner permitted by Delaware law or if served pursuant to Section 12.5.



Section 12.10 _Stockholder Representative_.



(a) With respect to the Indemnifying Stockholders, by virtue of
their execution of this Agreement and with respect to the other Stockholders,
by virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite
vote of the Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have
agreed to appoint LLR Partners Inc. as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the
Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders, in each case
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby:



(i) to give and receive notices and communications,



(ii) to receive funds and give receipts therefor,



(iii) to receive service of process with respect to any claim under
this Agreement,



(iv) to agree to, negotiate, execute and deliver agreements, documents and
instruments,



(v) to authorize payments of amounts from the Escrow Fund and the Hold-Back
Amount pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,



(vi) to object to such payments,



 

55 (vii) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to such claims,



(viii) to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any
Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against any Indemnified Party or any
dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder, and



(ix) to take or refrain from taking all other action, and execute and deliver
all additional agreements, documents, certificates and instruments, as
the Stockholder Representative may deem necessary or appropriate in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less
than ten calendar days prior written notice to Acquiror; _provided_ that
the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless two-thirds interest
of the Stockholders agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may
be filled by the affirmative vote of two-thirds interest of the Stockholders.
No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the
Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for his
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Stockholders.



(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Stockholders for
any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting
in good faith and in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Stockholders shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholder Representative. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including to an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1, shall
constitute a decision of the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Stockholders; and Acquiror may conclusively and
absolutely, rely, without any inquiry, upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders. Acquiror is hereby relieved from
any liability to any Person, including any Stockholder, for any acts done by
it in accordance with or reliance on such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative. Nothing contained in this
Section 12.10 shall modify, alter, amend or otherwise release the Indemnifying
Stockholders from their indemnification obligations to Acquiror under this
Agreement.



(c) All notices or other communications required to be made or delivered
by Acquiror to the Stockholders shall be made to the Stockholder
Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders and any notices so made
shall discharge in full all notice requirements of Acquiror to the
Stockholders with respect thereto. 



Section 12.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT
OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CIVIL ACTION IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR
BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE



 

56 TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS
SECTION 12.11 CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THEY ARE RELYING
AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS
RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 12.11 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.
