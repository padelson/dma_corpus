into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, whereby (i) each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_
") (other than any portion of the Rollover Investments comprised of Company
Common Stock) not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company as of the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent as a result of the Merger.

Investors will contribute to Parent, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, the Rollover Investments and (ii) certain shareholders of the Company
have delivered to Parent and Merger Sub support agreements (the " _Support

of the Company have, among other things, agreed to support the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Support Agreements.

 

C. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders to enter into this
Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend the approval of this Agreement and
the principal terms of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company.

") is entering into a limited guaranty in favor of the Company (the "
_Guaranty_ ") with respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
under this Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1. Merger Transaction

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the CGCL, at the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consummate the Merger, whereby
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the CGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the _"Closing"_ )
shall take place at the offices of Cooley LLP, 1333 2nd Street, Suite 400,
Santa Monica, CA 90401, at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date to be designated by
Parent (the _"Closing Date"_ ), which shall be no later than the third
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions); _provided_ , that notwithstanding
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof, if
the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at such time), the Closing shall occur instead on (a) the
date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the
earliest to occur of (i) any business day during the Marketing Period
specified by Parent to the Company on no less than three business days
written notice to the Company and (ii) the next business day after the final
day of the Marketing Period, but subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 at such time (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such time) or
(b) such other date, time, or place as agreed to in writing by the Parties
hereto. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, an agreement of merger
satisfying Section 1101 of the CGCL shall be duly executed by the Company and
Merger Sub and the officers certificates of the Company and Merger Sub
required by Section 1103 of the CGCL shall be duly executed by the Company and
Merger Sub, respectively. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing, such

 



2  agreement of merger and officers certificates shall be delivered to the
Secretary of State of the State of California for filing. The Merger shall
become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such agreement of
merger and officers certificates with the Secretary of State of the State of
California (the _"Effective Time"_ ).

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

 

(a) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit B;

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(c) the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall be the respective individuals who are serving as officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 

(d) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall be the respective individuals who are designated as directors by
written notice from Parent to the Company no later than two business days
prior to the Effective Time.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of
the Company:

 

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 1.5(b), each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding (other
than any Rollover Shares or Dissenting Shares, as defined below) shall be
converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash (the
_"Merger Consideration"_ ), without interest, subject to any withholding of

 



3  Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section
1.6(e), it being agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that all shares of
Company Common Stock (including Restricted Securities, if any) contributed to
Parent by the Rollover Investors (collectively, the " _Rollover Shares_ ")
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration; and 

(iv) each share of the common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

1.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the _"Paying
Agent"_ ) for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 1.5. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash
consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5 a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates evidencing such shares (the _"Certificates"_ ) shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender 

 



4  of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly
evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company

 



5  Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Legal Requirements.

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to
deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are
promptly and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any
withholding obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or
documentation to the applicable payor, such payor shall request
such information from such payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to
avoid such withholding obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or other
recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Section 1.

1.7 Dissenters Rights. Shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock
for fair market value in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL (the
_"Dissenting Shares"_ ) shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his or her right to dissent. If after the Effective Time such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to dissent,
each such share of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if it had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and less any amounts entitled to
be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1.6(e). The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands for purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate

 



6  in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

1.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties of the Company

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows
(it being understood that each representation and warranty contained in
Section 2 is subject to (a) exceptions and disclosures set forth in the part
or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the particular

forth in any other part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the
extent it is reasonably apparent from the wording of such exception or
disclosure that such exception or disclosure is intended to qualify such
representation and warranty; and (c) disclosure in the Company SEC Documents

(including the classification and compensation of employees for purposes of
the Fair Labor Standards Act and cognate state laws) and other Legal

Code Section 412, including any "single employer" defined benefit plan or any
"multiemployer plan" each as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA.

401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code, each such
Employee Plan has timely adopted all currently effective amendments to the
Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing

and (iv) performance by the Company of its obligations under Section 4.2, as
of the date hereof, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letter
and Debt Commitment Letter will, together with the contributions contemplated
by the Rollover Letters and not more than $20 million of the cash balances of
the Acquired Corporations, in the aggregate, be sufficient for Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (and any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity
Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay
all related fees and expenses. 

 



30  The Financing Letters and the Rollover Letters are in full force and effect
as of the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under
the Equity Funding Letter, the Rollover Letters or the Debt Commitment
Letter; provided that Parent is not making any representation or warranty
regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 2\. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not
have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will
not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or
Merger Sub on the date of the Closing or that any of the conditions to the
contributions contemplated in the Rollover Letters will not be satisfied or
that the contributions contemplated by the Rollover Letters will not be made
to Parent on or before the date of the Closing; provided that Parent is not
making any representation regarding the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2, or compliance by the Company with its
obligations hereunder. The Financing Letters contain all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein, and the Rollover Letters
contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make the contributions to Parent described therein. As of the
date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters, the Rollover
Letters and any customary engagement letter and non-disclosure agreements that
do not impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing.

3.10 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect to the
Transactions, including the Financing (as some or all of such Financing may
be amended or replaced in compliance with Section 5.12 hereof) and the payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, (c) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 2 hereof, (d) payments of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and (e) payment of all
related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Acquired Corporations will
be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of
the Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when
used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination
(a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will,
as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date and (ii) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on
its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date,
"an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses
in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" following such date, and
(c) such Person will be "able to pay its

 



31  liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature", in
each case, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors.

3.11 Certain Arrangements. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Contracts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or
written) or commitments to enter into agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) (a) between Parent, Merger Sub,
the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date
hereof that relate in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Transactions or (b) pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company would be
entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company
agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote
against any Superior Offer, other than, in each such case, the Rollover
Letters and the Support Agreements as in effect on the date hereof.

 

3.12 Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any, whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Parent.

SECTION 4. Certain Covenants of the Company

 

4.1 Access and Investigation. During the period from the date of this

reasonable advance notice to the Company, the Company shall, and shall cause
the respective Representatives of the Acquired Corporations to: (a) provide
Parent and Parents Representatives with reasonable access during normal

with all reasonably requested information regarding the business of the
Acquired Corporations, including copies of the existing books, records, Tax
Returns, work papers and other documents and information relating to the

data and information regarding the Acquired Corporations, as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that any such access shall be
conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company. Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information
to Parent if such disclosure would, in 

 



32  its reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege, (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including
any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or its Affiliates is a
party) or (iii) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does
not disclose information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall
provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such information and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable Legal
Requirements, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. Without
limiting the generality of this Section 4.1, from the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, the Company will furnish to the Parent promptly
upon written request by Parent (to the extent such items become available),
(i) monthly financial statements, including an unaudited balance sheet, income
statement and statement of cash flows for each month through the Closing
Date, (ii) any material update of its outlook for the quarter or the balance
of the fiscal year as it may prepare for managements internal use and (iii)
monthly same store results. With respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to this Section 4.1, Parent shall comply with, and shall cause
Parents Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement dated January 21, 2013, as amended, between the
Company and Sycamore Partners Management, L.L.C. (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

each of the Acquired Corporations conducts its business and operations in the
ordinary course and in substantially the same manner as previously conducted;
and (ii) the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (A) any knowledge of any
notice from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (B) any Legal Proceeding commenced, or, to its knowledge
threatened, relating to or involving any of the Acquired Corporations that
relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause each of the other
Acquired Corporations to, use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
intact the material components of their current business organization,
including keeping available the services of current officers and key
employees, and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain their
respective relations and good will with all material suppliers, material
customers, Governmental Bodies and other material business relations;
_provided, however,_ that the Acquired Corporations shall be under
no obligation to put in place any new retention programs or include
additional personnel in existing retention programs; _provided, further,
however,_ that so long as no agreement or covenant contained in this Section
4.2 is breached or violated, nothing in this Section 4.2 shall (in and of
itself) require the Acquired Corporations to maintain a specified level of
cash balances and marketable securities.

otherwise contemplated under this Agreement or as required by applicable

Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement that contains

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall not contain terms and
conditions similar to those contained in the first sentence of the last

reasonable best efforts to enforce the terms and conditions of any such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into by the Company, except
where such action could reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of
the Companys Board of Directors to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 4.3, the Company shall not and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries not to and shall not permit its

an Acquisition Proposal.

 



39 (c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Required Company Shareholder Vote, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or
group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on or after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this Section
4.3, (A) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group
of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Offer, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to (but only pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to Parent (i) an
unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal made in writing provided to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any financing commitments
(including any Redacted Fee Letters) relating thereto) and (ii) a written
summary of the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in
writing (including any financing commitments relating thereto). 

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within
48 hours) and upon the request of Parent shall reasonably inform Parent of the
status of such Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , that, the Company shall
not have any obligation to duplicate any notice provided under Section 4.3(c).
The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with this Section 4.3.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.3(e) or Section 4.3(f),

its shareholders that the Required Company Shareholder Vote be given (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") or fail to include the Company Board

modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a

 



40  manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) make any

pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (D) (1) fail to publicly
recommend against any publicly announced Acquisition Proposal (and reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation) within ten business days after Parent so

Proposal, Parent may only make two such requests or (E) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of
the Company, an Acquisition Proposal (actions described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle or any
Specified Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Required Company
Shareholder Vote is obtained, but not after, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, enter into a
Specified Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in
violation of this Section 4.3 or take any action pursuant to Section 7.1(f) if
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (x) that
failure to take such action could reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Legal Requirements and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Company
has given Parent at least four calendar days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall include an unredacted copy
of the Superior Offer, an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and a copy of any financing commitments (including Redacted Fee
Letters) relating thereto and a written summary of the material terms of
any Superior Offer not made in writing, including any financing commitments
relating thereto, in each case to the extent not previously provided pursuant
to Section 4.3(c) or 4.3(d)), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the
Rollover Letters and the Guaranty such that it would cause such Superior
Offer to no longer constitute a Superior Offer, (3) following the end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement, the Financing Letters,
the Rollover Letters and the Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent in a
manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and
shall have determined that the Superior Offer constitutes a Superior Offer if
such revisions were to be given effect and (4) in the event of any material
change to the material terms of such Superior Offer, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to Parent an additional 

 



41  notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above and the notice
period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least
two calendar days (rather than the four calendar days otherwise contemplated
by clause (1) above); and provided, that any purported termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect,
unless the Company termination is in accordance with Section 7.1 and, to the
extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3 prior to or concurrently with
such termination.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Required Company Shareholder Vote is obtained, but not after, the Board of
Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_ ") if the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action could reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors to the Companys shareholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that such action shall not be in
response to a Superior Offer (which is addressed under Section 4.3(e)) and
prior to taking such action, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company has
given Parent at least four calendar days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for taking
such action, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letters and
the Guaranty in such a manner that would obviate the need for taking such
action and (z) following the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this
Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letters and the Guaranty
proposed in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract
if accepted by the Company, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect a Change of Recommendation could reasonably constitute a
breach of fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements.

(g) Nothing in this Section 4.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any
disclosures permitted under this Section 4.3(g) that does not contain either
an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) making any disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable Legal Requirements;
_provided_ that making such disclosure under Section 4.3(g)(ii) shall not in
any way limit or modify the effect, if any, that any such action has under
Section 4.3.

 



42 SECTION 5. Additional Covenants of the Parties

 

5.1 Shareholder Approval; Proxy Statement.

(a) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, take all
action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements, the Companys
articles of incorporation and bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a
record date for (and the Company shall not change such record date without the
prior written consent of Parent), call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock to vote on the adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_"). The Company
shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the
Company Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements. Subject to Section 4.3, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Company Shareholder Vote. The
Company in its sole discretion may adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, and with Parents
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting or
(ii) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its
shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting even if the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or a Change of Recommendation.

 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the SEC and Parent shall timely
cooperate with and assist the Company in connection with the preparation of
the foregoing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or
its staff concerning the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after
the resolution of any such comments. Parent and Merger Sub will provide to the
Company upon request any information with respect to Parent and Merger Sub
and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates and agents required to be
provided in the Proxy Statement under applicable

 



43  Legal Requirements or as reasonably requested by the Company. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any other governmental officials and of any request by the SEC
or its staff or any other governmental officials for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other
governmental officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings
with respect to the Transactions (or, in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements, and the Company further agrees to cause the
Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if any such
correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

(c) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of the
Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting.

Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business
days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby; and shall use reasonable best efforts

44  Antitrust Laws) with respect to the Transactions; (iv) use reasonable best
efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance
is expressly provided for herein) to cause to be taken, on a timely basis,
all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and
effectuating the Transactions; and (v) use reasonable best efforts (unless,
with respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly
provided for herein) to promptly obtain all Consents from any Governmental
Body (other than those relating to Consents from Governmental Bodies under
Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above)
or, if requested by Parent, any third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.2,
during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Government Body or brought by a third party before
any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions, (ii)
keep the other Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly
inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any
other Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly furnish to the other
Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, with copies of documents
provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (other than "4(c)
documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act), (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult and cooperate with the other Parties and will consider in
good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in
respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto will permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. 

5.3 Stock Options; Restricted Stock; ESPP.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Board of
Directors of 

 



45  the Company or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company
Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding and otherwise) to (i) accelerate the vesting and exercisability
of each unexpired and unexercised Company Option then in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time so that each such Company Option shall
be fully vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time, (ii) terminate
each Company Equity Plan (except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder
thereof) and (iii) cause, as of the Effective Time, each unexpired and
unexercised Company Option then in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (and each plan, if any, under which
any Company Option may be granted except, with respect to any such plan, as
otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof) to be cancelled, terminated
and extinguished (in each case, without the creation of additional liability
(other than pursuant to any Tax withholding obligations and any employer Taxes
that become payable) to any Acquired Corporation, Parent and/or any of its
Affiliates), subject, if applicable, to payment pursuant to the immediately
following sentence. Upon the cancellation of each such Company Option as
described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence that has an exercise price
per share that is less than the per share Merger Consideration, the holder of
each such unexpired and unexercised Company Option, whether vested or
unvested, shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to such
cancellation, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax and without
interest) in cash, payable through the Surviving Corporations payroll system
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than
the second payroll period after the Effective Time), equal to the excess (if
any) of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per share of
each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (such
amount determined by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) in respect of such a
share of Company Common Stock subject to any such particular Option, the "
_Designated Consideration_ "); it being agreed that each unexercised Company
Option (with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration) shall be canceled at the Effective Time without consideration
therefor. The Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for ensuring
that applicable withholding Taxes and payroll Taxes are withheld and paid in
connection with payments of Designated Consideration under this Section 5.3(a)
in respect of such Company Options.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under
the Company Equity Plans pursuant to which Restricted Securities are
outstanding and otherwise) to (i) accelerate the vesting of each Restricted
Security granted and outstanding under the Companys Equity Plans as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time so that, with respect to each
Restricted Security, the Companys reacquisition right with respect thereto
shall lapse, and the vesting of each other Company Equity Award shall be
accelerated in full, and (ii) provide that each such Restricted Security shall
be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this
Agreement (except as otherwise agreed to by Parent (and/or any of its
Affiliates) and a holder thereof with respect to any Restricted Securities
that are Rollover Shares).

 



46 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to (i) ensure that no
offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement and (ii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering
period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause the
rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any such offering period
then underway under the ESPP to be determined by treating the last business
day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and
by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering
period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
under the ESPP. The Company shall terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective
as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that
are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
5.3(c).

5.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of the
Acquired Corporations who are actively employed by the Acquired Corporations
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively
employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof) during such
one year period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") base salary and base wages,
short-term cash bonus opportunities and benefits (excluding equity based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such base
salary and base wages, short-term cash bonus opportunities and benefits
(excluding equity based compensation) provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing:

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the applicable
Acquired Corporation.

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit
plans; _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this Section 5.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan 

 



47  at any time, and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any
such health or welfare benefit plan, then (upon expiration of any appropriate
transition period), the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate
in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit plans to the extent
that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an
Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any health
or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation,
then Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such
health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
allowances (including paid time off) but not for purposes of benefit accrual,
credit Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the
Acquired Corporations to the same extent that such service was recognized
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit
plan of the Company. Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be
"at will" employment.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.4 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no
current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 

5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Acquired Corporations existing in
favor of those Persons who are directors and officers of any Acquired
Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Acquired
Corporations (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided
in the indemnification agreements between the Acquired Corporations and said
Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the
forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger
and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent available under California law for a period of six years from
the Effective Time, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to
such indemnification rights within such six-year period shall continue to be
subject to this Section 5.5(a) and the indemnification rights provided under
this Section 5.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

 



48 (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together
with its successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and
hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified
Person as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation in connection
with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in
whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director
or officer of an Acquired Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and
pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with
respect to the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the
foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which
such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this
Section 5.5(b) within fifteen days after receipt by Parent of a written
request for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons
of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay
such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section
5.5(b).

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, the existing policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement (a true and correct copy of which has been made
available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are
currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors and officers of the Acquired Corporations (as applicable), on terms
with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the
existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time the Company may
(through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by Parent (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) purchase a
six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy effective as of the Effective
Time) and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be deemed to
satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this
Section 5.5(d); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250%
of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with respect to such
current policy, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount.

 



49 (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.5 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their heirs and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 5.5 may not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Effective Time in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their heirs without the
prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

5.6 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any securityholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and the right to consult
on the settlement with respect to such securityholder litigation, and the
Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

5.7 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and
make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party
to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if
any) required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the
Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement which, with
respect to Contracts, shall be limited to the Material Contracts (other than
Retail Store Leases) set forth on Schedule 5.7, (ii) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained
pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Material Contract by such
Party in connection with the Transactions which, with respect to Material
Contracts, shall be limited to the Material Contracts (other than Retail
Store Leases) set forth on Schedule 5.7, and (iii) shall use commercially

 



50  reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to
the Merger brought by any third Person against such Party. The Company shall
promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice
given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing
Period.

5.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press
release or otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement
to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
any of the other Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party
may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the
other Party), (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement as may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need
not consult with Parent in connection with any press release, public
statement or filing to be issued or made (including to Company Associates)
pursuant to Section 4.3(g) or with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or Change in Recommendation. 

5.9 Resignation of Directors. Other than with respect to any directors
identified by Parent in writing to the Company not less than two (2) business
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to obtain and deliver to Parent on or prior to the Effective Time the
resignation of the Companys directors.

 

5.10 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take such actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any
Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Company will give prompt notice to Parent (and will subsequently keep
the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to such
notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact,
event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to
result in any Material Adverse Effect with

 



51  respect to it and ( ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and/or 6.2 not being able to be satisfied
prior to the End Date. Parent will give prompt notice to the Company (and
will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any
developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence
or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and/or 6.3 not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date.

 

5.11 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Companys Board of Directors,
shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of
the Effective Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the deemed disposition and cancellation of shares of Company Common Stock
(including Restricted Securities) and Company Options in the Transactions
contemplated hereby by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions
and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

5.12 Financing.

(a)

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the
Financing Letters, and the contributions contemplated by the Rollover
Letters pursuant to the terms thereof, and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Financing Letters or the Rollover Letters if such amendment, modification or
waiver (A) with respect to the Financing Letters, reduces (or could have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless (x)
the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or
original issue discount and (y) after giving effect to any of the transactions
referred to in clause (x) above, the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 3.10 shall be true and correct) or, with respect to the Rollover
Letters, reduces the amount of Company Common Stock or Designated
Consideration to be contributed thereby unless (x) the Debt Financing or the
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount and (y) after giving
effect to any of the transactions referred to in clause (x) above, the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.10 shall be true and
correct as of the time of such transaction or (B) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the Financing or the contributions contemplated by the Rollover Letters, or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing
Letters or the Rollover Letters, in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing or
the 

 



52  contributions contemplated by the Rollover Letters (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing or the contributions contemplated by the Rollover
Letters) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto or the Rollover Letters, in each of clauses (x) and (y) in any
material respect (provided that, subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 5.12(a), Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and

or other arrangements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any

to the Merger, the Financing, the Rollover Investments and the other
Transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its controlled Affiliates to, enter into any merger, acquisition, joint

not a business day, the next business day), the Company pays the Termination
Fee due to Parent under Section 7.3(b);

 

(g) by Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred
that (i) except with respect to the covenants or obligations contained in
Section 4.3, (A) would cause a failure of the conditions in Section 6.2(a),
(b), (c), (d) or (e) to exist and (B) cannot be cured by the Company by the
End Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have commenced to have been
cured within 15 days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such

this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if either Parent or Merger Sub
is then in material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 not being satisfied;

 



64 (h) by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time, if a breach of
any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or

occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions in Section 6.3(a), (b)
or (c) to exist and cannot be cured by Parent by the End Date, or if capable
of being cured, shall not have commenced to have been cured within 15 days of
the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided, however_ , that, the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) if it is then in material
breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
6.1 or Section 6.2 not being satisfied; or

(i) by the Company, if (A) the Marketing Period has ended and the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been
satisfied, (B) the Company has irrevocably confirmed by notice to Parent
after the end of the Marketing Period that all conditions set forth in Section
6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied as of the date of such notice (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing) and, if there any unsatisfied conditions in Section 6.3 (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing) that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied
conditions in Section 6.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) and (C) the Merger shall
not have been consummated within three business days after the delivery of
such notice. 

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the
other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates following any
such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this Section 7.2, Section 7.3,
Section 8 and the expense reimbursement and indemnification provisions of
Section 5.12(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall
remain in full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms; (c) the Guaranty shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms; and (d) the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any Party from any liability for fraud prior to the date of

rights or remedies it may have under Section 8.5(b) in lieu of terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1.

 



65 7.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that:

(i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known (and not
withdrawn) after the date hereof and prior to the Company Shareholders
Meeting (or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there has been no
Company Shareholders Meeting), (B) the principal terms of this Agreement and
Merger have not been approved by the Companys shareholders at the Company
Shareholders Meeting prior to the termination of this Agreement, (C)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(e) (without the failure to close by the End
Date being primarily due to the failure of Parent to perform in all material
respects any of its obligations under this Agreement) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(g) and (D) within 12 months of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and such Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not the
Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause
(A) and whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was made before or after the
termination of this Agreement); _provided_ that for purposes of clause (C) of
this Section 7.3(b)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f);
or

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)
or (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Board of
Directors of the Company has made a Change of Recommendation;

then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
7.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
(less, if applicable, the Turn-Down Fee previously paid to Parent by the
Company) by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section
7.3(b)(iii), within two business days after such termination, (y) prior to or
on the same business day as (or, if the Specified Agreement is executed on a
day that is not a business day, the next business day) such termination if
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or (z) in the case of Section 7.3(b)(i), two
business days after the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
applicable Termination Fee on more than one 

 



66  occasion. As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $21,000,000. In the event that Parent or its designee shall receive
full payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and Section 7.3(d), together
with reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to Section 7.3(f), the
receipt of the Termination Fee, the Turn-Down Fee and the expenses referred to
Section 7.3(f) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 7.3(b) shall limit the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub under Section 8.5(b).

(c) In the event that:

(i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h); or

 

(ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i);

 

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.3(c), if the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(g) has been satisfied, then Parent shall
pay to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds, within two business
days after such termination, a termination fee of $42,000,000 (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the
event that Company shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(c),
together with indemnification pursuant to Section 5.12(b) and reimbursement
of any applicable expenses pursuant to Section 7.3(f), the receipt of the
Reverse Termination Fee together with such expenses shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
the Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing Letters, the Rollover Letters or the Guaranty (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and
the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letters or the
Guaranty, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

 



67 (d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for its
actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to exceed
$4,500,000 (the " _Turn-Down Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the second business day following the date of such
termination of this Agreement; provided, that the existence of circumstance
which would require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Turn-Down Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3(d); and
provided, further, that the payment by the Company of the Turn-Down Fee
pursuant to this Section 7.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b)
except to the extent indicated in Section 7.3(b).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the Companys rights set forth in Section 8.5(b) and the reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 5.12(b) and Section
7.3(f) hereof, the Companys right to receive payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee from Parent or the Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranty in
respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the
other Company Related Parties against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors, the
parties to the Rollover Letters, the Financing Sources of the Debt Financing
or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, financing sources, managers, members, directors,
officers or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for
any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment
of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
but subject to Section 8.5(b) and the reimbursement obligations of the Company
under Section 7.3(f), Parents right to receive payment from the Company of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b)and the Turn-Down Fee pursuant
to Section 7.3(d), in each case, in accordance with the terms thereof, shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, optionholders, managers,
members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) under no circumstances will the
Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Reverse
Termination Fee (and any indemnification pursuant to Section 5.12(b) and
Section 7.3(f)) and (2) while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with Section 8.5(b) and the payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee under Section 7.3(c), under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of the type contemplated by the preceding sentence and any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



68 (f) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to
obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a
Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the other Party, with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parties, with respect to the Company, for
the payment set forth in this Section 7.3, such paying Party shall pay the
other Party or Parties, as applicable, its reasonable and documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually received.
Except as provided in Section 7.3(f), payment of the fees and expenses
described in this Section 7.3 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parties in connection with any termination of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8. Miscellaneous Provisions

8.1 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to 5.5(e), this Agreement
may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of Directors of the
Company and Parent at any time (whether before or after the adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys shareholders); _provided, however_ , that after any
such adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, no amendment
shall be made which by applicable Legal Requirements requires further
approval of the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of
such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

8.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

 



69 8.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule
or in any certificate or schedule or other document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 

8.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements
and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the Parties (and, in the case of Parent and Merger
Sub, any of their Affiliates), with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof;  _provided, however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided, further,
that_ , if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This Agreement
may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF
shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

8.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
Section 8.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in
the State of California (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction
and venue set forth in this Section 8.5(a) shall not constitute general
consents to service of process in the State of California and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be
deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties hereto); (ii) if
any such action is commenced in a state court, then, subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, any Party may petition for the removal of such action to
any federal court located in California; and (iii) each of the Parties
irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party
is to receive notice in accordance with Section 8.9. The Parties hereto agree
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court
judgment.

 



70 (b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 8.5(a) without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in
Section 7.3 (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to
specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific performance is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the
Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with (A) enforcing Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (but not the right of the
Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies
for obligations other than with respect to the Equity Financings) shall be
subject to the requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all
conditions in Section 6.1 and 6.2 were satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the
time when the Closing would have been required to occur but for the failure of
the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii)(a) the Debt Financing (including
any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and
satisfies the conditions of, Section 5.12(a) of this Agreement) has been
funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance
with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing and (b) the Rollover Investments are made at Closing and (iii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are within its
control to cause the Closing to occur and (B) enforcing Parents obligation
set forth in Section 5.12 to cause the Debt Financing to be funded to fund the
Merger shall be subject to the requirement that (i) the Marketing Period has
ended and all conditions in Section 6.1 and 6.2 were satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at
Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur but
for the failure of the Debt Financing to be funded and (ii) all of the
conditions to the Debt Financing have been satisfied. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

 



71  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 8.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third- party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source, or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, New York, whether a state or Federal court, and that the provisions
of Section 8.5(d) relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim and any
such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim shall be
governed by the laws of New York.

 

(d) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(e) The Company, on behalf of itself and each of its Representatives,
shareholders, holders of Company Options and holders of any other Company
Equity Awards (collectively, the " _Seller Group_ " and each, a " _Seller
Group Member_ "), hereby waives and agrees not to assert against any
Financing Source or any of the respective former, current, or future
Affiliates or Representatives of the Financing Sources (collectively, the "
_Financing Group_ " and each a " _Financing Group Member_ "), any right or
claim for any and all losses, claims or liabilities suffered by any Seller
Group Member as a result of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or any breach of the other agreements contemplated hereby,
including the Debt Commitment Letter, by any Person in the Financing Group
party thereto, the failure of the Merger to be consummated or in any other
respect with respect to this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby (including the Debt Commitment Letter), and none of the Financing Group
Members shall have any further liability or obligation to any Seller Group
Member relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other agreements
contemplated hereby or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
under any theory or with respect to any claim, whether sounding in law or
equity. Without modifying or qualifying in any way the preceding sentence or
implying any intent contrary thereto, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall any Seller Group Member be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages
of any kind against any such Financing Group Member, including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with respect to,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including, any breach
by Parent or Sub), the

 



72  termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Legal
Requirement arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

8.6 Attorneys Fees. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce
this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing
party in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a sum for its
reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in such action or suit.

8.7 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without the
prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall
be void and of no effect; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Parent or
Merger Sub may (i) assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (provided
that such assignment shall not (A) affect the obligations of the Equity
Provider under the Equity Funding Letter, the Rollover Investors under the
Rollover Letters or any Guarantors under the Guaranty or (B) impede or delay
the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the
shareholders of the Company under this Agreement) and/or (ii) pledge its
rights hereunder as security to its Financing Sources; provided that no such
assignment or pledge permitted pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder.

8.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Effective Time occurs (A)
the right of the Companys shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration at
the Effective Time and (B) the right of the holders of Company Equity Awards
to receive the consideration set forth in Section 5.3 at the Effective Time;
(ii) the provisions set forth in Section 5.5 of this Agreement, (iii) the
rights of persons who are explicitly provided to be third party beneficiaries

Parties and the Company Related Parties set forth in Section 7.3(e) and (v)
the rights of Financing Sources and sources of debt financing for the
Transactions set forth in Sections 7.3(e) and Section 8.5.

8.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term
or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree
