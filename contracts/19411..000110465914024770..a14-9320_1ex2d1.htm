_Section 2.3_, the " **Final Closing Statement** "). Following the delivery
of such statement, Parents personnel and independent accountants shall
reasonably promptly (i) make available to the Sellers and the Sellers agents,

Proposed Calculations arising in the course of the review thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If, within forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the Final Closing
Statement, the Sellers dispute any aspect of any of Parents Proposed
Calculations, then the Sellers shall, on or prior to such forty-fifth (45th)
day, deliver to Parent written notice of such dispute (the " **Dispute
Notice** "). If the Sellers do not deliver a Dispute Notice to Parent on or
prior to such forty-fifth (45th) day after their receipt of Parents Proposed
Calculations pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, Parents Proposed Calculations as
reflected on the statement delivered by Parent shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Statement and shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and
such forty-fifth (45th) day shall be deemed to be the " **Determination
Date**." Any Dispute Notice shall be accompanied by the Sellers proposed
alternative calculations (the " **Sellers  Proposed Calculations**") of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Transaction Expenses. Parent and the
Sellers shall, for a period of thirty (30) days following Parents receipt of
the Sellers Proposed Calculations, cooperate in good faith to determine a
mutually agreeable Final Closing Statement, which shall be final and binding
upon the parties. The date upon which such Final Closing Statement is mutually
agreed to by Parent and the Sellers shall be deemed to be the "
**Determination Date**." If no such agreement is reached within such thirty
(30) day period, then within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of such
period, the Sellers and Parent shall select a mutually acceptable and
nationally recognized independent accounting firm, other than the Companys
independent accountants and Parents independent accountants (such firm, the "
**Independent Accounting Firm** ") to resolve the remaining disputed items
(the " **Remaining Disputed Items** ") within thirty (30) days of its
appointment, by (x) conducting its own review and test of the parties
respective proposals for the Final Closing Statement and thereafter selecting
either Parents Proposed Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or the
Sellers Proposed Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or an amount in
between the two and (y) delivering to Parent and the Sellers a revised Final
Closing Statement reflecting the Independent Accounting Firms final
determination of the Remaining Disputed Items pursuant to clause (x), which
Final Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.
The date on which the Independent Accounting Firm delivers such Final Closing
Statement shall be deemed to be the " **Determination Date**." The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Sellers, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in proportion to the relative
amount (in Dollars) such partys calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items
differ from the Independent Accounting Firms final determination of the
Remaining Disputed Items. The parties will submit such materials and respond
to such questions as requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. The
Independent Accounting Firms report will be based (to the extent the
Independent Accounting Firm considers it appropriate) on such information and
on the accounting and other records of the Company. The Independent Accounting
Firms award will consist solely of an award with respect to the Remaining
Disputed Items and will not include any other finding or award.

 



 

(c) The " **Adjustment Amount** ," which may be positive or negative, shall be
an amount equal to:

 



 

(i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3(b)_ above) _minus_ the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital, _minus_

 



 

(ii) the Transaction Expenses (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_ above) _minus_ the Estimated Transaction Expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then within five (5)
business days of the Determination Date, Parent shall pay an amount equal to
the Adjustment Amount to the Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_.

 



 

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then within five (5)
business days of the Determination Date, Sellers shall pay to Parent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by Parent
not less than two (2) business days prior to such date, the Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable after the beginning of the thirteenth (13th) month
following the Closing Date, Parent shall re-calculate the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, taking into account only post-Closing events through and
including the end of the twelfth (12th) month following the Closing Date
solely as they relate to customer accounts receivable that existed on the
Closing Date and the aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts with respect
thereto (the " **Re-Calculated Closing Date Net Working Capital** "). The
Sellers shall cooperate with Parent in determining a mutually agreeable figure
for the Re-Calculated Closing Date Net Working Capital. In the event of a
disagreement between Parent and the Sellers with respect to the Re-Calculated
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
appointed to resolve such disagreement in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.3(b)_, and the Independent Accounting Firms determination of the
Re-Calculated Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be final and binding on
the parties. The date on which the Re-Calculated Closing Date Net Working
Capital is finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.3(f),_ shall
be referred to herein as the " **Final Re-Calculation Date** ". The " **Re-
Calculated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount** ," which may be positive or
negative, shall be an amount equal to (i) the Re-Calculated Closing Date Net
Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)_)
minus (ii) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_). Notwithstanding the definition of Closing Date
Net Working Capital to the contrary, the Re-Calculated Closing Date Net
Working Capital shall take into account cash received after the Closing Date
in respect of customer accounts receivable included in the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital; _provided_ that any such cash received after
the Closing Date shall be retained by the Company and shall not be distributed
to the Sellers.

 



 

(g) If the Re-Calculated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive
number (such amount, the " **Re-Calculated Increase Amount** "), then promptly
following the Final Re-Calculation Date, and in any event within five (5)
business days of the Final Re-Calculation Date, Parent shall pay to the
Sellers an amount equal to the Re-Calculated Increase Amount in accordance
with _Section 2.9(a)_. If the Re-Calculated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such amount, the " **Re-
Calculated Deficit Amount** "), then promptly following the Final Re-
Calculation Date, and in any event within five (5) business days of the Final
Re-Calculation Date, Sellers shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an account designated by Parent not less than
two (2) business days prior to such date, the Re-Calculated Deficit Amount.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.4. _Escrow_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay a portion of the Adjusted Base
Amount equal to the Escrow Amount to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as escrow agent of the parties hereto (the " **Escrow Agent** "), to be held
in escrow. Such escrowed funds shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an Escrow Agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ with such changes as
requested by the Escrow Agent that are reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Seller Representative (the " **Escrow Agreement** ") and, together
with any earnings thereon (the " **Escrow Fund** "), shall be released in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any amount to be released from the Escrow Fund to the Sellers in
accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ and the Escrow Agreement shall be reduced by
(i) the Employee Portion of such release, which will be paid to Bonus
Employees in accordance with _Section 2.9_, _plus_ (ii) the aggregate amount
of any applicable hospital insurance (Medicare) tax imposed pursuant to
Section 3111(b) of the Code payable by Parent or its Affiliates with respect
thereto, _plus_ (iii) the aggregate amount of any applicable old-age,
survivors, and disability insurance (Social Security) tax imposed pursuant to
Section 3111(a) of the Code payable by Parent or its Affiliates with respect
thereto for any Bonus Employee not employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries on
the date of such payment. The parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to Parent an amount equal to the sum of the amounts specified clauses

Sellers.

insurance (Medicare) tax imposed pursuant to Section 3111(b) of the Code
payable by Parent or its Affiliates with respect thereto, _plus_ (iii) the

the 2014 CDMI Retained Rebates _minus_ Twenty-Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($27,500,000.00), _multiplied by_ (B) two and eighteen
hundredths (2.18) (such total amount, the " **2014 Retained Rebates Payment**
"); _provided, however,_ that (i) in no event shall the 2014 Retained Rebates
Payment exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) and (ii) if the 2014
Retained Rebates Payment is a negative number no Retained Rebates Payment
shall be made in respect of 2014. The 2014 Retained Rebates Payment shall be
satisfied in respect of amounts owing to Sellers and the Subscribing
Employees, solely through the vesting of Parent Shares pursuant to Section 4
of the Subscription Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _2015 Retained Rebates Payment_. Parent shall pay an amount equal to (A)
the Retained Rebate Amount _minus_ (B) the Traditional Rebate Reduction _plus_
(C) the Specialty Offset (such total amount, the " **2015 Retained Rebates

(i) The " **Retained Rebate Amount** " shall be equal to (A) the 2015 CDMI
Retained Rebates _minus_ Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00), _multiplied
by_ (B) six and one-half (6.5).

thousandths (3.824), _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
amount of the Specialty Offset exceed the amount of the Traditional Rebate
Reduction.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Section 2.5_ to the contrary, in
no event shall the 2015 Retained Rebates Payment exceed Sixty-Five Million
Dollars ($65,000,000.00) and if the 2015 Retained Rebates Payment is a
negative number no 2015 Retained Rebates Payment shall be made in respect of
2015. For purposes of clarity and as an illustration only, Exhibit 2.5(b) sets

July 1, 2016 (for the 2015 Retained Rebates Payment), Parent shall deliver to
the Sellers a statement (a " **Retained Rebates Payment Statement** ") that
sets forth in reasonable detail its determination of whether all or any
portion of the 2014 Retained Rebates Payment or the 2015 Retained Rebates

(ii) The Sellers may review the Retained Rebates Payment Statement during the
forty-five (45) day period commencing on the date that the Sellers receive

Statement (each, a " **Disputed Retained Rebates Payment Statement** "),
Sellers must, prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

end of such forty-five (45) day period, deliver a written notice to Parent (a
" **Notice of Retained Rebates Payment Disagreement** ") setting out their

Adjustments and to reach agreement in writing on all such Proposed Retained
Rebates Payment Adjustments.

 



 

(iii) If the Sellers are satisfied with the applicable Retained Rebates

Payment Disagreement with respect to the Retained Rebates Payment Statement
within the forty-five (45) day period specified in the first sentence of

(iv) If any of the Proposed Retained Rebates Payment Adjustments are not

Payment Statement Adjustments** ") within forty-five (45) days after Parents
receipt of a Notice of Retained Rebates Payment Disagreement, then the
Unresolved Retained Rebates Payment Statement Adjustments may be submitted at
the request of the Sellers or Parent to the Independent Accounting Firm or
another accounting firm mutually agreed by the parties (the " **Retained
Rebates Payment Neutral Auditor** ") for arbitration. The scope of the review
by the Retained Rebates Payment Neutral Auditor shall be limited to (A) a
determination of whether the portions of the applicable Retained Rebates
Payment Statement relating to such Unresolved Retained Rebates Payment
Statement Adjustments were prepared in accordance with the terms of this

clause (A), a statement of the adjustments (if any) to such Disputed Retained
Rebates Payment Statement that are necessary with respect to the Unresolved
Retained Rebates Payment Statement Adjustments in order to comply with the
requirements of this Agreement. The Retained Rebates Payment Neutral Auditor
shall not make, or be asked to make, any determination other than as set forth
in this _Section 2.5(c)(iv)_. The Sellers and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Retained Rebates Payment
Neutral Auditor to render its written decision resolving the matters submitted
to it as promptly as practicable after such submission of the Unresolved
Retained Rebates Payment Statement Adjustments. The fees and expenses of the
Retained Rebates Payment Neutral Auditor incurred pursuant to this _Section
2.5(c)(iv)_ shall be borne by the Sellers, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, in proportion to the relative amount (in Dollars) such partys
calculations differ from the Retained Rebates Payment Neutral Auditors final
determination.

 



 

(v) When the Retained Rebates Payment Statement is finally determined in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.5(c)(iv)_, the
Retained

 



      
 

 



 

Rebates Payment Statement as so agreed (or deemed agreed) or determined shall
be the " **Final Retained Rebates Payment Statement** " for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(vi) The Final Retained Rebates Payment Statement shall be final and binding
on the parties hereto, shall have the effect of an arbitral award and be used

accordance with this _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(vii) Prior to the end of 2016, Parent shall cause each of the Companys
Rebates to be accounted for separately in a manner sufficient to allow
Sellers, Parent or the Retained Rebates Payment Neutral Auditor, as the case
may be, to make an independent determination of the 2014 CDMI Retained

_Sections 2.7(c)(ii)_ and _2.7(c)(iii)_ (the " **Unresolved Gross Profit
Performance Payment Statement Adjustments** ") within forty-five (45) days
after Parents receipt of a Notice of Gross Profit Performance Payment
Disagreement, then the Unresolved Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement
Adjustments may be submitted at the request of the Sellers or Parent to the
Independent Accounting Firm or another accounting firm mutually agreed by the
parties (the " **Gross Profit Performance Payment Neutral Auditor** ") for
arbitration. The scope of the review by the Gross Profit Performance Payment
Neutral Auditor shall be limited to (A) a determination of whether the
portions of the applicable Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement relating
to such Unresolved Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement Adjustments were
prepared in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (B) based on its
determinations of the matters described in clause (A), a statement of the
adjustments (if any) to such Disputed Gross Profit Performance Payment
Statement that are necessary with respect to the Unresolved Gross Profit
Performance Payment Statement Adjustments in order to comply with the
requirements of this Agreement. The Gross Profit Performance Payment

 



      
 

 



 

Neutral Auditor shall not make, or be asked to make, any determination other
than as set forth in this _Section 2.7(c)(iv)_. The Sellers and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Gross Profit
Performance Payment Neutral Auditor to render its written decision resolving
the matters submitted to it as promptly as practicable after such submission
of the Unresolved Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement Adjustments. The
fees and expenses of the Gross Profit Performance Payment Neutral Auditor
incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.7(c)(iv)_ shall be borne by Sellers, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in proportion to the relative
amount (in Dollars) such partys calculations differ from the Gross Profit
Performance Payment Neutral Auditors final determination.

 



 

(v) When the Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement is finally determined
in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.7(c)(iv)_, the
Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement as so agreed (or deemed agreed) or
determined shall be the " **Final Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement**
" for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) The Final Gross Profit Performance Payment Statement shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto, shall have the effect of an arbitral award and
be used for determination of whether Parent must make a Gross Profit
Performance Payment in accordance with this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(vii) Prior to the end of 2015, Parent shall cause each of the Companys and
ICOREs revenues and costs (including Rebates) to be accounted for separately
in a manner sufficient to allow Sellers, Parent or the Gross Profit
Performance Payment Neutral Auditor, as the case may be, to make an
independent determination of the CDMI/ICORE Rebates Gross Profit.

 



 

Section 2.8. _References to Years_. As used in this _Article II_, each of the
terms "2013", "2014", "2015", and "2016" shall be deemed to refer to the
fiscal year of Parent ended December 31 of such year.

 



 

Section 2.9. _Method of Payment to Sellers; Employee Bonus Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Payments to Sellers_. All amounts required to be paid by Parent to the
Sellers pursuant to the provision of this _Article II_ shall be (i) paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by
the Sellers at least two (2) business days prior to the date on which such
payment is required to be made, _provided_ that, after the Closing, Parent
shall deliver funds to the account(s) designated for such Seller on the
immediately preceding payment date unless the Sellers timely designate
otherwise; and (ii) allocated among the Sellers in proportion to their Pro
Rata Share (as set forth on _Annex A_ ).

 



 

(b) _Employee Bonus Payments_. The percentage set forth next to the name of
each of the individuals specified on _Annex B_ (each, a " **Bonus Employee**
") is the " **Employee Percentage** " for such Bonus Employee. Before the
Closing, any Employee Percentage may be decreased to zero if such Bonus
Employees right to a Sale Bonus is forfeited in accordance with the terms of
such Bonus Employees Employment Agreement with the Company. In the event of

 



      
 

 



 

any such decrease, _Annex B_ shall be automatically and immediately deemed
amended to reflect such adjustment.

 



 

(c) _Calculation of Employee Portion and Timing of Payment_. For purposes of
this Agreement, the aggregate amount of all Employee Percentages shall be the
" **Total Employee Percentage** ", and the " **Employee Portion** " of any
applicable payment of a portion of the Purchase Price shall be calculated and
paid as follows:

 



 

(i) the Employee Portion of the Closing Date Adjusted Base Amount payable in
accordance with _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ shall equal the Total Employee
Percentage _multiplied by_ the Closing Date Adjusted Base Amount, and shall be
paid to Bonus Employees through payroll of the Company net of required
withholding on the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) the Employee Portion of any amount released from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with _Section 2.4_ of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
shall equal the Total Employee Percentage _multiplied by_ the aggregate amount
of such funds subject to release, and shall be paid to Bonus Employees through
payroll of Parent or its Affiliate net of required withholding within thirty
(30) days after such amount of the Escrow Fund is released to the Sellers;

 



 

(iii) the Employee Portion of the 2015 Retained Rebate Performance Payment
paid, if at all, in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_, shall equal the Total
Employee Percentage _multiplied by_ such Retained Rebate Performance Payment,
and shall be paid to Bonus Employees through payroll of Parent or its
Affiliate net of required withholding within thirty (30) days after such
payment is made to the Sellers;

 



 

(iv) the Employee Portion of the Conversion Performance Payments paid, if at
all, in accordance with _Section 2.6_, shall equal the Total Employee
Percentage _multiplied by_ the applicable Conversion Performance Payment and
shall be paid to Bonus Employees through payroll of Parent or its Affiliate
net of required withholding within thirty (30) days after such payment is made
to the Sellers; and

 



 

(v) the Employee Portion of the Gross Profit Performance Payments paid, if at
all, in accordance with _Section 2.7_, shall equal the Total Employee
Percentage _multiplied by_ the applicable Gross Profit Performance Payment,
and shall be paid to Bonus Employees through payroll of Parent or its
Affiliate net of required withholding within thirty (30) days after such
payment is made to the Sellers.

 



 

(d) _Individual Payment of Employee Bonus Payments_. Parent or its Affiliate
shall pay, at the time designated in _Section 2.9(c)_, each Bonus Employee an
amount in respect of each Employee Portion determined in accordance with this
Article II equal to (i) the Employee Portion _multiplied by_ (ii) the Employee
Percentage applicable to such Bonus Employee with respect to such Employee
Portion on the date the right to such payment arises hereunder. The total
amount received by a Bonus Employee in respect of all Employee Portions is
such Bonus Employees "Sale Bonus".

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _No Third Party Rights_. It is understood and agreed between the parties
hereto that all provisions contained in _Section 2.9_ and this _Article II_
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and do not
and shall not create any right in any other person, including any Bonus
Employee, any Specified Employee, or other interested parties.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Withholding_. Parent acknowledges that it does not intend,
based on applicable legal requirements as of the date of this Agreement and
subject to each Seller filing with the IRS a valid election under Section
83(b) of the Code with respect to all Parent Shares issued pursuant to the
Subscription Agreements entered into by Sellers, to withhold Taxes from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement except as expressly
contemplated hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such a payment under
applicable Tax law, provided that, excluding payments made to Bonus Employees,
before deduction or withholding is made, Parent shall give Sellers twenty (20)
days notice of the intention to make such deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and are paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority or other designated recipient, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Sellers or the Bonus Employees in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be. Any
withholding made by Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Escrow Agent, as
the case may be, in respect of the Employee Bonus Payments, together with the
employer share of any applicable employment taxes relating thereto, shall be
paid to the applicable Governmental Authority in all material respects in
compliance with applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) For United States federal, state and local income Tax purposes, the
Sellers and Parent agree that the Sale shall be treated under Revenue Ruling
99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2), (i) with respect to Parent, as a deemed
purchase of all of the assets of the Company, and (ii) with respect to the
Sellers, as a sale of their Interests.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price (including, without limitation, the Employee Bonus
Payments) (such amount, plus any additional amounts treated as consideration
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-1(c), the " **Allocable Purchase
Price** ") shall be allocated among the assets of the Company. Such allocation
shall be made in accordance with the allocation principles set forth in
_Schedule 2.11(b)_ (the " **Allocation Principles** ") the requirements of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(c) No later than one hundred twenty (120) days immediately following the last
day of the Companys fiscal quarter in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers its determination of the allocation
of the Adjusted Base Amount (plus any additional amounts treated as
consideration under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-1(c) paid at Closing)
pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_ and the Allocation Principles (the "
**Allocation Schedule** "), for Sellers review and approval. If, within
thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Allocation Schedule, Sellers
notify Parent in writing that Sellers dispute any item reflected in the
Allocation Schedule, Parent and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve such

 



      
 

 



 

dispute. Should Parent and Sellers fail to reach an agreement within thirty
(30) days after Sellers notify Parent of such dispute, the determination of
the disputed item or items shall be made by the Independent Accounting Firm.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall make its determination in accordance
with the principles and requirements of _Section 2.11(b)_. Neither Parent nor
any Seller shall take any position (whether in connection with audits, Tax
Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with this _Section 2.11_ and the
agreed Allocation Schedule, except as may be required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar
provision of state, local or non-United States Tax law).

 



 

(d) The Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustments to
the Purchase Price made pursuant to this Agreement (including as a result of
the Retained Rebates Payments, Conversion Performance Payments or Gross Profit
Performance Payments, if any) applying _Section 2.10(b)_ and the methodology
used in the initial Allocation Schedule as agreed pursuant to _Section
2.10(c)_.

for the Company to take such action described in this clause (o) need not be
in writing to be effective; or

 



 

(p) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



 

Section 6.2. _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc_.

 



 

(a) Neither the Company nor the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companys
officers, Managers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
**Representatives** ") to not, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
cause, facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing

be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding any Takeover Proposal or
(iii) enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(b) The Company or the Sellers shall promptly notify Parent, orally and in

proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations (or continuation of
discussions or negotiations) are sought to be initiated with, the Company or

inquiry, request or other contact and the terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries, requests or other contacts
(and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received
from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry,
request or other contact).

or (C) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,

Section 6.3. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
6.3(d)_ ), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable and to consummate the Transactions, including preparing and filing
promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents

 



      
 

 



 

(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions. For
purposes hereof, " **Antitrust Laws** " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five (5) business days of the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 6.3_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. Parent and the Company shall share equally the fees incurred by
Parent and the Company in connection with the aforementioned filings under the
HSR Act.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other party in connection with any filing
or submission with or to a Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other parties
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each
will consult the other in advance on, all information relating to the other
party, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.3_ , each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture transaction or agree to any change of or restriction on its
business, and nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall (i) limit any applicable
rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_
so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this _Section 6.3_ or (ii) require Parent to offer,
accept or agree to (A) dispose of or hold separate any part of its or the
Companys business, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of
Parents and the Companys respective businesses, operations, assets or
product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business,
and/or (C) restrict or

 



      
 

 



 

change the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company or any of their
Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Sellers. Thereafter, neither the
Company, Sellers nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or
made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Sale, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or in the case of Parent by its
listing agreement with any securities exchange as determined in its good faith
judgment (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
insofar as practicable with the Sellers).

 



 

Section 6.5. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company agrees that, prior
to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_ , Parent and its Representatives shall, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable request by Parent at least twenty-four (24) hours in
advance, be entitled to make such investigation of the properties, assets,
businesses and operations of the Company and such examination of the books,
records and financial condition of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall obligate Sellers or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to take any actions that would (a) unreasonably
interrupt the normal course of the business, or (b) result in any waiver of
attorney-client privilege or violate any Laws or the terms of any Contract to
which any Seller or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party or to which any of their respective assets are subject, _provided
further_ , that prior to the expiration of any waiting period under Antitrust
Laws applicable to the Transactions, Parent and its Representatives shall only
be permitted such reasonable access which would comply with the requirements
of the Antitrust Laws. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in order to
mitigate, or put in place reasonable procedures to lessen, the impact of
complying with the foregoing restrictions. No investigation by Parent prior to
or after the date of this Agreement shall diminish or obviate any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the
Sellers contained in this Agreement, the Company Documents or any Ancillary
Agreement. In order that Parent may have the opportunity to make such
physical, business, accounting and legal review, examination or investigation
as it may reasonably request regarding the affairs of the Company, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to
cooperate with Parents Representatives in connection with such review and
examination; _provided_ , that the Company and Sellers shall have the right to
have a Representative present at all times during any such inspection, review
and examination. Parent and its Representatives shall hold information
received from the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ in confidence in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of
any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. From and
after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Parent shall not have
access to or communicate with any employees or any customers, suppliers or
other counterparties of the Company without the prior written

 



      
 

 



 

consent of Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and then only on such terms to which Sellers consent.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and the Sellers
shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
written notice to the Sellers, of (i) any written notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person (other than Persons
responding to notices delivered in accordance with _Section 6.8_ ) alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against or otherwise
involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates which relate to
the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained
in this Agreement (A) that is qualified as to materiality to be untrue or (B)
that is not so qualified to be untrue in any material respect or, in the case
of the Company, would cause any of the information provided in the Company
Disclosure Schedules to not be true and correct as of the time such
information was provided in light of such discovery or occurrence or non-
occurrence, and (iv) any material failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.6_ shall not (x) cure any breach of any representation or
warranty of the party giving such notice or any non-compliance by the party
giving such notice with any covenant, agreement or other provision contained
in this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice in respect of such breach or non-compliance. The Company shall
have the right to update _Section 10.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules
in respect of the Specified Employee Bonus and Specified Employees not less
than five (5) business days before the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.7. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as may otherwise be provided herein
(including Transaction Expenses taken into account in the calculation of the
Purchase Price), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Sale and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Sale is consummated.

 



 

Section 6.8. _Change In Control Customer Contracts_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, (i) notify each third party
to the Contracts listed on _Section 4.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules of the Transactions and (ii) request a waiver, if required, of any
termination rights arising as a result of the Transactions from each such
party.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consents and waivers
contemplated by _Section 6.8(a)_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.9. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall, at their own expense, prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed all Pass-Through Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Sellers
shall deliver to Parent copies of any such Pass-Through Tax Return at least
thirty (30 days) prior to the due date for filing such Pass-Through Tax
Return, and shall permit Parent to review and comment on such Tax Return prior
to filing and Sellers shall consider Parents comments in good faith. The
Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the Company
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than Pass-Through Tax Returns described
above). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice; _provided_ that there is a reasonable basis for the positions
claimed on such Tax Returns. The Company shall deliver to Parent, in the case
of any such Tax Return required to be filed on or prior to the Closing, or to
the Sellers, in the case of any such Tax Return required to be filed after the
Closing Date, copies of each such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Return, and shall permit Parent or the
Sellers, as applicable, to review and approve such Tax Return prior to filing
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
To the extent that any such Tax Return is required to be filed on or prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall timely file such Tax Return. If any such
Tax Return is required to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date,
Parent shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) such Tax Return. If the
parties have not resolved any dispute relating to any such Tax Return prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return, then the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall file such Tax Return as prepared, but such filing shall not
prejudice the rights of any party to pursue such dispute. The Company shall
timely pay (or cause to be paid) to the applicable Taxing Authority all Taxes
shown to be due on any Tax Return described in this _Section 6.9(a)_ ;
_provided_ that, with respect to any such Tax Return required to be filed
after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall pay to Parent the amount of Taxes
for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ not
later than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained), notwithstanding any
dispute with respect to such Tax Return.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, the Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared)
and file (or cause to be filed) when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company after the Closing Date in respect of any Straddle Period. A copy
of any such Tax Return shall be delivered to the Sellers at least twenty (20)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, and shall permit the
Sellers to review and approve such Tax Return prior to filing (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the parties
have not resolved any dispute relating to any such Tax Return prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return, then the Company shall file such Tax Return
as prepared, but such filing shall not prejudice the rights of any party to
pursue such dispute. The Sellers shall remit to Parent the portion of any
Taxes with respect to any such Tax Returns for which the Sellers are
responsible pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ (taking into account _Section
6.9(c)_ ) not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns (taking into account all extensions properly obtained)
notwithstanding any dispute with respect to any such Tax Return.

 



 

(c) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to Straddle
Periods, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
elect with the relevant Taxing

 



      
 

 



 

Authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period of the Company (a " **Short Period** "). In any case where
applicable Law does not permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the
last day of a Short Period, then for purposes of this Agreement, the portion
of each Tax that is attributable to the operations of the Company for the
period which would have qualified as a Short Period if such election had been
permitted by applicable Law (an " **Interim Period** ") shall be (i) in the
case of any property Tax, ad valorem Tax, or exemption, allowance or deduction
that is calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization deductions), the total amount of such Tax or
item for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Interim Period, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of any Tax or item not described in clause (i), the Tax that would be due
with respect to the Interim Period if such Interim Period were a Short Period
determined based upon an interim closing of the books.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Sellers shall have the sole right to control, through counsel of its own
choosing, the defense or settlement of any claim or proceeding relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, _provided_ , that the Sellers (i) shall
keep Parent apprised of all developments relating to such claim or proceeding,
(ii) shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence from any taxing
authority relating to any such claim or proceeding, (iii) shall provide Parent
in advance with any proposed submission relating to such claim or proceeding,
(iv) shall consult with Parent in good faith concerning any such submission
and the conduct of the proceeding, and (v) shall not finally settle any such
claim or proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event of
any conflict between the terms of this _Section 6.9(d)_ and _Section 9.5_ ,
the terms of this _Section 6.9(d)_ shall govern.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall have the sole right to control, through counsel of its own
choosing, the defense or settlement of any claim or proceeding relating to a
Straddle Period of the Company, provided, that Parent (i) shall keep the
Sellers apprised of all developments relating to such claim or proceeding,
(ii) shall provide the Sellers with copies of all correspondence from any
taxing authority relating to any such claim or proceeding, (iii) shall provide
the Sellers in advance with any proposed submission relating to such claim or
proceeding, (iv) shall consult with the Sellers in good faith concerning any
such submission and the conduct of the proceeding, and (v) shall not finally
settle any such claim or proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this _Section
6.9(e)_ and _Section 9.5_ , the terms of this _Section 6.9(e)_ shall govern.

 



 

(f) Each party hereto agrees to reasonably co-operate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns, any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
of or with respect to the Company. The parties further agree, upon request, to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) All sales, use, gross receipts, transfer, intangible, recordation,
documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges of any nature whatsoever
(including any penalties and interest) (collectively, " **Transfer Taxes** "),
applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, if any, shall be borne one-half by Sellers and one-half by Parent.
The party customarily responsible under applicable law shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and the parties will reasonably cooperate in duly and properly
completing any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The party
responsible for filing any such Tax Returns shall provide to the other party
evidence of timely filing and payment of all such Transfer Taxes. Within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of such evidence, the receiving party shall
pay to the filing party its one-half share of such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(h) Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers all refunds
or overpayments of Taxes and interest thereon received by such Parent or its
Affiliates attributable to Taxes paid by Sellers or the Company relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the Sellers allocable share of any such
amounts relating to any Straddle Period, net of any Taxes or expenses incurred
in connection with the receipt or realization thereof, to the extent the
respective amounts were received in cash or reduced Taxes otherwise payable by
Parent or the Company, provided that Parent shall not be obliged to reimburse
the Sellers if and to the extent the respective amounts that are (i) accrued
and reflected on the Final Closing Statement and taken into account in the
determination of Purchase Price or (iii) are attributable to a carryback of a
loss or other tax attribute from a taxable period (or the portion of a
Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Related Party Transactions_. As of the Closing Date, all
transactions, agreements, relationships and payments set forth on _Section
4.21_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be terminated without any
further obligation of the Company.

 



 

Section 6.11. _Assignment of Excluded Assets_. No later than immediately prior
to the Closing, the Company shall, and Sellers shall cause the Company to,
convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the applicable Seller or Sellers
designees, either (at Sellers direction) (i) without the payment of
consideration as a distribution with respect to Sellers interest in the
Interests or (ii) for the payment of nominal consideration, and such Seller or
Sellers designee shall acquire and take assignment and delivery from the
Company of, all rights, title and interest of the Company in and to the
Excluded Assets, free and clear of all Liens created by Parent or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, following the pre-Closing transaction provided for in the previous
sentence, the Companys remaining assets will not include the Excluded Assets,
and any reference in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in this Agreement to the assets of the Company will not include the Excluded
Assets.

 



 

Section 6.12. _Employees and Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For at least the period commencing on the Closing Date through the last
day of the year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to provide compensation and employee benefits (including employee
welfare and retirement benefits) to each individual who is employed by the
Company immediately prior to the Closing (the

 



       
 

 



 

" **Company Employees** ") that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable in all material respects to those provided by the Company to such
continuing employees immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
that nothing in this _Section 6.12(a)_ shall require the Company to, or
require Parent to cause the Company to, continue to employ any Company
Employee for any specified period of time after the Closing.

 



 

(b) It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that all provisions
contained in this _Section 6.12_ are included for the sole benefit of the
respective parties hereto and do not and shall not create any right in any
other person, including any Company Employee, any participant in any benefit
or compensation plan or any beneficiary thereof. Nothing in this _Section
6.12_ constitutes a contract of employment or guarantees any person continued
employment or particular compensation or employee benefits after the Closing.
In addition, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of
any benefit plan, policy or program, or (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.12_.

 



 

Section 6.13. _Director/Manager and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.
For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit the Company to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in any
Company Organizational Document providing for the exculpation or
indemnification with respect to acts or conduct prior to the Closing of former
officers and directors/managers (or equivalent governance position holders)
unless (a) required by applicable Law or (b) in connection with a
restructuring in which the governing documents of the successor to the Company
includes exculpation or indemnification provisions ( _provided_ , that such
provisions shall be equivalent or more favorable to such Persons in all
respects) with respect to such acts or conduct for the benefit of such
Persons, it being the intent of the parties that the officers and
directors/managers (and equivalent governance position holders) of the Company
prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled for such 6-year period to
exculpation and indemnification under such provisions with respect to acts or
conduct prior to the Closing to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law.

 



 

Section 6.14. _Pre-Closing Part D Disclosure_. For all customers for which
the Company has administered any Medicare Part D business in calendar years
2011 or 2012, the Company will send a disclosure (the " **Part D
Disclosure**") to each such customer within ten (10) days following the date
hereof, which shall include for each plan year the applicable information
related to Direct and Indirect Remuneration (DIR) reporting requirements as
set forth in 42 C.F.R. § 423.301 et seq, as further clarified in the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services memorandum dated June 7, 2013 entitled "Final
Medicare Part D DIR Reporting Requirements for 2012," (the " **DIR Reporting
Requirements** "). Specifically, the Company shall disclose to each such Part
D customer, in form and substance as laid out in the DIR Reporting
Requirements and with respect to Medicare Part D, (i) the amount of rebates
retained by the Company (DIR #1 in the DIR Reporting Requirements), (ii) the
amount of rebates paid to the customer (DIR #3 in the DIR Reporting
Requirements), (iii) the amount of administrative fees paid to the Company
(DIR #4 in the DIR Reporting Requirements), (iv) the detailed DIR amounts in
the aggregate for each 11-digit NDC (rebate dollars and all other DIR), (v)
the amounts, if any, applicable to any other "Column Name" in the DIR
Reporting Requirements, whether or not considered DIR (e.g., Rebate Admission
Fees Reported as Bona Fide Service Fees), and (vi) if the Company has deducted
from earned rebates the amount of service fees owed by the customer to the
Company for clinical and similar programs, the amount of the earned rebates
and the amount of the service

 



      
 

 



 

fee(s). The cover letter to each Part D Disclosure shall explain the purpose
of the disclosure and shall state the following (or words of substantially
similar import acceptable to Parent): "The Company negotiates and contracts
with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain rebates attributable to the
utilization of certain brand drugs. Rebate amounts may vary based upon the
amount of utilization, formulary position, and benefit design (sometimes
referred to as formulary or access rebates), and in some instances based on
market share across the Companys book of business generally and not in
respect of any individual plan customer (sometimes referred to as market share
or performance rebates). In addition, the Company provides administrative
services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, including providing data to such
manufacturers to verify the amount of the rebate to be paid and otherwise
administering the rebate program. The administrative fees do not exceed 3% of
the wholesale acquisition cost for the products at issue. Finally, the Company
provides additional services to pharmaceutical manufacturers unrelated to the
administration of rebates, for which the Company earns compensation also based
on the fair market value of such services." The cover letter to the Part D
Disclosure shall also indicate that the information is also being provided to
satisfy the requirements of Section 6005 of the Affordable Care Act (Pharmacy
Benefit Managers Transparency Requirements). For all customers for which the
Company has administered any Medicare Part D business in calendar year 2013,
the Company shall (or, if after Closing, Parent may cause the Company to) send
the disclosure required by this _Section 6.14_ as soon as reasonably possible
once the Company obtains the final, reconciled information necessary to enable
it to complete the DIR Report Requirements for 2013.

 



 

Section 6.15. _Post-Closing Commercial Business Disclosure_. For all customers
for which the Company administered any commercial business in calendar year
2013, the Sellers acknowledge and agree that Parent may cause the Company to
send a disclosure (the " **Commercial Business Disclosure** ") to each such
customer as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event later than 30 days following the Closing Date, which shall include (i)
the annual disclosure it has provided to each such customer relating solely to
its commercial (non-Medicare, non-Managed Medicaid) business, and indicating
that the figures relate solely to such commercial business and (ii) if the
Company has deducted from earned rebates the amount of service fees owed by
the customer to the Company for clinical and similar programs, the amount of
the earned rebates and the amount of the service fee(s). Such cover letter to
each Commercial Business Disclosure shall be in a substantially similar form
as those provided to plans in February 2014 and shall in addition state the
following (or words of substantially similar import acceptable to Parent):
"The Company negotiates and contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers to
obtain rebates attributable to the utilization of certain brand drugs. Rebate
amounts may vary based upon the amount of utilization, formulary position, and
benefit design (sometimes referred to as formulary or access rebates), and in
some instances based on market share across the Companys book of business
generally and not in respect of any individual plan customer (sometimes
referred to as market share or performance rebates). The amount that a
manufacturer pays to the Company relating to a particular brand drug (whether
in formulary/access rebates or market share/performance rebates, or both) may
differ from and exceed the amount that the Company has paid to your plan in
Rebate payments. The Company may retain a portion of such rebates as
compensation for its services to your plan. In addition, the Company provides
administrative services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, including providing
data to such manufacturers to verify the amount of the rebate to be paid and
otherwise administering the rebate program. In general, the Company retains
such

 



      
 

 



 

administrative fees, which typically do not exceed 3% of the wholesale
acquisition cost for the products at issue, for its services. Finally, the
Company provides additional services to pharmaceutical manufacturers unrelated
to the administration of rebates, for which the Company earns compensation
also based on the fair market value of such services."

 



 

Section 6.16. _Managed Medicaid Business Disclosure_. For all customers for

of the Company or any Seller set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true
and correct) or if the Company or any Seller has breached or failed to perform
or adhere to any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement,

Company set forth in _Section 4.11_ (Taxes) and _Section 4.19_ (Health Care
Regulatory Compliance) shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The

writing received by the other party prior to the expiration of the applicable

accordance with their terms.

resulting from:

 



 

(i) the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the

4.8_);

 



 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company or any Seller set

business of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including Taxes
attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;

respective officers, directors, managers and employees to the extent arising
out of or resulting from:

set forth in _Article V_ as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date, or
if expressly made as of an earlier date, as of such date; and

 



 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.3. _Escrow; Threshold; Limitations on Indemnity_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) The maximum Liability of the Sellers under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except in
respect of the Fundamental Representations) shall be an amount equal to the
Escrow Amount. The sole and exclusive source of recovery of the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except in respect of the
Fundamental Representations) shall be the Escrow Fund, and no Parent
Indemnified Party shall have any recourse against Seller, any of Sellers
Affiliates or any other Person in respect of any Losses or claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except in respect of the
Fundamental Representations).

 



 

(ii) The amount in the Escrow Fund shall be released to the Sellers, as
follows on the date that is five (5) business days following the fifteen (15)
month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " **Release Date** "): the
difference, if positive, obtained by subtracting from the remaining funds in
the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the aggregate amount of unsatisfied claims
for Losses of Parent Indemnified Parties under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_  _(iii)_
properly made on or prior to the Release Date in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article IX_ and the Escrow Agreement. Further, from and
after the Release Date, to the extent that (A) any amounts have been withheld
in respect of such unsatisfied claims and (B) the applicable underlying claims
are resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Parties, such amounts shall be
promptly released to the Sellers in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(iii) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ unless all such Losses of the Parent
Indemnified Parties thereunder shall aggregate to more than $500,000 (the "
**Losses Threshold** "), after which time the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to be indemnified against the Losses in excess of such amount;
_provided_ , that the Losses Threshold shall not apply to any Losses arising
out of or resulting from the breach of or inaccuracy in any Fundamental
Representation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Losses Threshold shall not
apply to any claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_  _(iii)_.

 



 

(iv) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ unless such Loss (including any series of
related Losses) equals or exceeds $25,000 (the " **De Minimis Threshold** ")
(it being

 



       
 

 



 

understood that claims below the De Minimis Threshold shall not be aggregated
for purposes of the immediately preceding subsection (iii)); _provided_ , that
the De Minimis Threshold shall not apply to any Losses arising out of or
resulting from the breach of or inaccuracy in any Fundamental Representation.
For avoidance of doubt, the De Minimis Threshold shall not apply to any claims
for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_  _(iii)_.

 



 

(v) In no event shall the Sellers be liable hereunder for any amounts in
excess of the amount of the Purchase Price actually received by the Sellers.

 



 

(b) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers, the Seller Indemnified Parties, Parent and
the Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether under this Agreement or arising
under common law or any other applicable Law) shall be as provided in this
_Article IX_; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall
operate to interfere with or impede the operation of (i) the provisions of
_Section 2.3_, _Section 2.5_, _Section 2.6_ or _Section 2.7_; (ii) the
rights of any party hereto to seek the remedy of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies where available
hereunder; (iii) the rights of any such Person under any Ancillary Agreement;
or (iv) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud.

 



 

(c) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided for under
this _Article IX_ shall be calculated net of any Tax benefit actually
realized in cash or a reduction of cash Tax paid by the Indemnified Party (or
its Affiliates) from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses in the Tax
year in which the Loss was incurred.

 



 

(d) No claim for indemnification may be made by a Parent Indemnified Party and
no indemnification shall be required to the extent that the Losses sustained
or incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party for which indemnification is
sought were accrued and reflected on the Final Closing Statement and taken
into account in the determination of Purchase Price.

 



 

(e) No Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification under this
_Article IX_ from and against any items excluded from the definition of Loss,
unless such items are awarded to a third party against an Indemnified Party as
part of a Third Party Claim.

 



 

Section 9.4. _Contribution_. The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided for under this _Article IX_ shall be calculated
net of (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered under Policies with
respect to which premiums were fully paid as of the Closing Date or other
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from third parties with
respect to such Losses, but including any deductibles, self-insurance or
retention amounts and co-payments under the applicable insurance policies; and
(ii) any amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party as a result of any
indemnification, contribution or other payment of a third party. In any case
where an Indemnified Party actually recovers, under any Policies described in
the preceding sentence or from other sources of recovery, any amount in
respect of any Losses for which such Indemnified Party was indemnified
pursuant to this _Article IX_, such Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to the
applicable Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the amount of the expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
procuring

 



      
 

 



 

such recovery). In any case where an Indemnified Party reasonably determines
it may recover by using commercially reasonable efforts all or a part of such
Losses under such Policies or from other sources of recovery based on the
underlying claim or demand asserted against the applicable Indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
proceed under such policies or against such sources as are necessary to permit
recovery of such amounts; _provided_ , that "commercially reasonable efforts"
for purposes of this _Section 9.4_ shall not include the commencement or
threat of litigation or the expenditure of material amounts of money.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
seek to recover the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
for under this _Article IX_ against the Escrow Fund or, if applicable, the
Sellers without first being required to use any efforts or seek any
alternative recoveries pursuant to this _Section 9.4_.

 



 

Section 9.5. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification Notices_. In order to obtain indemnity in respect of a
Loss as provided by _Section 9.2_, the applicable Parent Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be (the " **Indemnified Party** ")
shall deliver a written notice signed by a Seller (in the case of a Seller
Indemnified Party) or an officer of Parent (in the case of a Parent
Indemnified Party) and delivered to the party from whom indemnity is sought
(the " **Indemnifying Party** ") and (i) stating that the Indemnified Party
has paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it
will be obligated to pay, incur, sustain or accrue, a Loss against which it is
entitled to indemnification hereunder; (ii) specifying in reasonable detail
the nature of such Loss (including the calculation thereof or the basis for
estimation thereof), the date insofar as practicable such Loss was paid or is
expected to be incurred, sustained or accrued or the basis on which it
anticipates incurring, sustaining or accruing such Loss, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, Tax matter or other matter
resulting in such Loss or out of which such Loss arose or to which such Loss
relates; and (iii) specifying the amount of cash to be delivered to the
Indemnified Party (for the benefit of the pertinent Parent Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be) as indemnity against each
such Loss (such notice, an " **Indemnification Notice** "). The
Indemnification Notice shall be delivered to the Indemnifying Party promptly,
and in any event within thirty (30) days of the time that such Indemnified
Party learns of the event or circumstance that may give rise to a claim
hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party (as
such) is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. If a Loss is
anticipated but not yet incurred, sustained or accrued at the time an
Indemnification Notice is given, an additional Indemnification Notice shall be
given providing such information regarding the Loss incurred, sustained or
accrued as was not included in an earlier Indemnification Notice. In the case
where an Indemnified Party other than a party hereto shall seek to obtain the
indemnity provided by _Section 9.2_, the applicable party hereto shall give
an appropriate Indemnification Notice on behalf of such Indemnified Party,
_provided_ , that such Indemnified Party has provided to the applicable party
hereto such information as such party may reasonably request for such purpose.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice (a
" **Third Party Claim Notice** ", which may be part of an Indemnification
Notice) of any claim, assertion or action by or in respect of a third party,
including any civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory, investigative or
arbitral proceeding (a " **Third Party Claim** "), as to which an Indemnified
Party may claim indemnification hereunder or as to which the Losses Threshold
may be applied, together with copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) served on or received by such Indemnified Party, as soon as is
practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) days of the time that such
Indemnified Party learns of such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the rights of
the Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party (as such) is actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and, with
respect to Third Party Claims which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in
writing its obligation to provide indemnification for hereunder (subject to
the limitations on indemnification set forth herein), to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses, and to employ
counsel of its choosing in connection therewith, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided, however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim (unless otherwise consented to in writing by Parent) if (A)
the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with an action, suit,
proceeding or claim that is criminal in nature or being brought by a
Governmental Authority, (B) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction
restricting the conduct of the Indemnified Partys business, (C) the Third
Party Claim has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in Losses that would
exceed the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund, or (D) the Third Party Claim
involves as a claimant a customer, client or supplier of the Indemnified Party
or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of a
Third Party Claim Notice (or such shorter period of time as may be
necessitated by the nature of such Third Party Claim and specified in the
Third Party Claim Notice) to notify the Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying
Party will assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party has the right to and elects to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim (or the Indemnified Party has consented to the Indemnifying Partys
assumption of such defense), (A) the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its own expense;
_provided, however_ , that the fees and expenses of separate counsel retained
by the Indemnified Party shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund (in the case of
a Parent Indemnified Party) or by Parent (in the case of a Seller Indemnified
Party) if (x) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, on the
advice of outside legal counsel, that a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, or (y) the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the
Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue such Third Party Claim and
the Indemnified Party has delivered notice of such failure to the Indemnifying
Party; and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall (w) conduct the defense of such
Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed of material developments in the Third Party Claim at all
stages thereof, (x) reasonably promptly submit to the Indemnified Party copies
of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions

 



      
 

 



 

and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection
therewith, (y) permit the Indemnified Party and its counsel to confer on the
conduct of the defense thereof, and (z) permit the Indemnified Party and its
counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to
their submission.

 



 

(iii) Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party
Claim by the Sellers shall require the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any
compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party Claim by
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall require the prior written consent of the
Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless (x) such compromise, settlement or offer solely involves the
payment of money or (y) involves as a claimant a customer, client or supplier
of Parent, the Company or any their Affiliates.

 



 

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice of its assumption
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim with the expenses of such defense to be
paid out of the Escrow Fund (in the case of a Parent Indemnified Party) or by
Parent (in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party), _provided, however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party may participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim (with the same rights as are set forth in clause (ii)(B) above) with its
own counsel at its own expense.

 



 

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

 



 

(i) If the Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to any claim or claims
for indemnification made in any Indemnification Notice within thirty (30) days
after delivery of such Indemnification Notice, then the Sellers and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Sellers and Parent should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both parties.

 



 

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within
sixty (60) days after delivery of an Indemnification Notice, either Parent or
the Sellers may demand arbitration of the matter in accordance with the
following provisions of this _Section 9.5_ unless the amount of the Loss is
at issue in pending litigation or arbitration with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration. If such dispute is subject to arbitration,
it shall be settled by arbitration conducted in accordance with the rules and
procedures then in effect of the American Arbitration Association by one
arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Sellers. In the event that,
within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent
and the Sellers cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Sellers
shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select
a third arbitrator. If one party but not the other fails to select an
arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that
the arbitration will be conducted by the one arbitrator selected by the party
which has made such a selection.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The arbitrator
shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid,
including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator
and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association. The
arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period
and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery
while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of
the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and
shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and
costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the
arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim for indemnification made in
an Indemnification Notice shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Judgment
upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction.

 



 

(iv) The foregoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute between
the Sellers and a Parent Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_.

 



 

Section 9.6. _Mitigation_. Upon an Indemnified Party becoming aware of an
event that reasonably would be expected to give rise to a Loss, such
Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
such potential Loss in accordance with the requirements of applicable Laws.

 



 

Section 9.7. _No Duplication of Losses_. An Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to recover any amount due hereunder more than once in respect of the
same Loss, including by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Losses constituting an inaccuracy in or breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation.

 



 

Section 9.8. _Limitation on Set-off_. Each of Parent, on behalf of itself and
each other Parent Indemnified Party, and each Seller, on behalf of itself and
each other Seller Indemnified Party, agrees that Parent shall have a right to
set off any finally determined indemnification claims pursuant to this
_Article IX_ against any payment due hereunder (including pursuant to
_Article I_ or _Article II_) or under the Subscription Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Fund must first be exhausted by the
Parent Indemnified Parties in order for Parent to have any right of set off
against any payment due hereunder (including pursuant to _Article I_ or
_Article II_), under the Subscription Agreements or under any other agreement
which such party has entered into in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

Section 9.9. _No Liability of Representatives_. None of the Representatives
(each solely in their capacity as such) of any Seller, of the Company or of
Parent shall have any

 



      
 

 



 

personal liability or obligation to any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or
Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in connection with this Agreement
or any other document executed in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or in respect of any statement,
representation, warranty or assurance of any kind made by any Seller, the
Company or Parent.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment
made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes
unless a contrary treatment is required under applicable Law.

 



 

ARTICLE X _ 
Miscellaneous_

 



 

Section 10.1. _Sellers_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints George N. Petrovas as the
designated representative of such Seller (the " **Seller Representative** ").
The Seller Representative shall, for each Seller, have the right, power and
authority to take all actions required or permitted under the Escrow Agreement
and this Agreement with respect to the interests and rights of the Sellers
including, the exercise of the power to (i) authorize the delivery of cash
from the Escrow Account to Parent or to a Parent Indemnified Party in
satisfaction of claims by a Parent Indemnified Party, (ii) agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders

actions necessary in the judgment of George Petrovas for the accomplishment of

waivers, ancillary agreements, notices, extensions, certificates and other
documents relating to the Transactions, and (v) interpret the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and all documents to be executed and delivered in
connection herewith on behalf of the Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt,
delivery of any notice, certificate or other writing to the Seller
Representative under this Agreement or in connection with the Transactions
shall be deemed delivered to the Sellers collectively. If the Seller
Representative shall resign or become deceased or otherwise be unable to
fulfill his responsibilities as representative of the Sellers, the Sellers
shall, within ten (10) business days after the occurrence of such event,
appoint (by vote of Sellers holding a majority of the Interests immediately
prior to the Closing) a successor representative and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor
shall become the "Seller Representative" upon such appointment.

 



 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller Representative shall
constitute a decision for all of the Sellers, and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Seller, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely
exclusively upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
Seller. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any Liability
hereunder to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of Seller Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.2. _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Closing,

respective Boards of Directors or equivalent body, if applicable.

 



 

Section 10.3. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Closing, any party may, subject to _Section 10.2_ and applicable Laws, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by the
other party with any of the agreements contained herein, or (d) waive any of
such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by
the Company, the Sellers or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 10.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of applicable Laws or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that (a) Parent may assign
or delegate any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to
one or more Affiliates of Parent, _provided_ , that (i) Parent causes any such
assignee to assume all of Parents Liabilities associated with such assigned
rights and interest and (ii) Parent remains fully liable to the Sellers for
the assignees fulfillment of all such Liabilities hereunder, and (b) any
party hereto may assign its right to receive a payment entitled to be received
by it pursuant to this Agreement. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section shall be null and void.

 



 

Section 10.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties (including by facsimile or via
portable document format (.pdf)).

 



 

Section 10.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(which term shall be deemed to include the exhibits and schedules hereto and
the other certificates, documents and instruments delivered hereunder), the
Company Disclosure Schedules and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) shall be binding
upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and, nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.7. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to the principles, policies or provisions thereof or of any other
jurisdiction concerning conflict or choice of laws.

Agreement or the Transactions, and agrees to take any and all action necessary
or appropriate to effect such waiver.

 



 

Section 10.8. _Specific Enforcement; Limitation on Monetary Remedies_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers and Parent agree that irreparable damage would occur and that
the parties would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Sellers and Parent shall be entitled to seek equitable relief (including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement) in any Delaware state
court or any federal court of competent jurisdiction located in Delaware
without proof of actual damages or otherwise, and without any bond or other
security being required of it therefor, this being cumulative and not
exclusive and in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than in
the case of fraud of the Sellers or of the Company prior to the Closing, in no
event shall Parent or its Affiliates be entitled to recover monetary damages
in excess of, and in no event shall Sellers or (prior to the Closing, the
Company) be liable for, Liabilities in excess of the amount of the Purchase
Price actually received by the Sellers in connection with this Agreement, the
Subscription Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

each of the parties hereto (i) expressly and irrevocably consents to submit

any dispute pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (ii)
agrees that services of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. mail
addressed to him at the address set forth in _Section 10.10_ shall constitute

any such action or proceeding, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this

thereof), (v) agrees that the Court of Chancery and federal court located in
the State of Delaware shall be deemed to be a convenient forum, and (vi)
agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise), in any
such action or proceeding, any claim by any party hereto that is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that such

 



      
 

 



 

action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter
of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court.

Section 10.14. _Interpretation_.

 



 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement and the headings to
Exhibits and Schedules attached to this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "ordinary
course of business" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "and
consistent with past practice". All terms defined in this Agreement shall have
the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Except if otherwise explicitly provided, any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a

 



      
 

 



 

Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The use of "or" is
not intended to be exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.15. _Release_. As of the Closing, (a) Parent on its own behalf and
on behalf of the Company (together with Parent, a " **Parent Releasing
Person** ") hereby releases and forever discharges the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns (each, a " **Seller Released
Person** "), and (b) each Seller hereby releases and forever discharges Parent
and its respective Affiliates (including the Company), successors and assigns
(each, a " **Parent Released Person** "), in each case, from all debts,
demands, causes of action, suits, covenants, torts, damages and any and all
claims, defenses, offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities whatsoever, of
every name and nature, both at Law and in equity, known or unknown, suspected
or unsuspected, accrued or unaccrued, which have been or could have been or
could be asserted against any Seller Released Person or Parent Released
Person, as applicable, which such Parent Releasing Person or such Seller, as
applicable, has or ever had or may have, which arise out of or in any way
relate to events, circumstances, actions or omissions occurring, existing or
taken prior to or as of the Closing in respect of matters relating to the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties acknowledge and agree that
this _Section 10.15_ does not apply to and shall not constitute a release of
any rights or Liabilities arising (i) under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement; (ii) under any Employment Agreement or other agreement entered into
by a Seller Released Person with Parent or any of its Affiliates on or prior
to the Closing Date in connection with the Transactions; or (iii) as a result
of fraud by a Seller Released Person or a Parent Released Person, as
applicable, in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

Section 10.16. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO PARTY HERETO NOR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION, WRITTEN OR ORAL, RELATING TO THE
COMPANY.

 



 

Section 10.17. _Representation of Sellers_. Parent agrees, on its own behalf
and on behalf of the Parent Indemnified Parties, that, following the Closing,
Mayer Brown LLP may serve as counsel to Sellers, the Seller representative
specified in _Section 10.1_, and their respective Affiliates, in connection
with any and all matters whether or not related to related to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, notwithstanding any representation by Mayer
Brown LLP of the Company prior to the Closing Date. Parent (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) and the Company hereby (a) waive any claim they
have or may have that Mayer Brown LLP has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agree that,
in the event that a

 



      
 

 



 

dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, any Affiliate of Parent or
the Company, and Sellers, the Seller representative or any of their
Affiliates, Mayer Brown LLP may represent Sellers, the Seller representative
or any of their Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent, its Affiliates or the Company,
and even though Mayer Brown LLP may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Parent (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) and the Company also further agree that, as to all communications
among Mayer Brown LLP and the Company, Sellers and the Seller representative,
or Sellers Affiliates and representatives, that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any litigation or disputes
among the parties to this Agreement existing prior to the Closing Date, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
Sellers and the Seller representative and may be controlled by Sellers and the
Seller representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, its
Affiliates or the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.17_
to the contrary, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent, the Company and a third party other than a party to this
Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Mayer Brown
LLP to such third party; _provided_ , that the Company may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller representative.
