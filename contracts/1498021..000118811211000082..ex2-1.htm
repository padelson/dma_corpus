the Working Capital Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the
agreement of the Purchaser and the Majority Shareholder, and the calculation

does not dispute any item contained therein, the Working Capital Schedule
delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a) shall be deemed to be the Final Working

from the Purchaser and its Affiliates and the Majority Shareholder and his
Affiliates): Deloitte, Ernst and Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Grant Thornton,
McGladrey and Pullen or BDO Seidman (the "Accounting Referee"). In resolving any

Schedule and the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any,
based thereon shall be made within thirty (30) days following its engagement,
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Majority
Shareholder and the Purchaser and shall be deemed a final, binding and
conclusive arbitration award. A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
may be entered upon the Accounting Referee's determination. All fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be shared pro rata between the
Majority Shareholder and the Purchaser in proportion to the allocation of the
dollar amount of the amounts remaining in dispute between the Majority
Shareholder and the Purchaser made by the Accounting Referee, such that,

shall pay to the Majority Shareholder an amount equal to the Working Capital
Surplus, and if there is a Working Capital Deficit, the Majority Shareholder

to the Working Capital Deficit. If a dispute exists between the Majority
Shareholder and the Purchaser regarding the amount of the Working Capital
Surplus or Working Capital Deficit reflected in the Working Capital Schedule
delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the appropriate Party shall pay or cause
to be paid to the other appropriate Party (in the case of the Majority
Shareholder to the Purchaser, from the Escrow Fund) the uncontested amount
prior to the determination of the disputed amount in accordance with Section
3.4.

  

  

(e) If any amount or matter taken into account in the determination of the
Final Working Capital Schedule could also be the basis for any claim of breach
by a Party of the representations and warranties of the other Party contained
in this Agreement, any Losses related to such breach shall be net of the
amount related thereto included in the determination of the Final Working
Capital Schedule.

  

  

(f) On or before November 15, 2011, the Majority Shareholder shall prepare and

determine estimated amounts for the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities to be included on the Working Capital Schedule. If the Majority
Shareholder and the Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on such estimated
amounts within thirty (30) days, the determination of such estimated amounts
shall be submitted to, and made by, the Accounting Referee.

  

  

Section 3.5 Escrow. At the Closing, the Parent shall deposit the Escrow

form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.5 (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow
Deposit, less any interest or other income earned on the Escrow Deposit which
shall be distributed to the Majority Shareholder on a monthly basis (the
"Escrow Fund"), shall remain in escrow following the Closing as security for
the obligations of the Majority Shareholder under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, for disbursement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

Parent Stock shall be deemed to have a value of $17.55, (based on the Parent's
average closing stock price for each trading day during the period from
November 2, 2010 through January 10, 2011, the last trading day prior to the
date of this Agreement).

  

  

Section 3.8 Bifurcated Wire Transfers to Effectuate Tax Withholding. The
Purchaser and the Shareholders agree that, with respect to those Minority
Shareholders who will report taxable compensation on the Closing Date under
their Restricted Stock Agreements, the cash proceeds payable to such Minority
Shareholders under Schedule 3.3(d) shall be made in two separate wire
transfers at the Closing: (a) the first wire transfer to be sent to the
Company in the amount of the applicable Tax withholdings (but not the
employer's portion of such Tax withholdings) payable with respect to such
compensation; and (b) the second wire transfer to be sent to such Minority
Shareholders for the remaining amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the other
Minority Shareholders and the Majority Shareholder shall not be subject to the
provisions of this Section 3.8.

Section 4.17 Company Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Schedule 4.17(a) contains a true, correct and complete list of each
Company Benefit Plan and ERISA Affiliate Plan.

  

  

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan and ERISA Affiliate Plan
identified on Schedule 4.17(a), the Company has heretofore made available to
the Purchaser, in each case where existing and in the Company's possession,
true, correct and complete copies of the plan documents and any amendments
thereto (or, in the event the plan is not written, a written description
thereof), any related trust, insurance contract or other funding vehicle, any
reports or summaries required under all applicable Laws, including ERISA or
the Code, and (with respect to each current Company Benefit Plan or ERISA
Affiliate Plan intended to qualify under Code Section 401) the following: (i)
the most recent determination or opinion letter received from the IRS, (ii)
nondiscrimination and coverage tests for the most recent three (3) full plan
years, (iii) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with
the IRS and financial statements (if applicable), and (iv) the three (3) most
recent actuarial reports or valuations (if applicable). As to any Company
Benefit Plan that is a Welfare Plan as defined in ERISA, the Company has also
made available the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the
IRS and financial statements (if applicable). Additionally, the Company has
made available or will make available such other documentation with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan (whether current or not) as
has been reasonably requested by the Purchaser. Since approximately 2002, the
Company and the Subsidiaries have not maintained an employee handbook.

  

  

(c) The records of the Company and each Subsidiary accurately reflect, in all
material respects, the employment or service histories of its employees,
independent contractors, contingent workers and leased employees, including
their hours of service.

  

  

(d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (i) there has not occurred any
non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA that would subject the Company, a Subsidiary
or the Purchaser to any material liability; and (ii) no fiduciary (within the
meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Company Benefit Plan that is subject
to Part 4 of Title I of ERISA has committed a breach of fiduciary duty that
would subject the Company or the Purchaser to any material liability. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any excise taxes under Chapter 43
of the Code and nothing has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company, a Subsidiary or the
Purchaser to any such taxes. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not trigger any Taxes under Section 4978 of the Code. No Company Benefit
Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no Company Benefit Plan or ERISA
Affiliate Plan is or was a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA), a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of
the Code), or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section
3(40)(A) of ERISA), nor has the Company, a Subsidiary or any of its or their
ERISA Affiliates ever sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or had any
liability or obligation with respect to, any such Company Benefit Plan or
ERISA Affiliate Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-32-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan has been established,
registered, qualified, invested, operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with all Applicable
Benefit Laws. The Company and each Subsidiary have performed and complied in
all material respects with all of their obligations under or with respect to
the Company Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
incurred, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact exists that reasonably
could be expected to result in, any liability to the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or any ERISA Affiliate Plan,
including any liability, tax, penalty or fee under any Applicable Benefit Law
(other than to pay premiums, contributions or benefits in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice). There are no current or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened Liens on any assets of any Company
Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan.

  

  

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or circumstance exists that could
adversely affect the tax-exempt status of a Company Benefit Plan or ERISA
Affiliate Plan that is intended to be tax-exempt. Further, each such plan
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
and the trusts maintained thereunder that are intended to be exempt from
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter with respect to all Applicable Benefits Laws
on which the IRS will issue a favorable determination letter on its
qualification.

  

  

(g) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (i)
complaint, claim, charge, suit, proceeding or other action of any kind with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan (other than a
routine claim for benefits in accordance with such Company Benefit Plan's or
ERISA Affiliate Plan's claims procedures and that have not resulted in any
litigation) or (ii) proceeding, examination, audit, inquiry, investigation,
citation, or other action of any kind in or before any Governmental Entity
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there exists no state of facts that after notice or
lapse of time or both reasonably could be expected to give rise to any such
claim, investigation, examination, audit or other proceeding or to affect the
registration of any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan required to
be registered. All benefit claims will be paid in accordance with Applicable
Benefit Laws and the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or ERISA
Affiliate Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-33-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) All contributions and premium payments (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) that are due with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been made within the time periods
prescribed by ERISA and the Code, and all contributions and premium payments
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are an obligation of
the Company and not yet due have either been made to such Company Benefit
Plan, or have been accrued on the Financial Statements. Adequate reserves will
be reflected on the Final Working Capital Schedule for any vacation, sick pay,
and other paid time off (i) accrued but unearned or (ii) earned but unused, in
each case as of the Closing Date by the employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(i) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.17(i), with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA), all claims incurred by the Company and the
Subsidiaries are (i) insured pursuant to a contract of insurance whereby the
insurance company bears any risk of loss with respect to such claims, (ii)
covered under a contract with a health maintenance organization, pursuant to
which the health maintenance organization bears the liability for claims or
(iii) reflected as a liability or accrued for on the Financial Statements.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.17(i), no Company Benefit Plan provides or
has ever provided benefits, including death, medical or health benefits
(whether or not insured), after an employee's termination of employment, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) with respect thereto other than (A) continuation coverage required
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, and the
regulations thereunder, and any other Applicable Benefit Laws, (B) death
benefits or retirement benefits under any employee pension benefit plan, (C)
deferred compensation benefits, reflected as liabilities on the Financial
Statements, or (D) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or
former employee (or the employee's beneficiary).

  

  

(j) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result (either
alone or in combination with any other event) in: (i) any payment of, or
increase in, remuneration or benefits, to any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary; or (ii) any cancellation of
indebtedness owed to the Company or any Subsidiary by any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary; (iii) the
acceleration of the vesting, funding or time of any payment or benefit to any
employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary; or
(iv) result in any "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be reasonable
compensation for services rendered).

that the ESOP was qualified under Code Section 401(a) and the ESOP was an
employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Code Section 4975(e)(7).
To the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such

plan or employee stock ownership plan. The Shares held by the Trustees on
behalf of the ESOP ("ESOP Shares") constitute "employer securities" within the
meaning of Code Section 409(l) and "qualifying employer securities" within the
meaning of Section 4975(e)(8) of the Code and 407(d)(5) of ERISA. The ESOP
Trust is the record owner of all of the assets of the ESOP Trust and the ESOP

Liens.

  

  

(b) The Trustees are fiduciaries of the ESOP as described in Section 3(21)(A)
of ERISA, are vested with the authority to act on behalf of the ESOP to the
extent specified in ERISA and the ESOP Trust. The Trustees have the full power
and authority to act on behalf of the ESOP regarding the transactions
contemplated by Section 7.19(b) of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by Section 7.19(b) of this Agreement will not (i)
violate any of the terms and conditions of, (ii) result in a material
modification of, or (iii) constitute (or with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute) a default under, the ESOP plan document, trust agreement or
any material instrument, contract or other agreement to which the ESOP is a
party or by or to which it or its assets or properties are bound or subject.
No other proceedings on the part of the ESOP, the Trust, or the Trustees are
necessary to authorize the transactions contemplated by Section 7.19(b) of
this Agreement. No government authorization or other consent (including the
consent of ESOP participants) is required in connection with the ESOP, the
ESOP Trust or the Trustees executing or carrying out the transactions

Section 6.5 SEC Documents. Parent has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required by the Parent to be filed with the SEC
since October 27, 2010 (the "SEC Documents"). As of its date, each SEC
Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules, policy
statements and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such SEC Documents, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein (other than in the case of
registration statements of Parent filed under the Securities Act, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except to the
extent that such SEC Documents have been modified or superseded by a later
filed SEC Document. The consolidated financial statements of Parent included
in Parent's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-168831), as
amended, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009
and the nine-months ended September 30, 2010, complied at the time they were
filed in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and each
fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Parent as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. Except for liabilities
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
in the ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent balance
sheet included in the SEC Documents, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of
Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent or the notes thereto which, individually
or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations, businesses, properties, assets or
liabilities of Parent. None of the Subsidiaries of Parent is subject to the
informational reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.6 Brokers, Finders and Investment Bankers. Except for the engagement
of William Blair and Company, L.L.C., neither Purchaser or Parent, nor any
officer, member, director or employee of Purchaser or Parent, nor any
Affiliate of Purchaser or Parent, has employed any broker, finder or
investment banker or incurred any liability for any investment banking fees,
financial advisory fees, brokerage fees or finders' fees in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 6.7 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. Purchaser and
Parent acknowledge and agree that the Company and the Shareholders do not
make, and have not made, any express or implied representations or warranties
relating to the Shares, the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Business
(including, without limitation, the properties, assets, liabilities thereof)
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby other
than those made by the Company and the Shareholders set forth in this
Agreement (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules) and the Shareholder

Agreement; provided, that for purposes of determining whether there is a
breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser or the Parent under
Article VI hereof and for purposes of determining the obligations of the

all of the Company Benefit Plans, and, at the Excluded Subsidiaries' sole cost
and expense (which the Majority Shareholder shall cause the Excluded
Subsidiaries to pay), shall allow all employees currently in each such Company
Benefit Plan that effective as of the Closing will be employed by the Excluded
Subsidiaries, to maintain coverage in such Company Benefit Plan through and
including the last day of the calendar month during which the Closing occurs,
but only to the extent permitted under the terms of such Company Benefit Plans

plan. Effective as of the first day of the calendar month immediately
following the calendar month during which the Closing occurs, all employees of
the Excluded Subsidiaries will be transferred to one or more Employee Benefit
Plans sponsored or maintained by one or more of the Excluded Subsidiaries or
an Affiliate thereof. The Company shall terminate its 401(k) plan no later

costs and expense in connection with the operating costs and the termination
of any other Company Benefit Plans incurred after the Closing, including, in
the event of any termination of tail reinsurance coverage, the amount of any
claims that exceed the Company's and the Subsidiaries' "spec" limit of $75,000
and the plans aggregate claim costs. From and after the Closing Date, except
as otherwise provided above with respect to employees that effective as of the
Closing Date will be employed by the Excluded Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
shall assume, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to pay as and
when due: (i) all amounts with respect to any and all claims incurred prior to
the Closing Date under the Company Benefit Plans with respect to any current
or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or their covered
dependents, including any and all tail liabilities for current claims in
process as of the Closing Date, but only to the extent such amounts are
reflected in the Final Working Capital Schedule; (ii) all amounts with respect
to any and all claims incurred on or after the Closing Date under the Company
Benefit Plans with respect to any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary as
of the Closing Date or their covered dependents; and (iii) COBRA continuation
coverage for any current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
as of the Closing Date or their covered dependents. For purposes of this
paragraph, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred as of the date the
participant receives the services or goods that gave rise to such claim,
regardless of when the claim was reported for purposes of receiving the
benefit to which the claim relates. To the extent the amounts under clause (i)
in this Section 7.8(a) are not reflected in the Final Working Capital
Schedule, the Majority Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries from any and all Losses relating
to such amounts in accordance with the terms, conditions, procedures and
limitations of Article XI of this Agreement.

health, life insurance, disability, accidental death and dismemberment
insurance or employee stock purchase plan maintained by the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates or any compensation or benefits to be provided after the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.

  

  

(c) Employees. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to offer continued employment on an at will basis to
substantially all of their respective employees, excepting only those
employees to be terminated by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and whose names are set forth on a schedule to be
delivered by the Purchaser to the Company not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the "Separated Persons"), which schedule shall also
specify the Separation Costs for each Separated Person and the termination
date for each Separated Person (the "Separated Persons Schedule"). With
respect to the Separated Persons Schedule, (i) Separation Costs shall be
determined on a basis consistent with the severance policies of the Company
and the Subsidiaries and any severance obligations contained in any Employment
Agreement with a Separated Person and (ii) no termination date shall in any
event be more than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date. On the
Closing Date, the Company shall transfer irrevocably and pay into the Escrow
Fund, as an additional deposit, the dollar amount representing 100% of the
aggregate Separation Costs listed on the Separated Persons Schedule, up to a
maximum amount of Eight Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars ($860,000) (the
"Separation Costs Deposit"), which shall be used solely to pay the Separation
Costs set forth on the Separated Persons Schedule after the Closing Date with
respect to each Separated Person who is actually terminated on or before the
45th day following the Closing Date. The Company and the Subsidiaries shall
(and from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to) administratively effect the termination of the Separated
Persons and the timely payment to the Separated Persons from the Separation
Costs Deposit of all Separation Costs, in each case as set forth on the
Separated Persons Schedule and in accordance with its human resource policies
and applicable Laws. All requests to the Escrow Agent for disbursement of any
portion of the Separation Costs Deposit shall be made at the time each
Separated Person is terminated, by written notice from the Purchaser to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Separated Persons Schedule
and the Escrow Agreement, with a copy of each such notice to be concurrently
provided to the Majority Shareholder. On the date that is sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, the Majority Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive back from the Escrow Agent any portion of the Separation Costs Deposit
remaining in the Escrow Fund that has not been utilized to pay the Separation
Costs set forth on the Separated Persons Schedule.

the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement is not
intended to create a contract between the Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies, on the one hand, and any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary,
on the other hand, and no employee of the Company or any Subsidiary may rely
on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of contract claim against the
Purchaser or the Acquired Companies, (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to require any Acquired Company to continue to employ any
particular employee of the Company or any Subsidiary for any period after the
Closing, (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any benefit plan or construed to limit the Purchaser's or any
Acquired Company's right to terminate the employment of any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary during any period after the Closing.

  

  

Section 7.9 Confidential Information; Non-Competition; Nonsolicitation.

  

  

(a) Confidential Information. During the period from the date hereof until the
Closing, the Parties shall be bound by the terms of that certain Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement among the Parties (the "NDA"). If the Closing
occurs, the NDA shall forthwith terminate and the Shareholders shall hold in
confidence at all times following the Closing all Confidential Information and
shall not disclose, publish or make use of Confidential Information at any
time following the Closing without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.
Each Shareholder and the Company further acknowledges that he, she or it is
aware that the United States securities Laws prohibit any Person who has
material non-public information about a public company from purchasing or
selling securities of such public company or from communicating such
information to any other Person under circumstances in which it is reasonably
foreseeable that such Person is likely to purchase or sell securities. In the
event that any Shareholder or the Company or any of their Affiliates or agents
discloses any such information regarding the Parent or the Purchaser, the
Shareholders and (prior to the Closing) the Company shall be liable to the
Parent and the Purchaser for any failure by such person to treat such
information in the same manner as the Company is obligated to treat
Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement and the NDA.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-55-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Non-Competition.

  

  

(i) Each Shareholder hereby acknowledges that (A) each of the Purchaser and
the Company conducts the Business and has current plans to further expand the
Business throughout the Territory and (B) to protect adequately the interest
of the Purchaser in the business and goodwill of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, it is essential that any non-competition covenant with respect
thereto cover all of the Business and the entire Territory.

  

  

(ii) Each Shareholder agrees that he or she and such Shareholder's Affiliates
shall not, during the Non-Compete Period, in any manner, either directly,
indirectly, individually, in partnership, jointly or in conjunction with any
Person, (A) engage in the Business within the Territory, (B) have an equity or
profit interest in, advise or render services (of an executive, marketing,
manufacturing, research and development, administrative, financial,
consulting, employment, independent contracting or other nature) or lend money
to any Person that engages in the Business within the Territory, or (C)
perform, teach or instruct any Person to perform services of a type the
Business arranges or facilitates, or which are otherwise related to the
Business, including, without limitation, independent medical examinations,
peer reviews and expert testimony. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall prevent any Shareholder or any Shareholder's Affiliates from (w)
being employed by or otherwise contracting with the Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates, (x) owning an interest in the Parent, (y) purchasing up to five
percent (5%) of the outstanding capital stock or other securities of any
publicly traded corporation, or (z) engaging in or owning an interest in
otherwise conducting any activities in connection with the VES Business.

  

  

(c) Nonsolicitation. Each Shareholder agrees that such Shareholder and such
Shareholder's Affiliates shall not, during the Non-Compete Period, in any
manner, directly, indirectly, individually, in partnership, jointly or in
conjunction with any Person, (i) (x) recruit or solicit or attempt to recruit
or solicit, on his behalf or on behalf of any other Person, any employee of
any Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof who was an employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date or who is a Named
Retained Employee, (y) encourage any Person (other than the Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates) to recruit or solicit any employee of any Acquired Company
or an Affiliate thereof who was an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
on or prior to the Closing Date or who is a Named Retained Employee, or (z)
otherwise encourage any employee of the Acquired Company or any Affiliate
thereof who was an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to
the Closing Date or who is a Named Retained Employee to discontinue his or her
employment by any Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof; (ii) solicit any
customer of any Acquired Company or Affiliate thereof who is or has been a
customer of the Company or a Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date (other
than the VA) for the purpose of providing, distributing or selling products or
services similar to those sold or provided by any Acquired Company; or (iii)
persuade or attempt to persuade any customer or supplier of any Acquired
Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate or modify such customer's or
supplier's relationship with any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall apply to any employee of
any Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof, who responds to a general
public advertisement or otherwise contacts the Shareholder or a Shareholder's
Affiliates on his or her own initiative, without any direct or indirect
recruitment by the Shareholder or any Shareholder's Affiliates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-56-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Referrals. Each Shareholder agrees that, during the Non-Compete Period, if
and when any Person (other than the VA) contacts a Shareholder or any
Shareholder's Affiliates with respect to any aspect of the Business,
including, without limitation, inquiries or requests from customers or
potential customers with respect to the Business (including the performance of
independent medical examinations, record reviews, expert testimony or other
services), whether by web contact, phone, email, facsimile, mail or otherwise,
such Shareholder shall use his commercially reasonable efforts to refer any
such Person to the Purchaser. Such Shareholder further agrees not to
criticize, denigrate, or otherwise disparage the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, or any of their products,
services, processes, policies, practices, standards of business conduct, or
current or former areas of business.

  

  

(e) Severability. In the event a judicial or arbitral determination is made
that any provision of this Section 7.9 constitutes an unreasonable or
otherwise unenforceable restriction against a Shareholder or a Shareholder's
Affiliates, the provisions of this Section 7.9 shall be rendered void only to
the extent that such judicial or arbitral determination finds such provisions
to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable with respect to the Shareholder
or such Shareholder's Affiliates. In this regard, any judicial authority
construing this Agreement shall be empowered to sever any portion of the
Territory, any prohibited business activity or any time period from the
coverage of this Section 7.9 and to apply the provisions of this Section 7.9
to the remaining portion of the Territory, the remaining business activities
and the remaining time period not so severed by such judicial or arbitral
authority. The time period during which the prohibitions set forth in this
Section 7.9 shall apply shall, as to any Shareholder, be tolled and suspended
for a period equal to the aggregate time during which such Shareholder or any
of such Shareholder's Affiliates violates such prohibitions in any respect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-57-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Injunctive Relief. Any remedy at law for any breach of the provisions
contained in this Section 7.9 shall be inadequate and the Purchaser shall be
entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy the Purchaser
might have hereunder.

  

  

(g) Limitation on Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except to the extent that that a breach by a Minority Shareholder of this
Section 7.9 would also constitute or result in, or could be deemed, a breach
by the Majority Shareholder of this Section 7.9, in no event shall the
Majority Shareholder be liable to the Purchaser or Parent or be required to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for a breach by a Minority
Shareholder of this Section 7.9 under Article XI.

  

  

Section 7.10 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date.

  

  

(i) The Majority Shareholder shall cause to be prepared, in draft form, the
Pre-Acquisition Consolidated Return, as well as all other income Tax Returns
for the Company and the Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Periods") the due date of which is
after the Closing Date. Collectively, all such income Tax Returns, including
the Pre-Acquisition Consolidated Return, are hereinafter referred to as the
"Pre-Acquisition Returns." For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Pre-
Acquisition Returns" shall not include any Tax Returns filed by any of the
Shareholders. All draft Pre-Acquisition Returns shall be prepared consistently
with Section 7.10(b) and also in a manner consistent with the past practice of
the Company, unless otherwise required by Law; provided, however, that none of
the draft Pre-Acquisition Returns shall reflect any position for which there
is not "substantial authority" (within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i)
of the Code). If, for any reason, the Company officer who has traditionally
prepared and executed the income Tax Returns filed by the Company and the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date is no longer responsible for handling
(or is unable to handle whether through death or disability) such Tax Return
matters after the Closing Date, the Company's outside auditors with respect to
the Company's consolidated financial statements shall be responsible for the
preparation of the draft Pre-Acquisition Returns described in this Section
7.10(a)(i).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-58-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The parties acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding the provisions
concerning the preparation of the draft Pre-Acquisition Returns, the Purchaser
has the ultimate responsibility to have prepared, timely filed and to have one
of its authorized officers execute all such Pre-Acquisition Returns.
Accordingly, the Majority Shareholder shall ensure that each of the draft Pre-
Acquisition Returns, together with the related supporting information, shall
be provided to the Purchaser no later than the applicable date specified
below:

  

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

Tax Period Ending December 31, 2010 - August 1, 2011;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

Tax Period for the Excluded Subsidiaries ending on the date on which
Distribution of Excluded Subsidiaries occurs - August 1, 2012; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

Tax Period Ending on Closing Date - August 1, 2012.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(iii) Upon receipt thereof, the Purchaser shall have the right to review and
provide comments on such draft Pre-Acquisition Return to the Majority
Shareholder. If the Purchaser disagrees with the amount of Taxes, other
calculations or one or more return positions reflected on such draft Pre-
Acquisition Return, it shall provide written notification thereof (a "Tax
Dispute Notice") to the Majority Shareholder at least thirty (30) days before
the due date for the filing of such draft Pre-Acquisition Return, after which
the parties shall cause their respective tax advisors to confer in good faith
to mutually resolve such disagreement. If the Majority Shareholder and the
Purchaser are unable to resolve such disagreement within ten (10) days after
the receipt of the Tax Dispute Notice, then such disagreement shall be
resolved by the Accounting Referee pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 3.4(c). To the extent permitted by Law, the Tax Returns described in
clause (ii)(A) in this Section 7.10(a) shall reflect the Company's address set
forth in the notice provision in Section 12.1 hereof. In the event the
Purchaser or the Majority Shareholder receives any notice or correspondence
from the IRS or any relevant Tax authority related to any Pre-Acquisition
Return, such Party shall promptly provide the other Party with a copy of such
notice or correspondence.

  

  

(iv) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or
cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are
not income Tax Returns. At least fifteen (15) Business Days before the due
date for the filing of such non-income Tax Returns, Purchaser shall furnish
draft copies of such Tax Returns, along with supporting information to the
Majority Shareholder who, along with his tax advisors, shall have the
opportunity to review such draft Tax Returns. If the Majority Shareholder
disagrees with the amount of Taxes, other calculations or one or more return
positions reflected on such draft Tax Returns, it shall provide written
notification thereof at least five (5) days before the due date of such Tax
Returns after which the parties shall cause their respective tax advisors to
confer in good faith to mutually resolve such disagreement. Notwithstanding
the time periods set forth above, the Purchaser shall be free to file such Tax
Returns by their respective due dates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-59-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Certain Closing Date Tax Matters. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
on the Closing Date the Company and the Subsidiaries will become members of
the Purchaser's consolidated group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-1(h)). In this regard, Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) provides that the Company and the Subsidiaries will
become members of the Purchaser's consolidated group at the end of the day on
the Closing Date, and that the Company's status changes and the Company's tax
year ends for all federal income tax purposes at the end of that day (the "End
of the Day Rule"). Pursuant to this End of the Day Rule, the Parties agree for
all applicable Tax purposes that: (i) the Closing Date shall be the last day
included in Pre-Acquisition Returns; (ii) the income, gain, loss, deduction
and credit of the Company and the Subsidiaries properly recognizable by them
on the Closing Date for Tax purposes will be reported on such Pre-Acquisition
Returns; (iii) the actual sale of the Shares by the Shareholders shall be
deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the "end of the day" (the
"Shareholders' Sale Event"); and (iv) all of the transactions that the
Majority Shareholder, the ESOP, the Company, the Excluded Subsidiaries and the
Subsidiaries have consummated on such Closing Date shall be reflected on such
Pre-Acquisition Returns as having occurred prior to the Shareholders' Sale
Event. None of the Parties hereto shall take any Tax Return position
inconsistent with the provisions of the previous sentence.

  

  

(c) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to
be timely filed, any Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date
("Straddle Tax Periods").

  

  

(d) Payment of Taxes. The Majority Shareholder shall be responsible for, and
shall indemnify the Purchaser from and against, any Tax with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Tax Returns were filed prior
to the Closing Date as well as any Pre-Closing Tax Period covered by a Pre-
Acquisition Return) or to that portion of a Straddle Tax Period that ends on
the Closing Date, in each case to the extent that such Tax exceeds the amount
(if any) reflected as a current liability for such Tax in the Final Working
Capital Schedule. Within five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for the
payment of any such Tax, if the amount of such Tax for which the Majority
Shareholder is responsible pursuant to this Section 7.10(d) exceeds the amount
reflected as a current liability for such Tax in the Final Working Capital
Schedule, the Majority Shareholder shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal
to such excess. For purposes of this Section 7.10(d), in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Tax
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other
than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period, any (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or
receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
Tax period ended on the Closing Date. The Parties agree that the Tax indemnity
obligations set forth in the first sentence of this Section 7.10(d) shall be
governed by the terms, conditions, procedures and limitations of Article XI of
this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-60-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Post-Closing Tax Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods
which begin after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Tax Returns"), provided
that the first Post-Closing Tax Return filed for federal income tax purposes
shall reflect the adoption by the Company and the Subsidiaries of the accrual
method by accounting. Subject to Section 7.10(h) hereof, the Purchaser shall
pay and hold harmless the Shareholders from and against any Taxes imposed with
respect to, or otherwise attributable to, the Tax periods which begin after
the Closing Date. The Parties agree that the Tax indemnity obligations set
forth in the first sentence of this Section 7.10(e) shall be governed by the
terms, conditions, procedures and limitations of Article XI of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Amended Returns. Without the prior written consent of the Majority
Shareholder, the Purchaser shall not: (i) amend any Tax Return with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) extend or waive any statute of limitations
or other period for the assessment of any Tax imposed with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which the Majority Shareholder may be liable to the
Purchaser under Section 7.10(d) or Section 11.1(e); provided, however, that
upon the request of the Majority Shareholder or as otherwise required by Law,
the Purchaser shall amend a Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period if such amendment is necessary to make conforming changes that are
consistent with the results of an audit or other examination of a Tax Return
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period any Governmental Entity. The
Purchaser and the Majority Shareholder shall attempt to agree on the form of
any such amended return prior to the filing thereof. If the Purchaser and
Majority Shareholder are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after
the form of amended return is delivered by the Purchaser to the Majority
Shareholder, then such disagreement shall be resolved by the Accounting
Referee pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3.4(c).

  

  

(g) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (as well as amounts credited against Tax to which they become
entitled) that relate to either: (i) a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) the
portion of the Straddle Tax Periods allocated to the Majority Shareholder
pursuant to Section 7.10(d), shall be for the account of the Majority
Shareholder and shall be paid to him within fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt of such refund or credit against Tax.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-61-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Deferred Tax Assets. The Majority Shareholder shall be responsible for,
and shall indemnify the Purchaser from and against, that portion of any
additional Taxes payable by the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary as a result of the reduction or disallowance of any deferred tax
asset included in Current Assets for purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital as further described in this Section 7.10(h). In the event that the
determination of the Final Working Capital Schedule under Section 3.4 resulted
in a Working Capital Deficit, the Majority Shareholder shall pay to the
Purchaser, within ten (10) days after the amount of any such additional Taxes
is finally determined (i) upon the filing of the Pre-Acquisition Consolidated
Return, (ii) by the applicable Governmental Entity or (iii) by mutual
agreement of the Majority Shareholder and the Purchaser, an amount equal to
the full amount of such additional Taxes. In the event that the determination
of the Final Working Capital Schedule under Section 3.4 did not result in a
Working Capital Deficit, the Majority Shareholder shall pay to the Purchaser,
within ten (10) days after the amount of any such additional Taxes is finally
determined as provided above, an amount equal to only the amount of such
additional Taxes that would have caused a Working Capital Deficit had the
reduction or disallowance of any deferred tax asset included in Current Assets
for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital been known at the time of the
determination of the Final Working Capital Schedule under Section 3.4. In
addition, in the event that the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary decides to contest the imposition of such additional Taxes in a
forum that requires the prior payment of such additional Taxes in order to
pursue such contest, the Majority Shareholder shall advance to the Purchaser
an amount equal to the amount of such additional Taxes which the Majority
Shareholder is otherwise obligated to pay under this Section 7.10(h) within
ten (10) days after the Purchaser provides written notice of such decision to
the Majority Shareholder. If all or any portion of such additional Taxes which
the Majority Shareholder is otherwise obligated to pay under this Section
7.10(h) are refunded to the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary, an amount equal to such refund, plus any interest paid by the
applicable Governmental Entity in connection with such refund, shall be paid
by the Purchaser to the Majority Shareholder within ten (10) days after the
receipt of such refund. The Parties agree that the Tax indemnity obligations
set forth in the first sentence of this Section 7.10(h) shall be governed by
the terms, conditions, procedures and limitations of Article XI of this
Agreement.

  

  

(i) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Purchaser, the Company and the Majority
Shareholder shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
Section 7.10 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) Transfer Taxes. Any Taxes or recording fees payable as a result of the
purchase and sale of the Shares or any other action contemplated hereby (other
than any federal, state, local or foreign Taxes measured by or based upon
income or gains imposed upon the Purchaser) shall be paid by the Majority
Shareholder. The Parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications and other documents
regarding Taxes and all transfer, recording, registration and other fees that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that
are required or permitted to be filed at or prior to the Closing.

  

  

(k) No 338 Election. The Purchaser agrees that it shall not make any election
pursuant to Section 338 of the Code with respect to the acquisition by the
Purchaser of the Shares as contemplated hereby.

  

  

(l) No Deconsolidation. Parent and Purchaser agree with the Company and the
Subsidiaries that in order to prevent any deconsolidation or termination of
the "consolidated group" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section1.1502-1(h)) of which the Company and the Subsidiaries are members as
of the Closing Date, (i) Parent shall include the Company and the Subsidiaries
in the "consolidated group" of which Parent is the common parent and Purchaser
is a member for the first federal consolidated income Tax Post-Closing Tax
Return for the Tax period beginning on the day after the Closing Date, and
(ii) Company and each of the Subsidiaries shall consent to join in the filing
of a consolidated return with and as part of the Parent's consolidated group
in the manner prescribed in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-75(b)(1).

  

  

Section 7.11 Customer and Employee Visits. During the period commencing on the
date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, at such times as shall be mutually
agreed to among the Company, the Majority Shareholder and the Purchaser, and
subject to reasonable limitations agreed to among the Company, the Majority
Shareholder and the Purchaser, the Company and the Majority Shareholder shall
permit the Purchaser to discuss and meet, and shall cooperate in such
discussions and meetings, with the key employees and any five (5) Customers of
the Company that the Purchaser so requests. The Majority Shareholder or a
senior executive of the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser shall
have the right to accompany the Purchaser's representative to such meeting and
shall participate with the Purchaser's representative in any such discussions.
The Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser if any Contract between the
Company or any Subsidiary and any Customer or key employee terminates during
the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 7.12 Affiliate Loans. The Company shall cause all notes and accounts
receivable and payable of the Company owing by or to any Shareholder or any
director, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Company (each, an "Affiliate
Loan") to be paid in full prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
the term Affiliate Loan shall not include intercompany receivables (payables)
between the Company and any of the Subsidiaries or between one or more of the
Subsidiaries as reflected in the current asset section of their respective
balance sheets.

Section 7.13 Release. In consideration for the Purchase Price, as of and
following the Closing Date, each Shareholder knowingly, voluntarily and
unconditionally releases, forever discharges, and covenants not to sue the
Acquired Companies from or for any and all claims, causes of action, demands,
suits, debts, obligations, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) of every kind or nature whatsoever, known or
unknown, actual or potential, suspected or unsuspected, fixed or contingent,

release shall not apply to any claims arising out of this Agreement.

Section 7.17 Pre-Closing Affiliate Transfers. Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Majority Shareholder shall have caused the Excluded
Subsidiaries to transfer the Transferred Assets to the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the manner set forth in assignment and/or transfer
agreements satisfactory to the Purchaser and Company (the "Transferred Assets
Assignment Agreements"), such that, following such transfers, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall own all assets related to and necessary and sufficient
to operate the Business, and all assets that have been used by the Company and
the Subsidiaries in the past, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens (the "Pre-Closing Affiliate Transfers"). The Majority Shareholder shall
ensure that all such transfers are valid and made in compliance with all
applicable Laws.

this Agreement, but subsequent to the Pre-Closing Affiliate Transfers, the

Excluded Subsidiaries and VES Group are intended to be tax-free under Section
355(a) and 351 of the Code, respectively. The transactions described in this

Subsidiaries."

  

  

Section 7.19 ESOP Transactions. The Majority Shareholder covenants as follows:

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing and the ESOP Sale described in subsection (b) below,
(i) the ESOP shall be assumed by VES Group, and (ii) the ESOP shall be amended
to change the plan sponsor, plan administrator and named fiduciary from the
Company to VES Group.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Trustees shall have sold all of the ESOP Shares
to the Majority Shareholder (the "ESOP Sale") for Twenty-Five Million Four
Hundred Thirty-Nine Thousand Six Hundred Fifty-Eight and 11/100 Dollars
($25,439,658.11) in cash ("ESOP Purchase Price"). Neither the ESOP nor the
Trustees shall have any liability of any kind to any broker, finder, agent or
other Person for any commission or similar compensation with respect to the
ESOP Sale. Prior to the ESOP Sale, the Trustees shall have obtained an opinion
from a qualified independent appraiser that the ESOP Purchase Price payable
for the ESOP Shares is not less than "adequate consideration" within the
meaning of Section 3(18) of ERISA and the terms and conditions of the ESOP
Sale (taking into account the subsequent transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) are fair and reasonable to the ESOP from a financial point of view.
The independent appraisal and appraiser shall satisfy all the requirements of
the Code Section 401(a)(18) and DOC Prop. Reg Section 2510-3(18). Prior to the
ESOP Sale, Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, P.L.C., counsel for VES Group
with respect to ESOP matters, shall have furnished an opinion to VES Group and
to the Purchaser stating that neither the sale of the ESOP Shares by the ESOP
nor any aspect of the ESOP's or Trustees' participation in ESOP Sale will
constitute a prohibited transaction under Sections 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the
Code and that the consummation of the ESOP Sale will not violate any of the
terms and conditions of, result in a material modification of, or constitute
(or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute) a default under the
ESOP plan document, trust agreement or any material instrument, contract or
other agreement to which the ESOP is a party or by or to which it or its
assets or properties are bound or subject. Prior to the ESOP Sale, the
Trustees shall have determined, independently and in good faith, that the ESOP
Sale is prudent and in the best interests of ESOP participants and that ESOP
Purchase Price is not less than "adequate consideration" within the meaning of
Section 3(18)(B) of ERISA and that the terms and conditions of the ESOP Sale
(taking into account the subsequent transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) are fair to the ESOP from a financial point of view.

Section 11.3 Indemnification Procedure.

  

  

(a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third
party (including any Governmental Entity) of any complaint, dispute or claim
or the commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding
(including with respect to Tax matters addressed in Section 7.10) with respect
to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant
hereto (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall provide written
notice thereof to the Party obligated to indemnify under this Agreement (the
"Indemnifying Party"); provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim only if the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure to notify, including where such failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying
Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days thereafter, to undertake, conduct and control the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, including the employment of counsel of its own choosing
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees
and disbursements of such counsel. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the Third-Party
Claim on the terms provided above or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, in either case within such thirty (30)-day period,
then any Purchaser Losses or any Shareholder Losses (as the case may be),
shall include the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Indemnified Party as incurred. In any Third-Party Claim for which
indemnification is being sought hereunder the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its
own counsel at such Party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all times use commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party (as the
case may be) reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter
the defense of which it is maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with
each other with respect to the defense of any such matter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-75-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such claim
pursuant to Section 11.3(a) or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and its officers,
directors, employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out of, or
related to, such Third-Party Claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out of, or related to,
such Third-Party Claim, (y) does not contain any admission or statement
suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and
(z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner
affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or
any of the Indemnified Party's Affiliates.

  

  

(c) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant
hereto with respect to any matter not involving a third party complaint,
dispute or claim (a "Direct Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall send written
notice of such Direct Claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party (a "Notice
of Claim") promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the facts
that form the basis for such Direct Claim. Such Notice of Claim shall specify
the basis for such Direct Claim and the amount owed by the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such Claim, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party
or, if not known, as estimated in good faith by the Indemnified Party. The
failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such
Indemnified Party with respect to any Direct Claim made pursuant to this
Section 11.3(c) except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
by such failure to notify. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such
Notice of Claim that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this Article XI or the amount thereof, the Direct
Claim, only to the extent and as to the amount specified or estimated by the
Indemnified Party in such Notice of Claim, shall be deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party under this Article XI, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the Direct Claim (or any portion of
the Direct Claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such
Direct Claim (or such portion of such Direct Claim) becomes finally
determined. In the event the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such Direct Claim as provided above, as promptly as
possible, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall
establish the merits and amount of such Direct Claim (by mutual agreement,
litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days
following the final determination of the merits and amount of such Direct
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party immediately
available funds in an amount equal to such Direct Claim as determined
hereunder.

Section 11.4 Survival Period. The representations and warranties of the
Parties contained herein shall not be extinguished by the Closing, but shall
survive the Closing for, and all claims for indemnification in connection
therewith shall be asserted not later than, twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) each of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.1(a)-(d) (Organization), Section 4.2
(Authorization), Section 5.1 (Authorization and Validity of Agreement),
Section 5.3 (Ownership of Equity), Section 6.1 (Organization), Section 6.2
(Authorization) and Section 6.4 (Issuance of Shares) shall survive the Closing
without limitation as to time, and the period during which a claim for
indemnification may be asserted in connection therewith shall continue
indefinitely, (b) each of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.7(b) (Title to Assets), Section 4.15 (Tax Returns; Taxes), Section
4.17 (Company Benefit Plans), Section 4.23 (Affiliate Matters) and Section
4.30 (Brokers, Finders and Investment Bankers) shall continue until, and all
claims for indemnification in connection therewith shall be asserted not later
than, the latest date a claim may be asserted pursuant to any applicable
statute of limitations (or indefinitely, if no such statute of limitations
applies). The covenants and agreements of the Parties hereunder that involve
actions to be taken prior to the Closing shall survive until the Closing;
provided that nothing herein shall be construed to limit a Party's right to
recovery with respect to a breach of any such covenant or agreement which
occurred prior to the Closing. The covenants and agreements of the Parties
hereunder that involve actions to be taken or obligations in effect after the
Closing shall survive in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last day a claim for
indemnification may be asserted hereunder, an Indemnifying Party shall have
been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall
not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms
hereof.

Section 11.5 Liability Limits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against
the Majority Shareholder for indemnification under Section 11.1(a) for
Purchaser Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of such Purchaser
Losses exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Deductible"), in which
event the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may claim indemnification for all such
Purchaser Losses in excess of the Deductible, up to, but not to exceed Forty
Million Dollars ($40,000,000)(the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
the Deductible shall not apply to any Purchaser Losses arising out of or
related to a breach of Section 4.7(b) (Title to Assets), Section 4.17 (Company
Benefit Plans), Section 4.22(d) (Licensed Intellectual Property), Section 4.23
(Affiliate Matters) or Section 4.30 (Brokers, Finders and Investment Bankers),
and the Majority Shareholder shall be liable for all Purchaser Losses with
respect thereto, up to, but not to exceed the Cap, and (b) the Deductible and
the Cap shall not apply to any Purchaser Losses arising out of or related to
fraud or a breach of Section 4.1(a)-(d) (Organization), Section 4.2
(Authorization), Section 5.1 (Authorization and Validity of Agreement),
Section 5.3 (Ownership of Equity) or Section 4.15 (Tax Returns; Taxes), any
such Purchaser Losses shall not be aggregated toward the Cap, and the Majority
Shareholder shall be liable for all Purchaser Losses with respect thereto.

  

  

Section 11.6 Insurance and Third-Party Indemnification. If any Indemnifying
Party is required to make payments to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article XI, then following the time the Indemnified Party receives such
payments from the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to receive from the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party (a) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification
agreement with any third party, or (b) any insurance proceeds or other cash
receipts or sources of reimbursement actually collected by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Losses, less any fees and expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in collecting such amounts under (a) or (b), up to the
amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such indemnity claim; provided that, other than using
commercially reasonable efforts to file a claim for covered Losses under (a)
or (b) and to use commercially reasonable efforts to follow up on such initial
filing, the Indemnified Party shall not be required to pursue collection or
recovery of any amounts under (a) or (b) from any insurer or third party,
whether by litigation or otherwise.

  

  

Section 11.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of fraud by any Party and
except in the case of breaches of Section 7.9 hereto, the Purchaser and the
Majority Shareholder agree that the indemnification provisions under this
Article XI shall be their sole and exclusive remedy for any claims or causes
of action for money damages arising out of, based upon or resulting from the
provisions of this Agreement, any Ancillary Document (except for claims under
any Ancillary Document against Persons that are not a party to this Agreement)
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and waive to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law any and all such other claims or causes of
action for money damages, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, and
whether asserted at law or in equity.

construed and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of
Delaware without reference to its choice of law rules. Except with respect to

extension or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a
Party of the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
waiver by any Party of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be
performed at a later time. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by written agreement of the Parties.

ESCROW AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of ________, 2011, is
entered into by and among ExamWorks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Purchaser"), George C. Turek (the "Shareholder"), the majority shareholder of
MES Group, Inc., and Branch Banking and Trust Company, a North Carolina
banking corporation, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, the Purchaser, the Company, the Shareholder and the other equity
holders of the Company have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement") dated as of January 11, 2011, pursuant to which the
Purchaser has agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of MES Group, Inc. (the "Company") from the Shareholder and all
of the other equity holders of the Company on the date hereof;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement provides for the establishment of a cash
escrow, a portion of which will secure the obligation of the Shareholder to
pay the amount of any Working Capital Deficit under Section 3.4(d) of the
Purchase Agreement and the amount of any indemnification obligation of the
Shareholder under Article XI of the Purchase Agreement, and a portion of which
represents a deposit by the Company for the payment of Separation Costs to
Separated Persons under Section 7.8(c) of the Purchase Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is willing to act as the escrow agent hereunder.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration of the
mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained herein
and in the Purchase Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

1. Appointment of the Escrow Agent. The Purchaser and the Shareholder hereby appoint and designate the Escrow Agent as escrow agent to receive, hold, invest and disburse the Escrow Fund (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent hereby accepts its appointment as the escrow agent and agrees to receive, hold, invest and disburse the initial deposit of the Escrow Fund and any income, interest or other amounts received thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

2. Establishment of Escrow Fund.

  

  

2.1. Escrow Fund.

  

  

(a) Receipt of the Escrow Amount. Simultaneously with the execution hereof,
(i) the Purchaser has delivered to the Escrow Agent, out of the Purchase
Price, Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) in cash (the "Escrow Deposit") and
(b) the Company has delivered to the Escrow Agent [Maximum of Eight Hundred
Sixty Thousand Dollars ($860,000)] in cash (the "Separation Costs Deposit"
and, together with the Escrow Deposit, the "Escrow Fund"). Any interest or
other income earned on the Escrow Fund shall not become part of the Escrow
Fund and shall be disbursed to the Shareholder on a monthly basis. The Escrow
Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Fund.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.2. Investment of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest
the Escrow Fund in (i) certificates of deposit issued, or a money market
account maintained, by federally chartered banks or trust companies, the
assets of which are at least $100,000,000 in excess of their liabilities (the
parties acknowledge that Escrow Agent meets this qualification), (ii)
commercial paper rated in the highest grade by a nationally recognized credit
rating agency, (iii) United States Treasury Bills (or an investment portfolio
or fund investing only in United States Treasury Bills), (iv) a money market
fund, or (v) such other interest-bearing investments as jointly approved in
writing by the Purchaser and the Shareholder. Unless instructed otherwise in
writing by the Purchaser and the Shareholder, the Escrow Agent shall invest
all funds held pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the Investment
Selection Instructions set forth as Exhibit A hereto.

  

  

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss resulting from
investments made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. On or
before the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall provide to the Escrow Agent a completed Form W-9 or Form W-8,
whichever is appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
provided, the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any Federal
or state tax report or return with respect to any funds held pursuant to this
Agreement or any income earned thereon.

  

  

Each of the foregoing investments shall be made in the name of the Escrow
Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Escrow
Agent shall, without notice to the Purchaser or the Shareholder, sell or
liquidate any of the foregoing investments derived from the Escrow Fund at any
time if the proceeds thereof are required for any release of funds permitted
or required hereunder, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible
for any loss, cost or penalty resulting from any such sale or liquidation. The
Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with its investment or
reinvestment of the Escrow Fund held by it hereunder in good faith, in
accordance with the terms hereof, including, but not limited to, any liability
for any delays (not resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct)
in the investment or reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or any loss of interest
incident to such delays.

  

  

2.3. Disbursement of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Deposit portion of the Escrow
Fund shall secure the obligation of the Shareholder to pay the amount of any
Working Capital Deficit under Section 3.4(d) of the Purchase Agreement and the
amount of any indemnification obligation of the Shareholder under Article XI
of the Purchase Agreement. The Separation Costs Deposit portion of the Escrow
Fund represents a deposit by the Company for the payment of Separation Costs
to Separated Persons under Section 7.8(c) of the Purchase Agreement.
Capitalized Terms used herein, but not defined herein, shall have the meanings
given such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

  

  

(a) In the event that the Escrow Agent receives a joint written instruction
signed by the Purchaser and the Shareholder directing the disbursement of all
or part of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Fund in
accordance with such instruction. The Escrow Agent shall rely conclusively and
without inquiry on any information contained in such instruction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event that the Escrow Agent receives a written instruction signed
by the Purchaser directing the disbursement of all or part of the Separation
Costs Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Separation Costs Deposit in
accordance with such instruction. The Escrow Agent shall rely conclusively and
without inquiry on any information contained in such instruction. At the time
any such instruction is provided to the Escrow Agent, the Purchaser shall
provide a copy of such instruction to the Shareholder.

  

  

(c) Other than pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or (b), a disbursement of the Escrow
Fund shall be subject to compliance with the following procedures:

  

  

(i) in the event that a Purchaser Indemnified Party desires to make a claim
against the Escrow Fund on account of, or with respect to, the obligation of
the Shareholder to pay the amount of any Working Capital Deficit under Section
3.4(d) of the Purchase Agreement or the amount of any indemnification
obligation of the Shareholder under Article XI of the Purchase Agreement (a
"Claim"), it shall notify the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder in writing (a
"Notice of Claim"), which notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity
(A) a description of the Claim and (B) the amount owed by the Shareholder with
respect to such Claim, to the extent then known by the Purchaser Indemnified
Party or, if not known, as estimated in good faith by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party.

  

  

(ii) In the event that the Shareholder disputes that the Purchaser Indemnified
Party is entitled to be paid by the Escrow Agent all or any portion of the
amounts set forth in such Notice of Claim, the Shareholder shall notify the
Escrow Agent and the Purchaser Indemnified Party of such dispute in writing
within thirty (30) days after the Escrow Agent's and the Shareholder's receipt
of the Notice of Claim. If no such written notice of dispute is received by
the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days after the Escrow Agent and the
Shareholder have received a Notice of Claim, the Escrow Agent shall release
from the Escrow Deposit portion of the Escrow Fund and deliver to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party identified in such Notice of Claim such amount of
the Claim specified therein. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to assume,
without inquiry, that any signatory to a Notice of Claim identified therein as
a "Purchaser Indemnified Party" is a Purchaser Indemnified Party. For all
purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to assume,
without inquiry, that any signatory to a notice identified therein as a
"Shareholder" is the Shareholder.

  

  

(iii) In the event that the Shareholder disputes the Claim by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party and the Shareholder provides the Escrow Agent and the
Purchaser Indemnified Party with written notice of such dispute within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder of the Notice
of Claim, the Escrow Agent shall not pay the Claim except as it may be
directed (A) solely as to the amount of any Working Capital Deficit under
Section 3.4(d) of the Purchase Agreement, by a notice in writing signed by the
Purchaser or the Shareholder, which party shall provide concurrently a copy of
the notice to the other party hereunder, enclosing a copy of the Accounting
Referee's written determination of the Working Capital Schedule and the
Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any, based thereon, (B)
as to any other claim, by a notice in writing signed by the Purchaser or the
Shareholder, which party shall provide concurrently a copy of the notice to
the other party hereunder, enclosing a copy of a final order, decree or
judgment entered by a court or arbitral body of competent jurisdiction,
certified by the Clerk (or equivalent officer) of such court or arbitral body
(the time for appeal having expired and no appeal having been perfected)
directing the manner in which the amount of the Claim shall be distributed to
the Purchaser Indemnified Party and/or the Shareholder, or (C) by a notice in
writing signed jointly by the Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Shareholder.
Such disputed Claims are hereinafter referred to as "Disputed Unpaid Claims."
For purposes hereof, Disputed Unpaid Claims will be deemed to have been
resolved upon the Escrow Agent paying the Claim in accordance with clause (A),
(B) or (C) above or determining that the Purchaser Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be paid by the Escrow Agent any amount set forth in the Notice of
Claim in accordance with clause (A), (B) or (C) above. For purposes of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall rely conclusively and without inquiry on any
document purporting to be a determination by the Accounting Referee of the
Final Working Capital Schedule.

2.4. Release of Funds. On the date that is sixty (60) days following the date
hereof, the Escrow Agent shall distribute and release to the Shareholder the
balance of the Separation Costs Deposit. In the event that on the twelve
(12)-month anniversary on the date hereof, no Claim is pending pursuant to a
Notice of Claim theretofore received by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent
shall distribute and release to the Shareholder the balance of the Escrow Fund
(including interest and earnings included thereon), if any. If on such date
one or more Claims are pending pursuant to a Notice of Claim theretofore
received by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain in escrow such
amount as shall be sufficient to satisfy the amount of the Claim specified in
any applicable Notices(s) of Claim, and release and distribute to the
Shareholder the remaining balance, if any. Upon resolution of all Disputed
Unpaid Claims, the Escrow Agent shall immediately release to the Shareholder
the remaining balance, if any of the Escrow Fund.

  

  

3. Termination of the Escrow Fund. This Agreement shall terminate on the first to occur of (i) the disbursement of the entire Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof or (ii) a mutual consent jointly signed by the Purchaser and the Shareholder and which provides for the disbursement of the Escrow Fund.

  

  

4. Covenant of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees and covenants with the Purchaser and the Shareholder that it shall perform all of its obligations under this Agreement in its capacity as escrow agent and shall not deliver custody or possession of any of the Escrow Fund to anyone except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law.

  

  

5. Resignation and Removal of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent, or any successor, may resign from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Purchaser and the Shareholder or may be removed, with or without cause, by the Purchaser and the Shareholder acting jointly at any time by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent. Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent as provided herein. Upon any such notice of resignation or removal, the Purchaser and the Shareholder shall appoint a successor escrow agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial bank, trust company or other financial institution with a combined capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, unless otherwise agreed by the parties hereto. Upon the acceptance in writing of any appointment as the Escrow Agent hereunder by a successor escrow agent, such successor escrow agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Escrow Agent, and the retiring Escrow Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement, but shall not be discharged from any liability for actions taken as Escrow Agent hereunder prior to such succession. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein provided, in the event the Escrow Agent resigns as Escrow Agent hereunder and no successor escrow agent has been designated and accepted appointment as successor Escrow Agent within forty-five (45) days following the date of the Escrow Agent's notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to deposit all property held pursuant to this Agreement into the registry of any court of competent jurisdiction and notify the parties hereto of such deposit, and thereupon the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from all further duties and responsibilities as Escrow Agent under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the appointment of a successor escrow agent hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agent's resignation or removal, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6. Liability of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein and shall have no implied duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability or obligation with respect to the Escrow Fund or this Agreement except for the Escrow Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Escrow Agent may rely upon any instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or presented by the person or parties purporting to sign the same and to conform to the provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or question of the construction of this Agreement or seek the assistance of a court of competent jurisdiction, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with the advice or instruction of such counsel or such court, except, in either case, in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence by the Escrow Agent. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages. The Escrow Agent shall not be charged with or be deemed to have any knowledge or notice of any notice, fact or circumstance not specifically set forth in this Agreement or furnished to the Escrow Agent in notices provided to the Escrow Agent in writing and strictly in accordance with the notice provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of any agreement or understanding, including but not limited to the Purchase Agreement among the parties hereto, other than this Agreement and shall have no duty or responsibility to take any action pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds effected by the Escrow Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions provided to the Escrow Agent by any party to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or to commence any proceedings in connection with this Agreement or any funds held hereunder or to appear in, prosecute or defend in any such legal action or proceedings. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible in any respect for the form, execution, validity, value or genuineness of documents or securities deposited hereunder, or for any description therein, or for the identity, authority or rights of persons executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver any such document, security or endorsement. The Purchaser and the Shareholder hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and each of its officers, directors, employees and agents against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation and counsel fees and disbursements, of every nature whatsoever which may be imposed upon the Escrow Agent or any such officer, director, employee or agent or incurred by the Escrow Agent or any such officer, director, employee or agent, directly or indirectly, in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agent's acceptance of appointment as escrow agent hereunder, or the performance of its duties hereunder, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving the subject matter hereof or the cash deposited hereunder; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall not be indemnified or held harmless in the event of losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from the Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. This indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7. Compensation of the Escrow Agent. The Shareholder and the Purchaser jointly and severally agree to compensate the Escrow Agent for performing its duties hereunder and to reimburse the Escrow Agent in accordance with Schedule 1 attached hereto, excluding any expenses incurred by reason of any claim against Escrow Agent for gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of fiduciary duty. Solely between the Shareholder and the Purchaser, the Shareholder and the Purchaser shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder, to the extent set forth on such Schedule 1.

  

  

8. Miscellaneous.

Agreement and is hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full herein.

  

  

8.2. Assignment; Successors in Interest. No assignment or transfer by any
party of such party's rights and obligations hereunder shall be made except
with the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that the
Purchaser shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior written consent of
any other party, be entitled to assign this Agreement or all or any part of
its rights or obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates of the Purchaser
or to the Purchaser's lenders under its credit facilities, with a copy of such
assignment sent to the Shareholder. In the case of such an assignment to one
or more Affiliates of the Purchaser, such Affiliate(s) shall be the
"Purchaser" for all purposes hereunder, however, ExamWorks, Inc. shall remain
jointly and severally liable for all obligations of the Purchaser hereunder.
In the event of any such proposed assignment, an amendment to this Agreement
to change the name to the assignee, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Escrow Agent, shall be executed and delivered in the event
the Escrow Agent deems such an amendment to be necessary or desirable. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and any reference to a
party shall also be a reference to the successors and permitted assigns
thereof.

only as a matter of convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit,
extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or the intent of any provision
hereof.

  

  

8.4. Severability. Any provision hereof that is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by law, each party hereby
waives any provision of law that renders any such provision prohibited or
unenforceable in any respect.

  

  

8.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,

intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give any person other than
the parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, any right, remedy,
obligation or liability under or by reason of this Agreement, or result in
such person being deemed a third-party beneficiary hereof.

  

  

8.7. Waiver; Amendment. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension
or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. A waiver by a party of
the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
waiver by any party of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be
performed at a later time. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by written agreement of the parties.

  

  

8.8. Integration. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement supersede all

without the joinder of the other parties, the enforcing parties may request
the other parties to join in any suit to prosecute the Infringement Claim, at
the enforcing parties' expense. The enforcing parties shall have sole control

ExamWorks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Subsidiary"), and ExamWorks
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Parent" and, together with the
Subsidiary, the "Companies").

  

  

WHEREAS, the Investor is the majority shareholder of MES Group, Inc., a
Michigan corporation ("MES");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Parent is the sole shareholder of the Subsidiary;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Subsidiary intends to acquire all of the shares of MES (the
"Transaction") pursuant to a stock purchase agreement by and among the
Companies, the Investor, the additional minority shareholders of MES, and MES
(the "Purchase Agreement");

  

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Parent will issue 1,424,501
shares of common stock to the Investor as a portion of the purchase price in
the Transaction (the "Parent Stock");

  

  

WHEREAS, the shares of Parent Stock are not registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in reliance upon certain exemptions from
registration provided by the Act, including Section 4(2) of the Act and
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Regulation D requires, among other things, that prior to making a
sale of the Parent Stock, the Parent must have reasonable grounds to believe,
and shall believe after reasonable inquiry, that the offeree is an "accredited
investor" (as defined in Regulation D).

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual benefits to each party, the
parties, intended to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  

  

 

1) Parent Stock. The Parent agrees to issue the Parent Stock in book-entry
form to the Investor, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the closing of
the Transaction.

  

  

2) Representations of Investor. The Investor represents, warrants, and
acknowledges the following:

  

  

 

a) Market Conditions. The Investor is not acquiring shares of the Parent Stock
with any present intention of distributing or selling such shares in violation
of federal, state or other securities laws. The Investor agrees that he will
not sell, transfer, offer for sale, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose
of the shares of Parent Stock in violation of any federal, state or other
securities laws. The Investor acknowledges that the Parent Stock is subject to
market and other conditions beyond the control of the Companies.

 

  

  

b) Reliance upon the Investor's Representations. The Investor understands that
the Parent Stock is being offered and sold to him in reliance on specific
exemptions from the registration requirements of the United States federal
securities laws and that the Companies are relying on the truth and accuracy
of, and the Investor's compliance with, the representations, warranties,
agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of the Investor set forth
herein and in the Purchase Agreement in order to determine the availability of
such exemptions and the eligibility of the Investor to acquire the Parent
Stock.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

c) Accredited Investor. The Investor is an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Act.

 

  

  

 

d) Restricted Securities. The Investor understands that the Parent Stock to be
received by the Investor pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold,
transferred, or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an
exemption therefrom. In connection therewith, Parent will cause Parent's
transfer agent and registrar to include a notation, with respect to the book-
entry Parent Stock issued to Investor, that the Parent Stock is restricted.
Accordingly, the Investor acknowledges that the Investor is able and willing
to bear the economic risk of the investment in the Parent Stock for an
indefinite period of time.

 

  

  

 

e) Experience. The Investor represents that he can bear the economic risk of
investment in securities which are not registered under the Act, and has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the Investor
is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Parent
Stock.

 

  

  

 

f) Access to Information. The Investor agrees and acknowledges that he has
received or otherwise has had access to, and has had an opportunity to review,
examine and ask questions relating to, such information regarding the Parent
and its proposed business as he deems necessary for him to make an informed
decision regarding the investment in the Parent, including, without
limitation, all information and documents filed by the Parent with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

  

  

 

g) Insider Trading. The Investor understands that United States securities
laws prohibit any person who has material non-public information about a
company from purchasing or selling securities of such company or from
communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in
which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or
sell such securities.

 

  

  

 

3) Lock-Up. The Investor agrees to comply with the following lock-up
provisions for the Parent Stock.

 

  

  

 

a) Restrictions. The Investor agrees that, during the period specified in
Section 3(b) (the "Lock-Up Period"), the Investor will not lend, offer, sell,
contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or
otherwise dispose of the Parent Stock. The foregoing restriction is expressly
agreed to preclude the Investor from engaging in any hedging or other
transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead
to or result in a sale or disposition of the Investor's Parent Stock even if
such shares would be disposed of by someone other than the Investor. Such
prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any
short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without
limitation any put or call option) with respect to the Parent Stock or with
respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant
part of its value from such shares. Parent will cause Parent's transfer agent
and registrar to include a notation, with respect to the book-entry Parent
Stock issued to Investor, that the Parent Stock is subject to this Lock-Up
Period, which legend shall be removed upon the expiration of the Lock-Up
Period.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

b) Duration. The initial Lock-Up Period will continue for 180 days after
October 27, 2010, provided, however, that if (1) during the last 17 days of
the initial Lock-Up Period, the Parent releases earnings results or announces
material news or a material event relating to the Parent or (2) prior to the
expiration of the initial Lock-Up Period, the Parent announces that it will
release earnings results during the 15-day period following the last day of
the initial Lock-Up Period, then in each case the Lock-Up Period will be
automatically extended until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on
the date of release of the earnings results or the announcement of the
material news or material event relating to the Parent, as applicable, unless
each of Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (together,
the "Representatives"), as representatives of the underwriters in the Parent's
initial public offering (the "Underwriters"), waives, in writing, such
extension.

 

  

  

 

c) Notice. The Investor hereby acknowledges that the Parent agrees to provide
written notice of any event that would result in an extension of the Lock-Up
Period pursuant to Section 3(b) to the Investor and agrees that any such
notice properly delivered will be deemed to have been given to, and received
by, the Investor. The Investor hereby further agrees that, prior to engaging
in any transaction or taking any other action that is subject to the terms of
this Agreement during the period from the date of this Agreement to and
including the 34th day following the expiration of the initial Lock-Up Period,
it will give notice thereof to the Parent and will not consummate such
transaction or take any such action unless it has received written
confirmation from the Parent that the Lock-Up Period (as such may have been
extended pursuant to Section 3(b)) has expired.

  

  

 

d) Transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Investor may transfer the
Parent Stock (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee or
donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth
herein, (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the Investor
or the immediate family of the Investor, provided that the trustee of the
trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and
provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for
value, (iii) as a result of testate, intestate succession or bona fide estate
planning, provided that the transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the
restrictions set forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer
shall not involve a disposition for value (iv) to any affiliate of the
Investor, including its partners (if a partnership), members (if a limited
liability company), or wholly-owned subsidiary (if a corporation), provided
that the transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set
forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a
disposition for value or (v) with the prior written consent of each of the
Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters; provided that no filing by any
party (donor, donee, transferor or transferee) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 shall be required or shall be voluntarily made in connection with
any transfer (other than a filing on a Form 5 made after the expiration of the
Lock-Up Period) made pursuant to clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not restrict the Investor
from (a) purchasing shares of the Parent's common stock in open market
transactions or (b) acquiring equity awards issued by the Parent pursuant to
its equity incentive plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "immediate family"
shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote
than first cousin. The Investor also agrees and consents to the entry of stop
transfer instructions with the Parent's transfer agent and registrar against
the transfer of the Parent Stock except in compliance with the foregoing
restrictions.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

e) Successor in Interest. The Investor understands that this Lock-Up is
irrevocable and shall be binding upon the Investor's heirs, legal
representatives, successors, and assigns.

 

  

  

4) Representations of Parent. Parent represents, warrants and acknowledges the
following:   

  

 

a) Rule 144. Parent acknowledges that any sales by Investor, which are not
presently contemplated, made during the period six months after the date of
closing of the Transaction and prior to one year of the closing of the
Transaction will be made by Investor in reliance on Rule 144. Accordingly,
Parent agrees to file the reports required to be filed by it under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder in a timely manner.

 

  

  

 

b) Removal of Restrictive Notation. Parent will instruct its transfer agent
and registrar to remove the restrictive notation referenced in Section 2(d)
above, effective immediately on the first business day after six months from
the date of closing of the Transaction.
