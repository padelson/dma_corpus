Section 2.1 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of MLP GP, MLP, Parent GP, Parent or the
holder of any securities of MLP:

(a) (i) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to  _Section 2.1(c)_, _Section
2.2(h)_ and _Section 2.4_, each Common Unit issued and outstanding or deemed
issued and outstanding in accordance with _Section 2.3_ as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive (x)
$0.32 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (y) 0.4066 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") Parent Units (the " _Unit Consideration_ " and, together with the
Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(ii) _Conversion of MLP General Partner Interest_. The MLP General Partner
Interest outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive Parent GP Interests such that, immediately
following consummation of 

 



3  the GP Merger, and assuming exchange and conversion of all the Common Units,
Class F Units and Series A Units pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ and the Unit
Options pursuant to  _Section 2.3_, the Parent Percentage Interest
represented by the Parent GP Interests shall equal the sum of (x) the Parent
Percentage Interest represented by the Parent GP Interests immediately prior
to the Effective Time, as adjusted to give effect to the issuance of Parent
Units to be issued in connection with the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.1_
and _Section 2.3_, and (y) the MLP GP Percentage Interest. In connection
therewith, Parent GP shall receive a right to any capital account in MLP
associated with the MLP General Partner Interest immediately prior to the
Merger.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Class F Units_. Subject to _Section 2.1(c)_, _Section
2.2(h)_ and  _Section 2.4_, the Class F Units issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to have been converted
into an equal number of Common Units and such Common Units shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(i)_.

(iv) _Conversion of Series A Units_. Subject to _Section 2.1(c)_, _Section
2.2(h)_ and _Section 2.4_, each Series A Unit issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive a Series A preferred unit representing a limited partner interest in
Parent (a " _Parent Preferred Unit_ "), a new class of units in Parent
containing provisions substantially equivalent to the provisions set forth in
Section 5.14 of the MLP Partnership Agreement without abridgement including,
the same powers, preferences, rights to distributions, rights to accumulation
and compounding upon failure to pay distributions, and relative participating,
optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereon, that the Series A Units have immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Series A Unit Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Cancellation of MLP Incentive Distribution Rights_. The MLP Incentive
Distribution Rights outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist. In connection with such cancellation, Parent GP shall receive a right
to any capital account in MLP associated with the MLP Incentive Distribution
Rights immediately prior to the Merger.

(c) _Cancellation of MLP-Owned Units_. Any MLP Securities that are
owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by MLP or any Subsidiary of MLP
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled MLP Securities.

 

(d) _Partnership Interests of the Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
partnership interests in Parent that had been issued and are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and remain
outstanding.

 

(e) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units and Class F
Units converted into the Merger Consideration and all Series A Units
converted into the Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to
this _Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall

 



4  automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of units in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry
 Units_")) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
Common Units, Class F Units or Series A Units (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, any
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_
and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Units to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_, in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_, without interest, and the right to be admitted as a Parent
Limited Partner. Parent GP hereby consents to the admission (as a Parent
Limited Partner) of each MLP Unitholder who is issued Parent Units or Parent
Preferred Units in accordance with this _Article II_ , upon the proper
surrender of the Certificate representing Common Units, Class F Units or
Series A Units, as applicable. Upon such surrender of the Certificate (or upon
a waiver of the requirement to surrender a Certificate granted by Parent GP in
its sole discretion) and the recording of the name of such Person as a
limited partner of Parent on the books and records of Parent, such Person
shall automatically and effective as of the Effective Time be admitted as a
Parent Limited Partner and be bound by the Parent Partnership Agreement as
such. By its surrender of a Certificate, or by its acceptance of Parent Units
or Parent Preferred Units, as applicable, a MLP Unitholder confirms its
agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Parent
Partnership Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to MLP (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units for the Merger
Consideration and Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
three business days following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Common Units,
Class F Units and Series A Units as of the Effective Time (and, to the
extent commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand,
during customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, if so elected by such holder of record), whose Common Units, Class F
Units and Series A Units, as applicable, were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as
applicable, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates and Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such forms as MLP and Parent
may reasonably agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the
Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, and cash
in lieu of any fractional Parent Units payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_.

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units, Class F Units, Series A Units and Unit Options, an amount of (x) Parent
Units (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form), (y) Parent
Preferred Units (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) and (z)
cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to  _Section
2.1(a),_ _Section 2.3(b)_

 



5  and _Section 2.3(c)_, payable upon due surrender of the Certificates, Book-
Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Following
the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any
distributions pursuant to  _Section 2.2(g)_, any Parent Units sufficient to
pay any Merger Consideration and any Parent Preferred Units sufficient to pay
any Series A Unit Consideration, in each case, that may be payable from time
to time following the Effective Time. All cash and book-entry units
representing Parent Units and Parent Preferred Units deposited with the
Exchange Agent or representing unit proceeds obtained pursuant to _Section
2.2(h)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration and Series A Unit Consideration contemplated to be issued or
paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Common Units, Class F Units, Series A
Units or Unit Options entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu
of fractional interests pursuant to  _Section 2.3(a)_ and Parent shall
promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of holders of Common Units, Class F Units, Series A Units or Unit
Options entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such
losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days.

 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units, Class F Units and Series A Units
that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a Certificate
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), Book-Entry Unit or other
evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) in the case of a Common
Unitholder or Class F Unitholder, (x) the number of Parent Units representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Units that such holder has the
right to receive in accordance with the provisions of this _Article II_
and/or (y) a check denominated in U.S. dollars in the amount of cash that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_ , including the
Cash Consideration, and (ii) in the case of a Series A Unitholder, the number
of Parent Preferred Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
Parent Preferred Units that such holder has the right to receive in accordance
with the provisions of this  _Article II_. The Merger Consideration and
Series A Unit Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail
after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), Book-Entry Units or other evidence of
Unit Options and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, Series A Unit
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Units or on any unpaid
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration or Series A Unit
Consideration, as applicable. The Merger Consideration and Series A Unit
Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates, Book-Entry Units or other
evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Common Units, Class F Units, Series A

 



6  Units, Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), as the case may be, formerly represented
by such Certificates, Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Unit, or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate, Book-Entry Unit or
other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration is to be registered in the name
of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate, Book-Entry Unit or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) is registered, it shall be a condition to
the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration or Series A
Unit Consideration, as applicable, shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in
the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate,
Book-Entry Unit or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of MLP of transfers of Common Units,
Class F Units or Series A Units. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) representing Common Units,
Class F Units or Series A Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Units, Class F
Units or Series A Units, as applicable, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates,
Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Common Unitholders, Class F Unitholders, Series A
Unitholders or holders of Unit Options 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged such holders Common Units, Class F Units, Unit Options or Series A
Units for the Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as
applicable, in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration or
Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, in respect of such holders
Common Units, Class F Units, Unit Options or Series A Units. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and MLP shall not be liable to any Common Unitholder,
Class F Unitholder, Series A Unitholder or holders of Unit Options for any
Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, duly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws.
Any Merger Consideration or Series A Unit 

 



7  Consideration remaining unclaimed by Common Unitholders, Class F
Unitholders, Series A Unitholders or holders of Unit Options immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property
of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to Parent Units or Parent
Preferred Units issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates, Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) until such Certificates,
Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.2_.
Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of
the Parent Units or Parent Preferred Units, if any, issued in exchange
therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all distributions payable in
respect of any such Parent Units or Parent Preferred Units with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the distributions payable with respect to such Parent Units or Parent
Preferred Units with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of distributions in
respect of Parent Units or Parent Preferred Units, all Parent Units or Parent
Preferred Units to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Units or Parent Preferred Units shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, Book-Entry Units or other evidence of Unit Options
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common Units, Class F Units or
Unit Options converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Unit (after taking into account
all Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), Book-Entry
Units or other evidence of Unit Options (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) delivered by such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.2(h)_, a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of such fractional units
representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds
from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by reasonable and customary fees
of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) (as so reduced, the "unit
proceeds") in one or more transactions of a number of Parent Units,
such number equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of Parent Units
to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_
over (ii) the aggregate number of whole Parent Units to be distributed to
the holders of Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ (such excess, the "
_Excess Units_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash unit
proceeds in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip for fractional units was
not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional units. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Common Units, Class F Units or Unit Options that would otherwise
receive fractional Parent Units, shall sell the Excess Units at then-
prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner provided in this _Section
2.2(h)_ and such sales shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the unit proceeds of

 



8  such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of such Common
Units, Class F Units or Unit Options, or the Exchange Fund is terminated, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such unit proceeds in trust for the benefit of the
holders of such Common Units, Class F Units and Unit Options (the "
_Fractional Unit Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion
of the Fractional Unit Proceeds to which each holder of such Common Units,
Class F Units or Unit Options shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate unit proceeds comprising the Fractional Unit Proceeds
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
unit interest to which such holder of such Common Units, Class F Units or
Unit Options would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of fractional unit interests to which all holders of such
Common Units, Class F Units or Unit Options would otherwise be entitled.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Common Units, Class F Units or Series A Units, as applicable, represented
by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to a Common Unitholder, Class F Unitholder or Series A Unitholder such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision
of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and
withholding is required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in
Parent Units). To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
Common Units, Class F Units, Series A Units and Unit Options, as applicable,
in respect of whom such withholding was made. If withholding is taken in
Parent Units, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold
such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of
such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds
to the appropriate Tax authority.

 

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. MLP and Parent each
acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes the transactions
consummated pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an "assets-over"
partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations Sections
1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby MLP will be the
terminating partnership and Parent will be the resulting partnership. As a
result, the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the
assets of MLP to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Series
A Unit Consideration, the cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Units and
the assumption of liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, the Cash
Consideration and any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Units shall
be treated as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures described
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). To the

 



9  extent the Cash Consideration and any cash received in lieu of fractional
Parent Units exceeds the amount that can be so treated, such excess cash will
be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale transaction described in Section
707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a " _Disguised Sale_ "). Each of MLP and Parent
agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance
with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on
any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an applicable
Governmental Authority.

Section 2.3  _Treatment of Phantom Units, Unit Options, Cash Units and Equity
Plans_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the MLP Managing GP
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any MLP Equity Plans)
will adopt resolutions, and MLP will take all other actions as may be
necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and each MLP Equity
Plan (including, the award agreements in respect of awards granted
thereunder) to give effect to this _Section 2.3_ to provide that:

(a) _Treatment of Phantom Units_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the terms of a particular award or as provided in _Section 5.2(a)(viii)(E)_
of the MLP Disclosure Schedule, each award of Phantom Units that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to relate to or represent a right to receive Common Units and
shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive (i)
the Cash Consideration, (ii) an award of phantom units relating to Parent
Units (a " _Converted Parent Phantom Unit Award_ ") on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the corresponding award of Phantom Units,
except that the number of Parent Units covered by each such Converted Parent
Phantom Unit Award shall be equal to the number of Common Units subject to the
corresponding award of Phantom Units multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole unit, and (iii) in respect of the fractional
phantom unit not received as a result of the rounding described in _clause
(ii)_ above, a cash payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to the
applicable fractional amount multiplied by the closing price of a Parent Unit
on the NYSE on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, any then-accumulated distribution equivalent amounts
payable pursuant to distribution equivalent rights with respect to each
Phantom Unit will carry over and be paid to the holder upon, and subject to,
the vesting of the Converted Parent Phantom Unit that corresponds to the
Phantom Unit to which such distribution equivalent amounts related.

 

(b) _Treatment of Unit Options_. Each Unit Option that is outstanding and "in-
the-money" on the Closing Date ( _i.e._ , having a per unit exercise price
greater than the closing price of a Common Unit on the NYSE on the last
trading day prior to the Closing Date) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not vested) shall be deemed to have been exercised on a net-
issuance ( _i.e._ , cashless) basis immediately prior to the Effective Time
and each net issued Common Unit deemed to have been issued will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section
2.1(a)(i)_ on the terms generally applicable to issued and outstanding Common
Units, except as provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_ (such consideration the "
_Option Consideration_ "). Unless a recipient of Option Consideration shall
have remitted to Parent GP or its applicable Affiliate the amount required to
be withheld with respect to the

 



10  payment of the Option Consideration under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law, the Option Consideration to be received by
such holder shall be reduced by the amount required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to such payment. Such reduction shall come first from
the Cash Consideration portion of the Option Consideration payable to the
holder of the Unit Option (and from the cash payment, if any, described in
the last sentence of this _Section 2.3(b)_), and if such amount is
insufficient to satisfy the amount required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the payment of the Option Consideration, then the Unit
Consideration portion of the Option Consideration shall be reduced by a
number of Parent Units equal to (i) the remaining amount required to be
deducted and withheld, divided by (ii) the closing price of one Parent Unit on
the NYSE on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the
foregoing but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any Cash Consideration portion of the Option Consideration will be
remitted to and paid through the ordinary payroll processes of the MLP GP or
its successor or applicable Affiliate as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date. Each outstanding Unit Option that is not "in-the-money" as of the
Closing Date shall be mandatorily surrendered to the MLP and canceled and
terminated at the Effective Time for no consideration. In the event that the
deemed exercise described in this _Section 2.3(b)_ would result in the holder
of the Unit Option being deemed to hold a fractional Common Unit, that holder
shall not receive such fractional unit and shall instead receive cash equal to
the value of such fractional unit based on the closing price of a Common Unit
on the NYSE on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date, less
applicable withholdings.

(c) _Treatment of Cash Units_. Each award of Cash Units that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to relate to or represent a right to receive an amount of cash based on the
fair market value of the Common Units and shall be converted, at the Effective
Time, into the right to receive (i) the Cash Consideration, (ii) an award of
restricted cash units relating to Parent Units (a " _Converted Parent Cash
Unit Award_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
corresponding award of Cash Units, except that the number of notional units
that upon vesting entitles the holder to receive an amount of cash equal to
the fair market value of a Parent Unit shall be equal to the number of
notional Common Units related to the corresponding award of Cash Units
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole unit, and
(iii) in respect of the fractional restricted cash unit not received as a
result of the rounding described in _clause (ii)_ above, a cash payment, less
applicable withholdings, equal to the applicable fractional amount multiplied
by the closing price of a Parent Unit on the NYSE on the last trading day
prior to the Closing Date. MLP Managing GP will cause the compensation
committee of its board of directors to adopt prior to the Effective Time an
amendment to the Regency Energy Partners LP Long-Term Incentive Cash
Restricted Unit Plan to permit the treatment of Cash Units as provided herein.

(d) _Assumption of MLP Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume the obligations of MLP under the MLP Equity Plans and shall assume such
plans for purposes of employing such plans to make grants of equity based
awards on Parent Units following the Closing.

 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding Common Units, Class F Units,

 



11  Series A Units or Parent Units shall have been changed into a different
number of units or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record
date of any unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar
transaction, each of the Cash Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and the Series
A Unit Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of such unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar
transaction and to provide the holders of Common Units, Class F Units
and Series A Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger, the GP Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 2.6 _Effect of the GP Merger_. By virtue of the GP Merger and without
any action on the part of MLP GP, Parent GP or their respective partners: (i)
the general partner interest and limited partner interest of MLP GP issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the GP Merger Effective Time shall be
canceled and cease to exist, and no former partner of MLP GP, in its capacity
as such, shall have any partnership or other interest in the surviving limited
partnership of the GP Merger, (ii) the general partner interest and limited
partner interest of Parent GP issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
GP Merger Effective Time shall not be affected and shall remain issued and
outstanding as the partnership interests of the surviving limited partnership
in the GP Merger, and (iii) the Parent Managing GP and ETE shall continue as
the sole general partner and limited partner, respectively, of Parent GP
following the GP Merger Effective Time. At the Effective Time, (x) the
certificate of limited partnership of Parent GP as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain unchanged and shall be the certificate of
limited partnership of the surviving limited partnership in the GP Merger from
and after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as provided
therein or by Law and (y) the agreement of limited partnership of Parent GP
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain unchanged
and shall be the agreement of limited partnership of the surviving limited
partnership in the GP Merger from and after the Effective Time,
and thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by Law.

Section 3.5 _MLP SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) MLP and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2012
(collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on
Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _MLP SEC Documents_ ").
The MLP SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
the MLP SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other MLP SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
applicable to such MLP SEC Documents, and none of the MLP SEC Documents as of
such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with
respect to the MLP SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of MLP, none of the MLP SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of MLP included in the MLP SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment)

 



16  comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto) applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of MLP and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows
and changes in partners equity for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments,
none of which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to MLP and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) MLP has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to MLP, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by MLP in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to MLPs principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by MLP in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. MLPs
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to MLPs auditors and the
audit committee of the MLP Managing GP Board (x) all significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect
MLPs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for MLPs auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls
and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in MLPs internal controls. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of MLP have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the MLP SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete and correct when made. The management of MLP has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of MLPs internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of MLP, as of the date of
this Agreement there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of MLP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 (the " _Balance Sheet
Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the MLP SEC Documents filed
by MLP and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether

 



17  or not accrued or contingent), that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of MLP prepared in accordance
with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among MLP and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, MLP in MLPs published financial statements or any MLP SEC
Documents.

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, MLP and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither MLP
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in  _Section
5.2(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , _(ix)_ , _(xiv)_ or _(xv)_
(but, with respect to _(vii)_ , disregarding the proviso to _Section
5.2(a)(vii)(A)(1)_, and with respect to _(xv)_ , only to the extent
applicable to the other clauses designated in this _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_)
that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time without the prior written consent of Parent, would violate such
provisions.

Section 3.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of MLP, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to MLP or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of MLP, threatened) against MLP or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at law or in
equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments
or decrees of any Governmental Authority against MLP or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) MLP and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2012 and
their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have been,
in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial law, statute,
tariff, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction,
stipulation, determination, award or decree or agency requirement of or
undertaking to any Governmental Authority, including common law (collectively,
" _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-compliance, default
or violation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material
Adverse Effect.

 



18 (b) MLP and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for MLP and its Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the " _MLP Permits_ "), except where the failure
to have any of the MLP Permits would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. All MLP Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the MLP Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of MLP, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse
Effect. MLP and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2012 have not
been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any MLP Permit, except
where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of MLP, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of MLP or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any MLP Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any MLP Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 3.8(a)_, MLP, each of its
Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of MLP, each joint venture partner, joint
interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of the foregoing
(in their respective capacities as such), (i) has not violated the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption
Laws that are applicable to MLP or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has not, to the
Knowledge of MLP, been given written notice by any Governmental Authority of
any facts which, if true, would constitute a violation of the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other U.S. or foreign anti-corruption
Laws by any such person; and (iii) to the Knowledge of MLP, is not being (and
has not been) investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in each case
of the foregoing  _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.9 _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent set forth in  _Section 4.9_, none
of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of
MLP specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the

connection with the issuance of Parent Units in connection with the Merger (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Registration Statement_ ")
will, at the time the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, (b) the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is
first mailed to MLP Unitholders and Parent Unitholders, and at the time of the
MLP Unitholders Meeting and Parent Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a

 



19  material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (c) the Schedule
13E-3 will, at the time the Schedule 13E-3, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material

Section 4.5 _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2012 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). The Parent SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the
case of the Parent SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their
respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC Documents),
or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable
to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such
respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Parent SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



31 (c) Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
Parents auditors and the audit and risk committee of the Parent Managing GP
Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including
the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or

 



32  among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),
where the purpose of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent in Parents
published financial statements or any Parent SEC Documents.

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Parent, would violate
such provisions.

pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental

at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no

not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any of the Parent Permits would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of Parent Permits is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where such
suspension or cancellation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and
since December 31, 2012 have not been, in violation or breach of, or default
under, any Parent Permit, except where such

 



33  violation, breach or default would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no event or condition has occurred or exists
which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit
under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any Parent Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable
Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend any Parent
Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both), except

Effect.

Adverse Effect. Except for such non-compliance which would not have,

of employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment,

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by MLP; Etc._

 

(a) MLP shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best

employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an MLP Alternative
Proposal, request the return or destruction of all confidential information
previously provided to such parties by or on behalf of MLP or its Subsidiaries
and immediately prohibit any access by any Person (other than Parent and its
Representatives) to any physical or electronic data room relating to a
possible MLP Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3_,
(x) MLP shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing confidential information) or knowingly induce or take any other
action intended to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that constitute the
submission of an MLP Alternative Proposal, (ii) grant approval to any Person
under _clause (iii)_ of the provision in the definition of "Outstanding" in
the MLP Partnership Agreement, (iii) except for a confidentiality agreement
permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_, enter into any confidentiality

Proposal (an " _MLP Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the MLP Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the
approval or adoption of, or publicly approve or adopt, or propose to publicly
recommend, approve or adopt, any MLP Alternative Proposal and (y) within five
business days of receipt of a written request of Parent following the receipt
by MLP of any MLP Alternative Proposal, MLP shall publicly reconfirm the MLP
Board Recommendation; _provided_ , that, in the event that Parent requests
such public reconfirmation of the MLP Board Recommendation, then MLP may not
unreasonably withhold, delay (beyond the five business day period)
or condition the public reconfirmation of the MLP Board Recommendation and
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not be permitted to make such
request on more than one occasion in respect of each MLP Alternative Proposal
and each material modification to an MLP Alternative Proposal, if any (the
taking of any action described in _clause (x)(iv)_ or the failure to take the
action described in _clause (y)_ being referred to as an " _MLP Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by MLPs Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by MLP
unless such violation is committed without the Knowledge of MLP and MLP uses
its reasonable best efforts to promptly cure such violation once MLP is made
aware of such violation.

 



45 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,

Proposal that the MLP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the MLP
Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide, (ii) the MLP Managing GP Board
(upon the recommendation of the MLP Conflicts Committee), after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good
faith that (A) such MLP Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to or result in an MLP Superior Proposal and (B) failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under the MLP
Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and (iii) such MLP Alternative
Proposal did not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.3_, then
MLP may, subject to _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below, (A) furnish information,
including confidential information, with respect to MLP and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making such MLP Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such MLP Alternative Proposal;
_provided_ that (x) MLP will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless MLP has, or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with
such Person with confidentiality provisions that are not less restrictive to
such Person than the provisions of the Parent Confidentiality Agreement are
to Parent and (y) MLP will provide to Parent non-public information about MLP
or its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or making
available such non-public information to such other Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of MLP set forth in this  _Section
5.3_, MLP shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other
contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, MLP in respect
of any MLP Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the
nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies
of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to
such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep
Parent reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the status
and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and MLP shall
promptly provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials
received by MLP or that MLP has delivered to any third party making an MLP
Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the MLP Unitholder Approval, the MLP Managing GP Board and the
MLP Conflicts Committee may effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an MLP Alternative Proposal or an MLP Changed Circumstance if the
MLP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the MLP Conflicts
Committee), after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its duties under the MLP Partnership Agreement or
applicable Law and:

(i) if the MLP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the MLP Conflicts
Committee) intends to effect such MLP Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an MLP Alternative Proposal:

(A) such MLP Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

 



46 (B) the MLP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the MLP
Conflicts Committee) has determined, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such MLP Alternative Proposal
constitutes an MLP Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments offered by Parent pursuant to  _clause (E)_ below;

(C) MLP has provided prior written notice to Parent in accordance with
_Section 8.9_ (the " _MLP Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the MLP Managing
GP Boards intention to effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change, and such
MLP Superior Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the Person making
such MLP Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such MLP
Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal or offers
(including proposed agreements) received by MLP in connection with such MLP
Alternative Proposal;

 

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the MLP
Superior Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_ and
ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _MLP Superior Proposal Notice
Period_ "), MLP shall (1) negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
MLP Managing GP Board not to effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(2) keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in
the material terms and conditions of such MLP Alternative Proposal or other
change in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
material revisions to such MLP Alternative Proposal (it being agreed that any
change in the purchase price in such MLP Alternative Proposal shall be deemed
a material revision) shall require delivery of a subsequent MLP Superior
Proposal Notice and a subsequent MLP Superior Proposal Notice Period in
respect of such revised MLP Alternative Proposal, except that such subsequent
MLP Superior Proposal Notice Period shall expire upon the later of (x) the end
of the initial MLP Superior Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central
time on the date that is the third calendar day following the date of the
delivery of such subsequent MLP Superior Proposal Notice; and

(E) the MLP Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the
end of the MLP Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good
faith that (i) such MLP Alternative Proposal continues to constitute an MLP
Superior Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect and (ii)
failure to

 



47  effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
duties under the MLP Partnership Agreement or applicable Law even if such
revisions were to be given effect; or

 

(ii) if the MLP Managing GP Board intends to effect such MLP Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an MLP Changed Circumstance:

(A) MLP has provided prior written notice to Parent in accordance with
_Section 8.9_ (the " _MLP Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the MLP
Managing GP Boards intention to effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change,
and such MLP Recommendation Change Notice has specified the details of such
MLP Changed Circumstance and the reasons for the MLP Adverse Recommendation
Change;

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the MLP
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_
and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _MLP Recommendation Change Notice
Period_ "), MLP shall (i) negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
MLP Managing GP Board not to effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(ii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any change in circumstances related
thereto; and

(C) the MLP Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the
end of the MLP Adverse Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have
determined (upon the recommendation of the MLP Conflicts Committee) in good
faith that the failure to effect an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its duties under the MLP Partnership Agreement or applicable
Law even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent MLP or the MLP Managing
GP Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an MLP Alternative Proposal if
the MLP Managing GP Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that any MLP Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section
5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes MLPs
receipt of an MLP Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto shall not be deemed an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation by Parent; Etc._

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to cause Parents and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause

 



48  to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to a Parent Alternative Proposal, request the return
or destruction of all confidential information previously provided to such
parties by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit
any access by any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) to any
physical or electronic data room relating to a possible Parent Alternative
Proposal. Except as permitted by this _Section 5.4_, (x) Parent shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
confidential information) or knowingly induce or take any other action
intended to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that constitute the
submission of a Parent Alternative Proposal, (ii) except for a
confidentiality agreement permitted pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_, enter into
any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement
in principle, unit purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or unit
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to a
Parent Alternative Proposal (a " _Parent Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iii)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to MLP, the Parent Board Recommendation or
publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly approve or adopt,
or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any Parent Alternative
Proposal and (y) within five business days of receipt of a written request of
MLP following the receipt by Parent of any Parent Alternative Proposal, Parent
shall publicly reconfirm the Parent Board Recommendation; _provided_  that,
in the event that MLP requests such public reconfirmation of the Parent Board
Recommendation, then Parent may not unreasonably withhold, delay (beyond the
five business day period) or condition the public reconfirmation of the Parent
Board Recommendation and _provided_ , _further_ that MLP shall not be
permitted to make such request on more than one occasion in respect of each
Parent Alternative Proposal and each material modification to a Parent
Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking of any action described in _clause
(x)(iii)_ or the failure to take the action described in _clause (y)_ being
referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by Parents Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be
a breach of this _Section 5.4_ by Parent unless such violation is committed
without the Knowledge of Parent and Parent uses its reasonable best efforts
to promptly cure such violation once Parent is made aware of such violation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Parent Unitholder Approval, (i) Parent has received a written Parent
Alternative Proposal that the Parent Managing GP Board (upon the
recommendation of the Parent Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide, (ii)
the Parent Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the Parent Conflicts
Committee), after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that (A) such Parent Alternative Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Parent
Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its duties under the Parent Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and
(iii) such Parent Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach
of this _Section 5.4_, then Parent may, subject to _clauses (x)_  and _(y)_
below, (A) furnish information, including confidential information, with
respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Parent
Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Parent Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x) Parent will
not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person unless Parent has, or first
enters into, 

 



49  a confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions
that are not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the Parent
Confidentiality Agreement are to MLP and (y) Parent will provide to MLP non-
public information about Parent or its Subsidiaries that was not previously
provided or made available to MLP prior to or substantially concurrently with
providing or making available such non-public information to such other
Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section
5.4_, Parent shall promptly advise MLP, orally and in writing, and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
Parent in respect of any Parent Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such
notice to MLP, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep MLP reasonably informed of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests (and Parent shall promptly provide MLP with copies of any additional
written materials received by Parent or that Parent has delivered to any
third party making a Parent Alternative Proposal that relate to such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the Parent Unitholder Approval, the Parent Managing GP Board and
the Parent Conflicts Committee may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Parent Alternative Proposal or a Parent Changed
Circumstance if the Parent Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the
Parent Conflicts Committee), after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under the Parent
Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and:

(i) if the Parent Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the Parent
Conflicts Committee) intends to effect such Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Parent Alternative Proposal:

(A) such Parent Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not
been withdrawn or abandoned;

(B) the Parent Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the Parent
Conflicts Committee) has determined, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Parent Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments offered by MLP pursuant to _clause (E)_ below;

(C) Parent has provided prior written notice to MLP in accordance with
_Section 8.9_ (the " _Parent Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the Parent
Managing GP Boards intention to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, and such Parent Superior Proposal Notice has specified the identity
of the Person

 



50  making such Parent Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions
of such Parent Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written
proposal or offers (including proposed agreements) received by Parent in
connection with such Parent Alternative Proposal;

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the Parent
Superior Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_ and
ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _Parent Superior Proposal Notice
Period_ "), Parent shall (1) negotiate with MLP in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
Parent Managing GP Board not to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change; and (2) keep MLP reasonably informed with respect to the status and
changes in the material terms and conditions of such Parent Alternative
Proposal or other change in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any material revisions to such Parent Alternative Proposal
(it being agreed that any change in the purchase price in such Parent
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed a material revision) shall require
delivery of a subsequent Parent Superior Proposal Notice and a subsequent
Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such revised Parent
Alternative Proposal, except that such subsequent Parent Superior Proposal
Notice Period shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the initial
Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central time on the
date that is the third calendar day following the date of the delivery of such
subsequent Parent Superior Proposal Notice; and

 

(E) the Parent Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by MLP and, at the end
of the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good
faith that (i) such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Parent
Superior Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect and (ii)
failure to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its duties under the Parent Partnership Agreement or applicable Law even
if such revisions were to be given effect; or

 

(ii) if the Parent Managing GP Board intends to effect such Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Changed Circumstance:

(A) Parent has provided prior written notice to MLP in accordance with
_Section 8.9_ (the " _Parent Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the Parent
Managing GP Boards intention to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, and such Parent Recommendation Change Notice has specified the details
of such Parent Changed Circumstance and the reasons for the Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change;

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the Parent
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_
and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day

 



51  following the date of such delivery (the " _Parent Recommendation Change
Notice Period_ "), Parent shall (i) negotiate with MLP in good faith to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the Parent Managing GP Board not to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change; and (ii) keep MLP reasonably informed of any change in
circumstances related thereto; and

 

(C) the Parent Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by MLP and, at the end
of the Parent Adverse Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have
determined (upon the recommendation of the Parent Conflicts Committee) in good
faith that the failure to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with its duties under the Parent Partnership Agreement or
applicable Law even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the Parent
Managing GP Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a Parent Alternative
Proposal if the Parent Managing GP Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of applicable Law;
_provided_ that any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
accordance with  _Section 5.4(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public
statement that describes Parents receipt of a Parent Alternative Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.5(d)_), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the MLP Entities,
on the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including preparing
and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain
promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seek
to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties.

 



52 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing (if required) of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable and in any event within 15 business days after the date of
this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the parties
hereto) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.5_ necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date); and (ii) MLP and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action necessary to ensure that such transaction may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transaction.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by providing the other parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other party) any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Authority and any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other
party to review in advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with
the other party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Parent shall
have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy
for obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining such clearances, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall consult
in advance with MLP and in good faith take MLPs views into account regarding
the overall strategy. Subject to _Section 5.7(b)_, the parties shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

 



53 (d) Parent and MLP (including by causing their respective Subsidiaries) agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any objections that a
Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
and in any event no later than the Outside Date, and including offering,
accepting and agreeing to (A) dispose or hold separate any part of MLPs,
Parents or their respective Subsidiaries businesses, operations or assets
(or a combination thereof), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of
business, and/or (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, MLP or
any of their respective Subsidiaries may carry on business in any part of the
world. MLP shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
disposal, hold separate, or other restriction related to its or its
Subsidiaries businesses, operations or assets.

 

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and MLP. Thereafter, neither MLP nor Parent
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE or other
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue
or cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement
without prior consultation with the other party); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) MLP shall not be required by this _Section 5.6_ to consult with any
other party with respect to a public announcement in connection with the
receipt and existence of an MLP Alternative Proposal that the MLP Managing GP
Board (upon the recommendation of the MLP Conflicts Committee) believes is
bona fide and matters related thereto or an MLP Adverse Recommendation Change
but nothing in this _clause (a)_ shall limit any obligation of MLP under
_Section 5.3(d)_ to negotiate with Parent in good faith and (b) Parent shall
not be required by this _Section 5.6_ to consult with any other party with
respect to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence
of a Parent Alternative Proposal that the Parent Managing GP Board (upon the
recommendation of the Parent Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide and
matters related thereto or a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change but nothing
in this _clause (b)_ shall limit any obligation of Parent under _Section
5.4(d)_ to negotiate with MLP in good faith; _provided_ , _further_ , that
each party and their respective controlled affiliates may make statements
that are consistent with statements made in previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent or MLP in compliance with this
_Section 5.6_. 

Section 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic

 



54  form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other Representatives. Each party shall furnish promptly to the other party
(i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by
it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy
of any communication (including "comment letters") received by such party from
the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as the other party may reasonably request (including information
necessary to prepare the Proxy Statement). Except for disclosures
permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January
16, 2015, between Parent and MLP (as it may be amended from time to time, the
" _Parent Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party and its Representatives
shall hold information received from the other party pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Parent
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) This _Section 5.7_ shall not require either party to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys position in any
pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii)
if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other party
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
that, in the case of _clause (i)_ , the parties hereto shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by
entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so
(1) would not (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to
disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-
house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such
contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which
appropriately designated Representatives of the other party shall be provided
access to such information;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the party being
requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the other party that
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other party in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this _Section 5.7(b)_) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.7_
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

 



55 Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. MLP shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to MLP, of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to MLP or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article VI_ and (iv) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ ; _provided_ that, in
the case of _clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ , the failure to comply with this
_Section 5.8_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ , or give rise to any right to
terminate this Agreement under _Article VII_, if the underlying fact,
circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself give rise to such
failure or right.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.9_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of MLP, MLP GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such Person, in their
capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with MLP) serving at the request of or on behalf of
MLP, MLP GP or any of their respective Subsidiaries and together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall
mean any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that MLP, MLP GP
or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would be permitted to indemnify an
Indemnified Person, Parent and Parent GP agree to (i) indemnify and hold
harmless against any cost or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in connection with
any Proceeding, and provide advancement promptly, and in any event within 10
days after any written request, of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) honor the
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in
the MLP Charter Documents and

 



56  comparable governing instruments of MLP GP and any Subsidiary of MLP or MLP
GP immediately prior to the Effective Time and ensure that the organizational
documents of the Surviving Entity and Parent GP shall, for a period of six
years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors, officers and agents of MLP, MLP GP and their respective
Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the MLP Charter Documents and
comparable governing instruments of MLP GP (it being acknowledged and agreed
that the provisions of the Parent Charter Documents and comparable governing
instruments of MLP GP currently in effect are no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of such Persons
than are presently in the MLP Charter Documents and comparable governing
instruments of MLP GP). Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Person
pursuant to this _Section 5.9(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of
such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

(c) The Surviving Entity and Parent GP shall maintain in effect for six years
from the Effective Time MLPs and MLP GPs current directors and officers
liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that
the Surviving Entity or Parent GP may substitute therefor policies with
reputable carriers of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Entity or Parent GP be
required to expend pursuant to this _Section 5.9(c)_ more than an amount per
year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by MLP or MLP GP for such
insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity or Parent GP would
be required to expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity or
Parent GP shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance as is available
for the Maximum Amount. If MLP or MLP GP in its sole discretion elects, then,
in lieu of the obligations of Parent and Parent GP under this _Section
5.9(c)_, MLP or MLP GP may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail
policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy exceed six times the
Maximum Amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.9_ shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
organizational documents of MLP, MLP GP, MLP Managing GP, the Surviving
Entity, Parent GP, Parent Managing GP, the DRULPA or the DLLCA. The
provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six years and are expressly
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective
heirs and representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section
5.9_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If the Surviving Entity, Parent
GP or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in

delay by any MLP Entity or any Parent Entity in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,

assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of MLP, but no
such assignment shall relieve MLP of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this _Section 8.4_ shall be null and void.

Section 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become

parties and delivered to the other parties.

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,

Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.7_,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



70 Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either
party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each party further
agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 8.8_, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. The parties agree that in the event that
Parent receives the MLP Termination Fee, Parent may not seek any award of
specific performance under this _Section 8.8_, and in the event that MLP
receives the Parent Termination Fee, MLP may not seek any award of specific
performance under this _Section 8.8_.
