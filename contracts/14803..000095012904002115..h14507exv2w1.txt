14   ARTICLE II   THE OFFER   SECTION 2.01. The Offer.   (a) Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable, and in any
event no more than ten Business Days, after the date of this Agreement,
Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to,
commence, within the meaning of Rule l4d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer.
The obligation of Merger Subsidiary to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Subsidiary to, accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered shall be
subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex A
and to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that Parent and
Merger Subsidiary may waive any of the conditions to the Offer (other than
the Minimum Condition, which may not be waived without the prior written
consent of the Company) and may make changes in the terms and conditions of
the Offer except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, no
change may be made to the form of consideration to be paid, no decrease in
the Offer Price or the number of Shares sought in the Offer may be made, no
change which imposes additional conditions to the Offer or modifies any of
the conditions set forth in Annex A in any manner adverse to the holders of
the Shares may be made and neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary may extend
the Offer, except in accordance with Section 2.01(c).   (b) On the date of
commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended and supplemented from
time to time, the "Schedule TO"), which shall comply in all material respects
with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws, and shall contain
the offer to purchase relating to the Offer and forms of the related letter
of transmittal and other appropriate documents (which documents, as amended
or supplemented from time to time, are referred to herein collectively as the
"Offer Documents"). The Parent and the Merger Subsidiary further agree to
disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. In conducting the Offer, the
Parent and the Merger Subsidiary shall comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other applicable laws necessary to
be complied with in connection with the Offer. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Subsidiary all information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company\'s stockholders that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated
by this Section 2.01. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their
filing with the SEC. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to provide
the Company, and to consult with the Company and its counsel regarding, any
comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether written or
oral) with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and
any responses thereto. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the     15    Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by law.  
(c) The initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer shall be 20 Business
Days after the date of its commencement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall have the right to extend the Offer (i)
from time to time if, at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any
of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A shall not have been
satisfied or waived, until such conditions are satisfied or waived; provided
that if any of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied or waived on any
scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall extend the Offer, if such condition or conditions could
reasonably be expected to be satisfied prior to ten Business Days following
the initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer; provided further that if
the conditions set forth in clauses (x) or (y) of the first sentence of Annex
A hereto are not satisfied or waived or the condition set forth in clause (z)
of Annex A is not satisfied or waived as a result of the occurrence of any of
the events described in subparagraphs (b) or (g) thereon on any scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall extend the
Offer at the request of the Company (but in no event shall Parent and Merger
Subsidiary be obligated to extend expiration of the Offer pursuant to this
clause (i) beyond August 15, 2004), (ii) for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable law, (iii) on
one or more occasions (all such occasions aggregating not more than ten
Business Days) beyond the latest expiration that would otherwise be permitted
under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, if, on such expiration date, all
of the conditions to Merger Subsidiary\'s obligations to accept for payment
Shares are satisfied or waived, but the number of Shares tendered (and not
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer, together with Shares then owned by Parent,
represents less than 90% of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis;
provided, however, that Parent\'s decision to extend the Offer in the case of
this clause (iii) shall constitute a waiver of the conditions set forth in
clauses (d) and (f) on Annex A and of its right to terminate the Agreement
under Sections 8.01(b), (d), (j) or (k), (iv) on up to two occasions (for a
period not to exceed ten Business Days on each occasion) if an Adverse Market
Change shall have occurred and be continuing on the initial or any extended
expiration date of the Offer, and (v) for one or more subsequent offering
periods of up to an additional 20 Business Days in the
aggregate (collectively, the "Subsequent Period") pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of
the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall also have the right to extend the Offer in accordance with Section
8.01(f).   (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to, accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as possible after the expiration
thereof; provided that Merger Subsidiary shall immediately accept and
promptly pay for all Shares as they are tendered during any Subsequent
Period. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Subsidiary on
a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger
Subsidiary becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.    
16     (e) The Offer Price may be increased by the Parent without
the consent of the Company, in which case the Offer shall be extended,
without the consent of the Company, as required by applicable law.  
SECTION 2.02. Company Actions.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors
of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted resolutions
approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (iii) resolved to

the provisions of Section 6.03, (iv) acknowledged that such approval is
effective for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL, (v) resolved to elect, to
the extent permitted by law, not to be subject to any "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of
anti-takeover laws and regulations of any jurisdiction that may purport to
be applicable to this Agreement and (vi) take all necessary steps to render
Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger, Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company further
represents that JPMorgan has delivered to the Board of Directors of the
Company an opinion to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the
consideration to be received by the holders of Shares (other than Parent and
Merger Subsidiary) in the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company described in the first sentence of this Section 2.02(a), subject to
the Company\'s rights to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.03 and represents that it has
obtained all necessary consents to permit the inclusion of the fairness
opinion of JPMorgan in the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement. The
Company hereby represents and warrants that it has been advised that each of
its directors and executive officers intends to tender pursuant to the Offer
any and all Shares they own beneficially or of record.   (b) The Company
shall file with the SEC on the date of commencement of the Offer a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended and
supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.03, the recommendation of the
Company\'s Board of Directors referred to above, and shall disseminate
the Schedule 14D-9 to stockholders of the Company as required by Rule
14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. To the extent practicable, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in mailing or
otherwise disseminating the Schedule 14D-9 with the appropriate Offer
Documents to the Company\'s stockholders. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable    
17    federal securities laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the
proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its
counsel (who shall provide any comments thereon as soon as practicable). The
Company agrees to provide Parent, and to consult with Parent and its counsel
regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff
(whether written or oral) with respect to the Schedule 14D-promptly after
receipt thereof and any responses thereto. Each of the Company, the Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by applicable
laws.   (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
promptly furnish Parent with (or cause Parent to be furnished with) mailing

containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of
a recent date, and shall furnish Parent with such information and assistance

the stockholders of the Company. Subject to the requirements of applicable
law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to,
hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels, listings
and files, use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated, deliver to the Company all

to applicable law and to the extent permitted by the NYSE, promptly upon the
acceptance for payment of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Merger
Subsidiary representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to
the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors
(giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this
Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned
by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (including Shares accepted for

all actions necessary to cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed
to the Company\'s Board of Directors, including increasing the size of the
Board of Directors and/or securing the resignations of incumbent directors
(including, if necessary, to ensure that a sufficient number of independent
directors are serving on the Board of Directors of the Company in order to
satisfy the NYSE listing requirements). Subject to applicable law and to the
extent permitted by the NYSE, the Company shall cause individuals designated

Directors of the Company (after giving effect to this Section 2.03(a)) to be

Board of     18    Directors and each committee thereof of each
Subsidiary of the Company. The Company\'s obligations to appoint designees to
its Board of Directors shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of

its stockholders all necessary information to comply therewith. Parent will
supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, all information with
respect to itself and its officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act.   (b) Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 2.03(a), following the election or appointment of
Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Board
of Directors to have at least two directors who are directors on the date
hereof and who are not employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates,
stockholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Independent Directors"); provided that if any Independent Directors cease to
be directors for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Directors
(or Independent Director, if there is only one remaining) shall be entitled
to designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate, stockholder
or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and
such Person(s) shall be deemed to be Independent Director(s) for purposes of
this Agreement; provided that the remaining Independent Directors shall fill
such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten Business
Days, and further provided that if no such Independent Director is appointed
in such time period, Parent shall designate such Independent Director(s),
provided further that if no Independent Director then remains, the other
directors shall designate two Persons who shall not be Affiliates,
stockholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such
vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. In all cases, the selection of any
Independent Directors who are not directors on the date hereof shall be
subject to the approval of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a
majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to authorize
(and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of
Directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize)
any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this
Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors, any extension of time
for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary and any enforcement of or any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any
action to seek to enforce any obligations of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
under this Agreement or any other action by the Company\'s Board of Directors
under or in connection with this Agreement. The Independent Directors shall
have full power solely with respect to the matters set forth in the previous
sentence to be approved by the Independent Directors and in connection
herewith the Independent Directors     19    shall be authorized, on
behalf of and at the expense of the Company, to retain one law firm and other
advisors.   ARTICLE III   MERGER; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   SECTION

Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the
Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver
all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts
necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation
and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the
Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.   SECTION 3.06.
Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) each Share held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company and each issued and outstanding Share owned by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall be
cancelled automatically and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment
or consideration shall be made with respect thereto;   (b) each issued and
outstanding Share other than (i) Shares referred to in Section 3.06(a) and
(ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest; and     21     (c) each share of
capital stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 3.07. Surrender
and Payment.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
to act as disbursing agent (the "Disbursing Agent") for the payment of
Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing the Shares.
Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary will enter into a disbursing
agent agreement with the Disbursing Agent, and Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to deposit with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to make the payments pursuant to Section 3.06(b) to holders of
Shares (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund")
prior to the time such payments are to be made by the Disbursing Agent. For
purposes of determining the amount to be so deposited, Merger Subsidiary
shall assume that no stockholder of the Company will perfect any right to
appraisal of his, her or its Shares. The Disbursing Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Merger Subsidiary; provided that such
investments shall be (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, or
(iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation; provided further that no
loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares
pursuant to Section 3.06(b). Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.06(b) shall be promptly paid to
Parent. Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to,
promptly replenish the Exchange Fund to the extent of any investment
losses.   (b) Merger Subsidiary shall instruct the Disbursing Agent to mail
promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event no later than the
fifth Business Day thereafter, to each person who was a record holder as of
the Effective Time of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the
"Certificates"), and whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.06(b), a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as are reasonable and customary in transactions such as
the Merger) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation, together
with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may
be reasonably required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of that      22    Certificate, less
any required withholding of Taxes, and such Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates.   (c) If payment is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and that the person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  
(d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.07,
each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent, Shares held by
the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes, from and
after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration.   (e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no registration of transfers of Shares which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, such Certificates shall be cancelled and
exchanged for cash as provided in this Article III. At the close of
business on the day of the Effective Time the stock ledger of the Company
shall be closed.   (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Disbursing Agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. At any
time more than nine months after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent
shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made
available to the Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in exchange for
Certificates (including all interest and other income received by the
Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter, holders of
Certificates shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the
terms of this Agreement, abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws)
as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that
may be payable, without interest, upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when
such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any    
23    holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such Certificate of Shares to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.   SECTION 3.08. Company
Stock Options.   (a) The Company represents and warrants that each option
to acquire Shares granted under any Company Option Plan (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is not fully vested and exercisable and that is
outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the consummation of the
Offer (the "Trigger Event") shall automatically become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Trigger Event pursuant to the terms of
the Company Option Plans without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the holder of any such Company Stock Option. On
the Acceptance Date, each outstanding Company Stock Option, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the holder of any such
Company Stock Option, shall be cancelled and shall solely represent the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (a) the Option
Consideration multiplied by (b) the aggregate number of Shares into which the
applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Trigger Event. The Company covenants and agrees that on or prior to the
Acceptance Date it shall take all requisite action, if any, necessary to
effect the preceding sentence. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
3.08(a) to the holder of any Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any
income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax laws and (iii) any other applicable
laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be
treated as having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option for
all purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall make the payments
in respect of the Company Stock Options as promptly as practicable following
the cancellation of such Company Stock Options as contemplated by this
Section 3.08(a) by checks payable to the holders of such Company Stock
Options unless the aggregate amount payable to a particular individual
exceeds $500,000, in which event payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediate available funds upon receipt by the Company of written payment
instructions from the relevant option holder. Upon written notice from the
Company, Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay to the Company an amount
in cash sufficient to fund the Company\'s payment obligation under this
Section 3.08(a) as such amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such
written notice). The Company shall take all requisite action so that,
immediately following the payments described in this Section 3.08(a), each
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and, after all outstanding Company
Stock Options have been cancelled, all Company Option Plans shall be
terminated.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Parent,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company (if any) for purposes of Section 16 under the
Exchange Act ("Section 16") of Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to
this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16.     24     SECTION 3.09. Dissenting Shares.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are
held by any record holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall
become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL; provided, however,
that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or
shall have withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration without interest. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 3.09, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of
such stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation
shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with respect to
holders of Dissenting Shares.   (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands
received by the Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct and
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands.  
SECTION 3.10. Adjustments. If during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall
occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or
any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer
Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.  
SECTION 3.11. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Disbursing
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Article such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.   SECTION 3.12. Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person     
25    claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will pay, in exchange for such affidavit
claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article.   ARTICLE IV

Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its

creditors\' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.   (b) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and

a material effect on the ongoing value, business or operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   SECTION 4.04. Non-Contravention.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and

with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any material law

other action by any Person under, constitute a default under or give rise to
a right of termination, cancellation, change any material right or obligation
or give rise to a right of acceleration of any right or obligation or to the
loss of any benefit or material adverse modification of the effect (including
an increase in the price paid by, or cost to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) of, or under any provision of any agreement or other instrument
to which the Company is a party or that is binding upon the Company or any of

respect to clauses (iii) and (iv) as set forth in Section 4.04 of the Company

Company and their jurisdictions of organization are set forth in Section 4.06
of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is

on Form 10-K, (ii) all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, (iii) all proxy
statements relating to meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special),
(iv) all Current Reports on Form 8-K and (v) all other reports, schedules,

amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
the Company Reports (including any financial statements or schedules included
or incorporated by reference therein) (i) complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. To
the Company\'s Knowledge, the Company is not required to file any forms,
reports, schedules, statements or other documents with any foreign
Governmental Entity that performs a similar function to that of the SEC or
any securities exchange or quotation service other than the NYSE.
No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to periodic    
30    reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act or is
otherwise required to file documents with the SEC or any securities exchange
or quotation service or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any foreign
Governmental Entity that performs a similar function to that of the SEC.  
(a) The Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the Company\'s Board of
Directors (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls that could adversely affect the Company\'s ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified
for the Company\'s auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s internal controls.
The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared; and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely fashion alerting the
Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in the Company\'s periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.   SECTION 4.08. Financial
Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.   (a) The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries included or incorporated by
reference in the Company Reports, including reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q,
as of their respective dates, and giving effect to any amendments or
supplements thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, comply as to
form in all material respects with the then applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders\' equity

Agreement. All nonpublic information provided to, or obtained by, Parent in

Material" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement previously executed
by or on behalf of Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement");

Parent or Merger Subsidiary from including, after prior consultation with the
Company or its Representatives, in the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase,
the other Tender Offer Documents or the Proxy Statement, any information that
is required by law to be disclosed therein in connection with the purchase of

are reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage
in discussions or negotiations with, furnish or disclose any information or
data relating to     53    the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,

discussions, negotiations or other activity with any Person being conducted
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal on the date hereof. The Company
shall promptly inform its Representatives who have been engaged or
are otherwise providing assistance in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement of the Company\'s obligations under this
Section 6.03. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any
breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.03, including any
failure of such Representatives to comply with any instructions referred to
above, by any of such Representatives or any Affiliate of the Company shall
be deemed to be a breach by the Company of this Section 6.03.   (c) The

the Company reasonably believes is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with the identity of
such Person, a description of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal
or request and, if applicable, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request.   (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Date,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors
from:   (i) engaging in discussions or negotiations with, or  furnishing or
disclosing any information relating to, the Company or  any of its
Subsidiaries or giving access to the Company Assets or the  books and records
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any  Person who, after the date
hereof, makes a bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal not solicited after
the date hereof in violation  of the provisions herein set forth if (x) the
Board of Directors has  (A) acted in good faith and by a majority of the
members of its entire  Board of Directors, (B) determined, after consultation
with its  financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably
likely  to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) determined, after
consultation  with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to     
54     take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of
its  fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under 
applicable laws (in each case, taking into account any adjustments to  the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger  offered in
writing by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal),  (y) the Company
enters into a confidentiality agreement with such  Person provided that to
the extent such Confidentiality Agreement is on  terms and conditions
materially more favorable to such Person than  those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality  Agreement shall be deemed
amended to contain such materially more  favorable terms; and   (ii)
subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d)(i),  entering into a definitive
agreement providing for the implementation  of or approving, endorsing or
recommending an Acquisition Proposal, but  only so long as (A) the Board of
Directors, acting in good faith and by  a majority of the entire Board of
Directors, has (1) approved such  definitive agreement, (2) determined, after
consultation with its  financial advisor, that such bona fide written and
unsolicited  Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (3) 
determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the 
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach  of
its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under 
applicable laws and (B) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant  to,
and after complying with all of the provisions of, Section 8.01(f).   (e) If
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives
receives a request for information from a Person who has made an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal involving the Company and the Company
is permitted to provide such Person with information pursuant to this Section
6.03, the Company will provide to Parent a copy of the
confidentiality agreement with such Person promptly upon its execution and
provide to Parent a list of, and copies of, the information provided to such
Person promptly after its delivery to such Person and promptly provide Parent
with access to all information to which such Person was provided access, in
each case only to the extent not previously provided to Parent.   (f) The
Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) enter into any agreement in principle or understanding or
contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company terminates

of, Section 8.01(f).   (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted to disclose to the stockholders
of the Company a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal required by
Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw,
modify or amend the recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this
Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company at any time if, in each
case, it determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that     55    the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable laws.   SECTION 6.04. Notices of Certain Events;
Consultation.   (a) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any notice or other
communication of which the Company has Knowledge from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any

disclosed pursuant to Section 4.11 or which relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any fact or occurrence

of the Offer and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger
Subsidiary shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than

not     56    permit Merger Subsidiary to, take any action that would

the aggregate annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance
on the date of this Agreement, provided that if the annual premium for such
insurance shall exceed such 200% in any year, the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount; provided further that in the event Parent
shall, directly or indirectly, sell all or substantially all of the assets or
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, prior to such sale, Parent shall
either assume such obligation or cause a Subsidiary of Parent having a net
worth substantially equivalent to, or in excess of the net worth of, the

Waivers.   (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived prior to the Effective Time if, and only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent

(y) any term of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
or (z) any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or

affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors.   (b) No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.   SECTION 9.04. Fees and Expenses.   (a)
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.   (b)
The Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent, in accordance
with Section 9.04(d), the sum of (x) Parent\'s Expenses (up to a maximum
amount not to exceed $3.0 million) and (y) $80.0 million if:     
66     (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section  8.01(e) or
Section 8.01(f); or   (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section  8.01(b) and, with respect to this clause (ii) only, at the time of
such  termination (w) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, (x) a 
bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been previously announced or made  known
to the Company or an offer commenced and (y) prior to the one  year
anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (I)
consummates any Acquisition Proposal regardless of  whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition  Proposal referred to in clause
(x) or (II) enters into any agreement in  principle, arrangement,
understanding or contract providing for the  implementation of any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a capital  raising transaction by the
Company in the form of an underwritten  public offering) regardless of
whether or not such Acquisition Proposal  was the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (x) and shall  consummate (whether before or after such
one year anniversary) such  Acquisition Proposal.   (c) Any amounts payable
pursuant to Sections 9.04(b)(i) shall be payable as promptly as practicable
following termination of this Agreement (but no more than three Business
Days) and, if the Company is the party seeking to terminate this Agreement,
as a condition thereto. Any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii)
shall be payable promptly but in no event later than three Business Days
after the last of the specified events has occurred; provided that for the
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the last specified event
to occur in connection with any amount payable pursuant to Section 9.4(b)(ii)
shall be consummation of the applicable Acquisition Proposal.   (d) The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.04 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
promptly any amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.04, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee or expense reimbursement set forth in this
Section 9.04, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement on the
amounts so owed at the prime rate of Chase Manhattan Bank per annum in effect
from time to time during such period, plus 4%.   SECTION 9.05. Successors
and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer

Merger Subsidiary of their obligations hereunder in the event of a breach by
their transferee).      67     SECTION 9.06. GOVERNING LAW. THIS

constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
