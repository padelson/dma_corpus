credit.

 

 

(c) Escrow Deposit. At Closing, the parties will deliver (i) 1,818,182 Buyer
Units and (ii) $600,000 to the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Deposit"), which

adjusted, prior to being paid to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.2(a),
as follows:

 

 

(a) Indebtedness for Borrowed Money. The Cash Payment will be reduced by

(b) Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment. At least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, not including the Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer their written calculations of the Estimated Net

Net Working Capital). If the Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital is
less than the Target Net Working Capital, then the Cash Payment will
be reduced dollar-for-dollar by such difference. If the Estimated Effective
Time Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, then
the Cash Payment will be increased dollar-for-dollar by an amount equal to

Closing Date, not including the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer an estimate of all current assets and liabilities having

Exhibit E. The Cash Payment paid at Closing shall be increased or decreased,
as the case may be, by the net amount of such estimate.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-12-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Capital Expenditures. The Cash Payment paid at Closing shall
be increased by the amount of all Capital Expenditures described on
Schedule 2.3(d), or which have been approved in advance by Buyer and
are attributable to the Company, paid by or on behalf of Sellers or the
Company in the ordinary course through the Effective Time.

 

 

(e) Special Reduction in Cash Payment. Sellers and the Company shall settle,
terminate or unwind all natural gas, ethane and crude oil calls, puts, swaps
and other commodity or interest rate hedges of the Company between the date
hereof and Closing. The Cash Payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to
all net costs and expenses arising out of or related to settling, terminating
or unwinding all natural gas, ethane and crude oil calls, puts, swaps and
other commodity or interest rate hedges of the Company during the period
after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing Date. If the Sellers and
the Company fail to settle, terminate or unwind the commodity or interest
rate hedges, and Buyer chooses to waive its condition to closing provided in
Section 8.1(q), then the Cash Payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the net cost to settle, terminate or unwind the commodity or interest rate
hedges as of the Closing.

 

 

(f) Bonuses. The Cash Payment will be reduced by the aggregate amount of
transaction bonuses, change in control payments, incentive payments, "stay
bonuses," or similar payments payable to certain employees of the Company in
connection with this transaction or as provided in Section 6.5(j), as
reflected on Exhibit E, the amount and payment terms and conditions of which,
the identities of the payees, and the amount payable to each such payee, and
such other information as the Buyer may reasonably request, will be
communicated by the Company to the Buyer at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. The total amount paid to employees under this
Section 2.3(f) shall not exceed $900,000.

 

 

(g) Vacation Pay. The Cash Payment will be reduced by the aggregate
amount of vacation pay and paid time off payable to employees of the Company
under the Company's standard employment policies, which amounts shall be as
provided in the schedule submitted to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.5(g).

by an amount equal to the cost of the premium paid by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.8 to purchase run-off coverage under the Company's current Director
and Officer Insurance Policy for six years.

 

 

By way of example, Exhibit E is a representative calculation as of the
Balance Sheet Date of the Cash Payment as adjusted by each of the foregoing.

to the Cash Payment as of the Effective Time.

-13-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(a) Final Net Working Capital.

 

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within ninety (90) days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Sellers a Final Effective Time Balance Sheet and a calculation of the Final
Effective Time Net Working Capital using the same methodology set forth on
Exhibit E (the "Final Calculations").

 

 

(ii) The Sellers shall have the right to review and verify the Final
Effective Time Balance Sheet and the Final Calculations. Buyer shall provide
Sellers and their Representatives reasonable access to the records and
employees of the Company and shall cause the employees of the Company to
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Sellers in connection with
their review of such work papers and other documents and information relating
to the Final Calculations as the Sellers shall reasonably request and that
are available to the Buyer and the Company or their independent
public accountants. If, within forty-five (45) days after Sellers'
receipt of the Final Calculations, Sellers shall not have given written
notice to Buyer of objection thereto, then Sellers shall be deemed to have
accepted the Final Calculations, which shall then be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event that Sellers give written
notice of any objection to the Final Effective Time Balance Sheet or the
Final Calculations (an "Objection Notice") within such forty-five (45) day
period, then Sellers and Buyer will use all commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve the disputed matter(s) within the thirty (30) day period following
the delivery of such Objection Notice.

 

 

(iii) If, at the end of the thirty (30) day resolution period, the Parties
are unable to resolve any disagreement between them with respect to the
preparation of the Final Calculations, then each Party shall deliver
simultaneously to BDO Seidman, LLP (or if such firm is unwilling or unable to
serve, another nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed on by
the Parties; the accounting firm ultimately chosen, the "Accountants") the
Objection Notice and such work papers and other reports and
information relating to the disputed matter(s) as the Accountants may request
and shall be afforded the opportunity to discuss the disputed matter(s) with
the Accountants. The Accountants shall have thirty (30) days to carry out a
review and prepare a written statement of its determination regarding
the disputed matter(s) (including a statement regarding the
Accountants' determination of the prevailing Party in any such disputed
matter) which determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Any
fees and expenses of the Accountants incurred in resolving the disputed
matter(s) shall be borne as determined by the Accountants.

 

 

(iv) Subject to the netting provisions of Section 2.4(e), if the Final
Effective Time Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Effective Time
Net Working Capital, then the Parties shall direct that such difference be
immediately disbursed from the Escrow Account to Buyer. Subject to the
netting provisions of Section 2.4(e), if the Final Effective Time Net Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital,
Buyer shall promptly pay such excess to Sellers in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Sellers.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-14-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Collection of Accounts Receivable. From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall undertake to collect all accounts receivable listed on the
Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital in the ordinary course of
business consistent with the Company's past practices. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within ninety (90)
days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers (simultaneously
with the delivery of the Final Calculations) a schedule setting forth
adjustments to the Purchase Price for the failure by the Company to collect
in full any accounts receivable included in the calculation of the Final
Effective Time Net Working Capital. Subject to the netting provisions of
Section 2.4(e), within three (3) Business Days of the delivery by Buyer of
such schedule to Sellers, the Parties shall direct that any such adjustment
payable by Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) be immediately disbursed
from the Escrow Account to Buyer. After the adjustment set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Buyer will continue to collect such
accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business consistent with the
Company's past practices, and to the extent that the Company receives payment
denoted as specifically on account of any such receivable, Buyer hereby
agrees to promptly pay the amount collected to Sellers in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Any disputes between the Parties
with respect to the adjustment in this Section 2.4(b) shall be handled with
the same dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 2.4(a)(iii).

 

 

(c) Post-Closing Cash Settlements. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, and in any event within ninety (90) days
thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers (simultaneously with
the delivery of the Final Calculations) a schedule setting forth adjustments
to the Purchase Price for current assets and liabilities having post-Closing
cash settlements within the prospective 12-month period but excluded from the
determination of Net Working Capital as indicated on Exhibit E. Subject to
the netting provisions of Section 2.4(e), if the final post-Closing cash
settlements described above are greater than the estimated post-Closing cash
settlements made pursuant to Section 2.3(c), the Parties shall direct that
the amount of such excess be immediately disbursed from the Escrow Account to
Buyer. Subject to the netting provisions of Section 2.4(e), if the final
post-Closing cash settlements described above are less than the estimated
post-Closing cash settlements made pursuant to Section 2.3(c), Buyer shall
promptly pay such difference to Sellers in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Any disputes between the Parties with respect to
such adjustment shall be handled with the same dispute resolution procedure
set forth in Section 2.4(a)(iii).

 

 

(d) Federal Income Tax Adjustment. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within ninety (90)
days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a schedule
setting forth adjustments to the Purchase Price for Post-Effective Time
Taxes. Subject to the netting provisions of Section 2.4(e), within three (3)
Business Days of the delivery by Sellers of such schedule to Buyer, Buyer
shall promptly pay such difference to Sellers in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Any disputes between the Parties with respect to
such adjustment shall be handled with the same dispute resolution procedure
set forth in Section 2.4(a)(iii).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-15-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Settlement. In performing the post-Closing adjustments in this
Section 2.4, the Parties agree to use the same methodology in determining
the final adjustments to the Purchase Price as used in Exhibit E and in the
estimates at Closing pursuant to Section 2.3. In the event that an adjustment
pursuant to this Section 2.4 requires that the Parties direct a disbursement
of the Escrow Deposit to the Buyer, then for purposes of valuing the Buyer
Units to be disbursed from the Escrow Deposit, such Buyer Units shall be
valued at $13.75 per share. Once all price adjustments under this
Sections 2.4 have been finally determined, the Parties shall discharge
their obligations to pay through netting of such adjustments, in which case
the Party or Parties (as applicable) owing the greater aggregate amount in
respect of such adjustments shall pay to the other Party or Parties (as
applicable) the net amount owed; provided that if such payment is due from
the Sellers, such payment shall come from the Escrow Account.

 

 

2.5. Hurricane Repair Obligations. The Parties acknowledge that certain
assets of the Company, including the Yscloskey and Terrebonne plants,
incurred damages caused by Hurricane Gustav in 2008 ("Hurricane Damages").
The Parties agree that the actual cost to required to repair any such
Hurricane Damages, as set forth in an appropriate "authorization for
expenditure" delivered to the Company by the operator of such assets, will be
considered a "Retained Hurricane Repair Obligation" for purposes of this
Agreement and shall be governed by the indemnification provisions set forth
in Article IX hereof and shall be excluded from the adjustments to the
Purchase Price as described in Section 2.3. Furthermore, the Parties agree
that Buyer, from and after Closing, shall promptly pay all repair expenses
attributable to the Company for Hurricane Damages as set forth in an
appropriate "authorization for expenditure" delivered to the Company by the
operator of such assets. Buyer may, thereafter, make claims against the
Escrow Deposit in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article IX
hereof for the amount of such Hurricane Damages. If the amount of such
claims exceeds, either individually or in the aggregate, the cash portion of
the Escrow Deposit, Buyer may, at its sole election, either (i) retain any
and all insurance proceeds recoverable from or on account of such Hurricane
Damages or (ii) satisfy the balance of such claim with Buyer Units held in
the Escrow Deposit valued as described in Article IX. In the event Buyer
makes an election under (ii) above, all insurance proceeds recoverable from
or on account of such Hurricane Damages shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent and shall become part of the Escrow Deposit as governed by Article IX
and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
all business interruption insurance proceeds paid or payable to the
Company recoverable from or on account of such Hurricane Damages for the
period prior to the Effective Time shall be remitted by the Company to the
Sellers' Representative, for distribution to the Sellers. All
business interruption insurance proceeds paid or payable to the Company
recoverable from or on account of such Hurricane Damages for the period after
the Effective Time shall be retained by the Company and / or Buyer in Buyer's
sole discretion. Buyer shall use its Reasonable Efforts to collect any
and all property and business interruption insurance.

 

 

2.6. The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Locke Lord
Bissell and Liddell, 601 Poydras, Suite 2660, New Orleans, LA 70130,

Company. If any of the Sellers, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates shall hereafter receive any Acquisition Proposal, such Seller and
the Company shall immediately communicate the terms of such proposal to
Buyer. The term "Acquisition Proposal", as used herein, means any offer or
proposal for, or any indication of interest in, a merger, sale consolidation
or other business combination involving the Company or its assets or the
acquisition of any equity interest in the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

6.11. Nonsolicitation.

commencing upon the Closing Date and ending upon the second anniversary
thereof, either directly or indirectly, recruit or hire or attempt to recruit
or hire, directly or by assisting others, any employee, consultant, or
independent contactor of the Company; provided, that this shall not restrict
a Seller or its Affiliates from hiring an employee, consultant, or
independent contactor of the Company who responds to a general solicitation
through a newspaper, online service, recruiting firm or similar service or
medium.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-41-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The covenants contained in this Section 6.11 on the part of the Sellers
will be construed as ancillary to and independent of any other provision of
this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of the
Sellers against Buyer or any officer, director, or shareholder of Buyer,
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by Buyer of the covenants of Seller contained in
this Section 6.11.

 

 

(c)   If any Seller violates any covenant contained in this Section 6.11
and Buyer brings legal action for injunctive or other relief, Buyer shall
not, as a result of the time involved in obtaining the relief, be deprived of
the benefit of the full period of any such covenant. Accordingly, the
covenants of the Sellers contained in this Section 6.11 shall be deemed to
have durations as specified above, which periods shall commence upon the
later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date of entry by a court of
competent jurisdiction of a final judgment enforcing the covenants of such
Seller in this Section 6.11.

 

 

(d) The covenants of the Sellers contained in this Section may be assigned by
Buyer to any person to whom the business of the Company is transferred
substantially as an entirety, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that such covenants shall inure to the benefit of any successor to the
business and assets of the Company, with the same force and effect as if such
covenants had been made directly to such successor or successors.

 

 

6.12. Sellers' Representative. The Sellers hereby appoint O'Shea as
their representative ("Sellers' Representative"), who shall be one of the
Sellers or an Affiliate of one of the Sellers, to act as the representative
to the Sellers with respect to all matters under this Agreement and the
performance of the terms and provisions hereunder. In particular, the
Sellers' Representative may receive any notice hereunder for the Sellers,
such receipt being deemed delivery of such notice to all of the Sellers, and
the Sellers' Representative shall comply with the terms set forth in the
Escrow Agreement and may enforce its rights as set forth therein.
Additionally, any payments required to be paid to Sellers hereunder may be
paid to the Sellers' Representative, unless Buyer is directed otherwise.

 

 

6.13. Financial Statements. MME Unit Holdings, LLC shall make John O'Shea
and Kevin Coxon available to assist, and the Company shall use its
Reasonable Efforts to assist, Buyer in preparing financial statements of the
Company in such form and covering such periods as may be required by any
applicable securities Laws to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by Buyer as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by Buyer. MME Unit Holdings, LLC
shall make John O'Shea and Kevin Coxon available to assist, and the Company
shall use its Reasonable Efforts to cause, the independent public accountants
of the Company to provide any consent necessary to the filing of such
financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to
provide such customary representation letters as are necessary in
connection therewith.

6.14. Termination of Agreements. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers and the
Company shall have terminated, at no cost or expense to the Company, Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer, (i) each Contract with Administaff and each
Administaff Plan; (ii) all voting agreements governing the Interests, the
registration rights agreements and warrants listed on Exhibit A; (iii)
the independent contractor agreement between the Company and TGAAP
Marketing Services, LLC as disclosed on Schedule 4.22 hereof; and (iv) such
other documents and Contracts as may be requested by Buyer.

 

 

6.15. Updating Disclosure Schedules. The Company shall have the right to
update Disclosure Schedules to:

 

 

(a) add a Material Contract to Schedule 4.9, but only to the extent such
Material Contract (i) was inadvertently omitted from the Disclosure Schedules
as of the date hereof, and (ii) it does not impose any liability to the
Company outside the ordinary course of business;

 

 

(b) revise Schedule 4.4 with respect to pending litigation to the extent the
Company receives service of process after the date hereof, or any threatened
litigation to the extent that the Company obtains Knowledge after the date
hereof; provided, however, that any such matter shall be deemed to be
Retained Litigation for purposes of this Agreement;

 

 

(c) revise Schedule 4.12 with respect to environmental permitting matters to
the extent that the Company obtains Knowledge after the date hereof;
provided, however, that any such matter shall be deemed to be Retained
Environmental Obligation for purposes of this Agreement; and

 

 

(d) address matters that occur after the date hereof, but that are in
compliance with the Company's covenants set forth in Section 6.1.

 

 

To the extent the Disclosure Schedules are updated in accordance with the
foregoing, such update shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Parties,
and may not be used to claim a breach of the underlying representation.

 

 

6.16. Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits
of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale of the
Buyer Units to the public without registration, Buyer shall:

 

 

(a) make and keep public information regarding Buyer available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act for at
least one year from the acquisition by Sellers of the Buyer Units; and

 

 

(b) so long as a Seller owns any Buyer Units, furnish to such Seller
forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report

applicable, including costs and expenses associated therewith, which amounts
shall be paid by Buyer with a corresponding reduction in the Cash Payment.

 

 

6.19. Buyer Unit Distributions. Each Seller hereby waives any right it may
have to any dividend or distribution to which it may be entitled with respect
to the Buyer Units it receives hereunder for the third quarter of Buyer's
2008 fiscal year (notwithstanding the fact that such Seller may be the record
(and beneficial) holder of such Buyer Units as of the applicable record date

ARTICLE VII.

 

TAX MATTERS

 

 

7.1. Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying Taxes.

 

 

(a) Buyer and Sellers agree to treat the sale of the Interests by the Sellers
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a sale in 2008 of the Interests by
the Sellers and a purchase in 2008 of all of the assets of MMP and the MMP
Affiliated Companies (other than Sweeny) by the Buyer (as described in
Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432). The existence of MMP as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall terminate as of the
Closing Date. The parties hereby agree that (i) to the extent any Sellers
receive Buyer Units in exchange for the assignment, sale or transfer of his,
her or its Interest, the assignment of such Interest to Buyer shall be
treated as an exchange of such Interest for Buyer Units of Buyer and shall
be treated as a contribution to Buyer under Section 721 of the Code, and (ii)
to the extent any Sellers receive cash for the assignment, sale or transfer
of all or a portion of his, her or its Interest to Buyer, the parties hereby
agree to treat such assignment, sale or transfer as a sale of such Seller's
Interest for cash. If, contrary to the forgoing, the Parties hereto are
required to treat the assignment, sale or transfer of the Interests as a
merger or consolidation of the Company with and into Buyer pursuant
to Section 708(b)(2)(A) of the Code, then the parties hereto intend that:
(i) such merger or consolidation shall be treated in the manner set forth in
the Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i); (ii) this Agreement is
intended to and shall constitute an election to treat such assignment, sale
or transfer as a sale of Interests by Sellers to the extent of cash received,
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4); and (iii) to the
extent of cash received by any Seller, to treat such Sellers as selling their
respective Interest for cash pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.708-1(c)(4) and Example 5 of the Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(5). The Company shall, if not already in effect, make
the election provided by Code Section 754 in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.754-1(b) effective for the taxable year of the Company
that includes the Closing Date.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-44-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Sellers shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be
filed by or with respect to MMP and each of the MMP Affiliated Companies for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall cause to
be prepared and timely filed the federal and Louisiana income Tax Returns for
MMP and the MMP Affiliated Companies on IRS Form 1065 and Louisiana Form
IT-565 for the period that ends on the Closing Date. Buyer shall file all
other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to MMP and each of
the MMP Affiliated Companies. Sellers shall pay and be responsible for all
income Taxes owed with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall pay
and be responsible for all other Taxes for periods (or portions of
a Straddle Period, as defined below) ending on or before the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such Taxes were taken into account in
the calculation of Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital. Buyer shall
pay and be responsible for all income Taxes owed with respect to all periods
ending after the Closing Date and shall pay and be responsible for all other
Taxes (other than income taxes) for periods, (or portions of a Straddle
Period) ending after the Effective Time. Liability for Taxes (other than
income Taxes) for any Tax period that includes but does not end on the
Effective Time (a "Straddle Period") shall be apportioned between Buyer
and Sellers as follows: (i) property and similar ad valorem Taxes
or franchise Taxes based solely on capital shall be apportioned to the
Sellers for the period up to and including the Effective Time and to the
Buyer for the period after the Effective Time on a ratable daily basis; and
(ii) all other Taxes shall be apportioned between Buyer and Sellers based on
an interim closing of the books of MMP and each of the MMP Affiliated
Companies as of the Effective Time. For this purpose, any franchise Tax paid
or payable with respect to MMP or the MMP Affiliated Companies shall be
allocated to the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets
or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether
the right to do business for another taxable period is obtained by the
payment of such Tax. Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns
with respect to a Straddle Period. Buyer shall provide a copy of each such
Tax Return at least twenty (20) days before the due date for such Tax Return
along with a computation of the allocations of Tax, if any, to Sellers. Prior
to the filing of such Tax Returns, Buyer shall make any revisions or
adjustments reasonably requested by Sellers. Five (5) days before the due
date for such a Tax Return, the Sellers shall pay Buyer the excess, if any,
of the Sellers' share of the Taxes for such Straddle Period, as determined in
this Section 7.1(b), over the amount of such Taxes taken into account in
calculation of the Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital. Buyer and
Sellers shall each provide the other with all information reasonably
necessary to prepare a Tax Return. Buyer agrees not to amend Sellers'
previously filed Tax Returns without Sellers' prior consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

7.2. Responsibility for Tax Audits and Contests. Sellers shall control any
audit or contest with respect to income Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or, with respect to all other Taxes, for a period ending on or before the
Effective Time and Buyer shall control any other audit or contest; provided,
however, that the Party with the greater potential Tax liability shall
control any audit or contest with respect to a year during which a Straddle
Period occurs; provided further, that the Party so in control of an audit or
contest with respect to a Straddle Period shall allow the other Party to
participate at such other Party's cost and expense. The Party in control of
an audit or controversy shall keep the other Party informed of the status of
the audit or controversy (including providing copies of correspondence and
pleadings). Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall settle any audit or contest in a
way that would adversely affect the other Party without the other Party's
written consent, which the other Party shall not unreasonably withhold. Buyer
and Sellers shall each provide the other with all information reasonably
necessary to conduct an audit or contest with respect to Taxes.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-45-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

7.3. Tax Refunds. Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes paid with
respect to income Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or, with respect to all
other Taxes, for a period ending on or before the Effective Time. Buyer shall
be entitled to all other refunds except that refunds for a Straddle Period
shall be apportioned based on the Taxes that were paid by or on behalf of
Buyer and Sellers. If a Party receives a refund to which the other Party is
entitled, the Party receiving the refund shall pay it to the Party entitled
to the refund within two (2) Business Days after receipt.

 

 

7.4. Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Sellers shall be jointly responsible
for state or local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar
Taxes resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

7.5. Purchase Price Allocation. At least five (5) days prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver its proposed Allocation (as defined below) to
the Sellers. Sellers and Buyer shall thereafter use their best efforts
to agree on the Allocation. The Purchase Price (together with
the liabilities of the Company assumed by the Buyer) shall be allocated among
the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law, as appropriate) (the "Allocation"). Sellers and Buyer
shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on all Tax
Returns, including, but not limited to Form 8594, in a manner consistent with
the Allocation. After Closing, if the adjusted Purchase Price (as computed
under Article II) differs from the Purchase Price and if such difference
requires an adjustment to the Allocation in order for such Allocation to
comply with this Section 7.5, Sellers shall prepare such adjustment to the
Allocation which adjustment shall be submitted to Buyer, and Sellers and
Buyer shall use their best efforts to agree on the final adjustment within 30
days after the determination of the adjusted Purchase Price. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file, and deliver all
such documents, forms, and other information as Sellers may reasonably
request in preparing any required adjustment to the Allocation. If, contrary
to the intent of the parties hereto as expressed in this Section 7.5,
any Taxing authority makes or proposes an allocation different from the
Allocation determined under this Section 7.5, Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in good faith to contest such Taxing authority\'s
allocation (or proposed allocation), provided, however, that,
after consultation with the party (or parties) adversely affected by such
allocation (or proposed allocation), the other party (or parties) hereto may
file such protective claims or Tax Returns as may be reasonably required to
protect its (or their) interests.

 

 

7.6. Disputes over Tax Provisions. The Accountants shall resolve any dispute
between Buyer and Sellers over the calculation of Taxes and under this
Article VII substantially in the manner described in Section 2.3(a)(iii).

 

 

7.7. Interim Closing. With respect to determining Sellers'
distributive shares of the tax items attributable to Sweeny for the 2008
taxable year, Sellers shall use the interim closing of the books method
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii) determined as of
the Closing Date.

or arising out of any failure or breach of any representation or warranty
(without regard to the terms "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or any
derivative thereof in the representations and warranties or in any defined
terms used therein) made by the Company pursuant to Article IV under this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
(as if made anew at and as of the Closing).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-51-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3, from and after the
Closing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnity against
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer (any such Loss of the
Company shall be deemed a Loss suffered by Buyer) as a result of, relating to
or arising out of the matters more particularly described in the Special
Indemnity Agreement.

 

 

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3, from and after the
Closing Date, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnity
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer as a result of,
relating to or arising out of the Retained Compliance Matters, Retained
Environmental Obligations, Retained Hurricane Repair Obligations or the
Retained Litigation.

 

 

(e) From and after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers and their officers, members, directors, employees and
Affiliates (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered as a result of, relating to or arising out of (i) any
failure of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement to
be true and correct as of the Closing (as if made anew at and as of the
Closing), (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) the operation of the
business of the Company after the Closing Date.

 

 

(f)   Buyer's right to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of
this Article IX will not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(g) THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE IX SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION.

 

 

9.3. Limitations on Liability.

 

 

(a) In the event a Buyer Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
against an individual Seller under Section 9.2(a) hereof, then the Buyer
Indemnified Party's sole and exclusive remedy shall be, at the election of
the Buyer Indemnified Party, against (i) that respective Seller, and shall
not have an indemnification claim against any other Sellers; and/or (ii) that
respective Seller's pro rata interest in the Escrow Deposit as referenced on
Exhibit A hereto.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-52-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) A Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnity under
Section 9.2(b) of this Agreement (other than on account of a breach of
Section 4.3(b)) for Losses with respect to any claim (or group of related
claims that result from substantially the same or substantially related
circumstances) the amount of which is less than ten thousand dollars
($10,000) (the "De Minimis Threshold"), and if less than such De Minimis
Threshold such claims shall not be subject to indemnity hereunder.
Furthermore, a Buyer Indemnified Party will not be entitled to indemnity
under Section 9.2(b) of this Agreement (other than on account of a breach of
Section 4.3(b)) with respect to claims that exceed the De Minimis Threshold
until the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds one million five
hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) (the "Basket Amount"),
and thereafter, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnity for the amount in excess of the Basket Amount. For the avoidance
of doubt, any claim for Losses that exceeds the De Minimis Threshold shall
be weighted 100% (i.e. back to first dollar) in filling the Basket Amount,
which Basket Amount shall serve as a deductible. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the De Minimis Threshold and the Basket Amount shall not apply
with respect to any claim related to Section 4.3(b) (Capitalization).

 

 

(c) In the event a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity under
Section 9.2(b),(c), or (d) of this Agreement, any such claim may be
satisfied solely and exclusively against the Escrow Account. Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall have no further right to indemnity under
Section 9.2(b),(c),or (d) at such time as all Buyer Units and cash have
been disbursed from the Escrow Account. Under no circumstance shall a Buyer
Indemnified Party be entitled to recover an indemnity claim arising
under Section 9.2(b), (c), or (d) of this Agreement directly against
a Seller.

 

 

(d) In the event a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity under
Section 9.2 (a), (c), or (d) of this Agreement, any such claim for
indemnity shall not be subject to the De Minimis Threshold or the
Basket Amount.

 

 

(e) Except as provided in Section 2.5, the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this Article IX shall be reduced or reimbursed, as the
case may be, by any third party insurance proceeds or third party recoveries,
less the costs expended for such recoveries. Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Buyer Indemnified Parties to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
any amounts available under such insurance coverage and from such other third
party alleged to have responsibility. If a Buyer Indemnified Party receives
an amount under insurance coverage or from such third party with respect to
Losses that were the subject of indemnification under this Article IX at any
time subsequent to indemnification provided thereunder, then such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Seller(s), as applicable.

 

 

9.4. Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

 

 

(a) If any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under
Section 9.2 (an "Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a third
party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under Section 9.2, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (i)
notify the Party obligated to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2
above, (the "Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim and
(ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("Claim Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy
of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified
Party's best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party
Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification
under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall
not affect the right of the Indemnified Party's indemnification hereunder,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay
or omission.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-53-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Subject to Section 9.4(e) below, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (such election to be
without prejudice to the right of the Indemnified Party to dispute whether
such claim is an identifiable Loss under this Article IX), then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a
final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 9.4(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided further, that such consent shall not be required if (i) the
settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by
the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by
the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or
restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest,
including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting
the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 9.4(b), and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

 

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 9.4(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend,
and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently
by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may
not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Party's
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 9.4(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-54-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by
giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but
in any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party
becomes aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all
available material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of damages that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period
of five (5) Business Days within which to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such five (5)
Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall retain control over the
defense of any Third Party Claim as it relates to the Retained Litigation,
for so long as any Party, or the Company is actively contesting or defending
against any charge, complaint, action, suit, proceeding hearing,
investigation, claim, or demand in connection with any of the Retained
Litigation, Sellers shall, at their sole cost and expense, (i) cooperate with
and pay the fees and expenses of counsel for the Company in the defense or
contest of such Retained Litigation, (ii) make available their personnel, and
provide such testimony and access to their books and records as shall be
necessary in connection with the defense or contest of such Retained
Litigation, (iii) provide timely status reports to Buyer regarding the
Retained Litigation; and (iv) timely pay in full all judgments,
settlements and other awards for which the Company may become obligated.
Sellers shall defend any Retained Litigation in good faith and have full
control of such defense and proceedings; provided, however, that Sellers
may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Retained Litigation
without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer may participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement controlled by Sellers pursuant to this
Section 9.4(e), and Buyer shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation.

 

 

(f)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall retain control over the
defense of any Third Party Claim as it relates to the Retained Environmental
Obligations as well as any action required by a Governmental Authority as it
relates to the Retained Environmental Obligations. After Closing, Buyer
shall promptly commence such curative efforts and remedial actions to address
the Retained Environmental Obligations, the cost and expenses of which will
be covered by the Escrow Deposit. Sellers shall assist in such effort with
Buyer and any third party consultants who have advised Buyer with respect to
this Agreement and such Retained Environmental Obligations.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-55-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Furthermore, Buyer may not enter into any compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim or incur any expense related to the Retained
Environmental Obligations if indemnification is to be sought hereunder,
without the express written consent of the Sellers' Representative, which
will not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

9.5. Waiver of Consequential Damages. Except as provided in Section 9.6
below, with respect to any and all Losses for which indemnification may be
available hereunder, each party hereby expressly waives any consequential,
indirect and special damages with respect to a claim against the other party
hereto; provided, however, that this waiver shall not apply to the extent
such consequential, indirect or special damages are awarded in a Proceeding
brought or asserted by a third party against an Indemnified Party.

 

 

9.6. Damages for Lost Profits.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that (i) a Buyer Indemnified Party has a "Qualified Indemnification Claim"
(as defined below), and (ii) the facts or circumstances forming the basis of
such Qualified Indemnification Claim either result in the termination of a
Material Contract by the other party thereto, or otherwise prohibit the
Company from performing its obligations under a Material Contract, then the
parties agree that "Losses" incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Party shall
include those profits that would have otherwise been realized by the Company
under the respective Material Contract during the period of non-performance
(or following termination), which shall in no event exceed the term of such
Material Contract ("Lost Profits"). For the avoidance of doubt, Lost Profits
shall not be subject to limitation in any manner on account of the waiver of
consequential damages referenced in Section 9.5 above.

 

 

(b) In the event there is a Qualified Indemnification Claim that could
reasonably be expected to result in Lost Profits, Buyer shall be obligated to
take Reasonable Efforts to mitigate the amount of any such Lost Profits.

 

 

(c) In the event that, following the procedures set forth in Section 9.4, it
is determined that the Buyer Indemnified Party has asserted a
Qualified Indemnification Claim and may be entitled to Lost Profits
hereunder, the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall use their
Reasonable Efforts for a period of thirty (30) days to mutually agree on the
amount of the respective Lost Profits. If, following such thirty (30) day
period, Buyer and the Sellers' Representative are unable to agree on the
amount of the Lost Profits, then within ten (10) days thereafter, the matter
shall be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators (the
"Arbitration Panel"). Each of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
shall select one member of the Arbitration Panel, who will then select the
third member. If the arbitrators selected by the Buyer and
Sellers' Representative cannot agree on a third arbitrator, the third
arbitrator shall be selected by the rules of the American Arbitration
Association. In submitting the dispute to the Arbitration Panel, the Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative shall each prepare a detailed statement in
support of their calculation of the Lost Profits, including impact of any
mitigation efforts. The Arbitration Panel shall then determine the amount of
any Lost Profits by choosing between the statement prepared by the Buyer or
the statement prepared by the Sellers'


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-56-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) Representative, and shall not have authority to select any alternate
calculation. The vote of two members of the Arbitration Panel shall be
determinative, and shall not require a unanimous decision. The decision of
the Arbitration Panel shall be in writing, and shall be binding on the
parties. The Arbitration Panel shall have the discretion to require the non-
prevailing party to pay the costs associated with the arbitration and the
attorneys' fees of the prevailing party. Otherwise, the costs associated with
the arbitration shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Sellers.

 

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Qualified Indemnification
Claim" shall be limited to situations in which a Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnity under (x) Section 9.2(b) based on a breach of
Section 4.9(c) (Enforceability of Contracts), Section 4.12 (Environmental
Matters), Section 4.13 (Compliance with Laws), the last sentence of Section
4.17(c) (Condition of Assets), or Section 4.24 (Pipeline Easements and
Rights of Way); (y) Section 9.2(c) (Special Indemnity Agreement); or (z)
Section 9.2(d) of this Agreement (Retained Litigation and Retained
Environmental Obligations).

 

 

(f) The parties agree that this Section 9.6 relates only to the measure of
Losses in certain limited situations following a Qualified Indemnification
Claim, and that it does not otherwise expand the rights and remedies of a
Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder.

 

 

9.7. Waiver of Other Representations.

 

 

(a) EXCEPT THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT
OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE OR WRITTEN STATEMENT FURNISHED, OR TO BE FURNISHED TO
BUYER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NEITHER SELLERS NOR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE OR IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF THE
COMPANY ITS BUSINESS OR ANY OF ITS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OPERATIONS,
INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS RELATING
TO THE COMPANY, AND ANY SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY
DISCLAIMED.

 

 

(b) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SELLERS' INTERESTS IN
THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE SALE OF THE
INTERESTS "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," AND SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS OR THE
PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE COMPANY
AND ITS ASSETS.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-57-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.8. Exclusive Remedy. The indemnifications and remedies set forth in
this Agreement shall, from and after the Closing, constitute the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to any breach of
representation or warranty or non-performance, partial or total, of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement; provided that nothing in
this Section 9.8 shall prevent either Party from seeking (i) injunctive or
equitable relief, including, but not limited to specific performance, in
pursuit of its indemnification claims or remedies under this Agreement; or
(ii) an appropriate remedy arising out of or related to a Party's fraud or
criminal activity.

 

 

9.9. Valuation of Escrow Indemnity Claims. In the event that an indemnity
claim pursuant to this Article IX requires that the Parties direct a
disbursement of the Escrow Deposit to a Buyer Indemnified Party, then for
purposes of valuing the Buyer Units to be disbursed from the Escrow Deposit,
such Buyer Units shall be valued at the average closing price reported by the
NASDAQ Global Select Market for the three-day period ending with the
disbursement date as quoted in The Wall Street Journal.

 

 

ARTICLE X.

 

TERMINATION

 

 

10.1. Termination. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

 

 

(a) by the mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers as evidenced in writing signed
by each of Buyer and Sellers;

 

 

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a breach by Sellers or the Company of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement that
has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer
at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of
being cured, such breach has not been cured by Sellers or the Company within
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Buyer;

 

 

(c) by Sellers, if there has been a breach by Buyer of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement that has prevented the
satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Sellers at the Closing
and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of being cured, such
breach has not been cured by Buyer within thirty (30) days after written
notice thereof from Sellers;

 

 

(d) by either Buyer or Sellers if any Governmental Authority having
competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree,
ruling or injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

 

 

(e) by either Buyer or Sellers, if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been consummated by October 31, 2008, provided that neither Buyer nor
Sellers will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(e) if such Person's breach of this Agreement has prevented
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-58-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated under
Section 10.1, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement
will terminate without further liability or obligation of either Party to the
other Parties hereunder; provided, however, that no Party will be released
from liability hereunder if this Agreement is terminated and the transactions
abandoned by reason of (a) failure of such Party to have performed its
material obligations under this Agreement or (b) any material
misrepresentation made by such Party of any matter set forth in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 10.2 will relieve any Party to this
Agreement of liability for breach of this Agreement occurring prior to any
termination, or for breach of any provision of this Agreement that
specifically survives termination hereunder. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement.

11.2. Assignment. Except as provided below, no Party shall assign this
Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which consent will not be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns. The foregoing notwithstanding, immediately prior to Closing,
Buyer shall assign this Agreement to a newly formed Affiliate that is a
Delaware limited liability company; provided, however, that such assignment
shall not release Buyer from its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

11.3. Rights of Third Parties. Except for the provisions of Article IX, which
are intended to be enforceable by the Persons respectively referred to
therein, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties, any
right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

11.4. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein (including,
without limitation, Section 6.4), each Party shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including all
fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants.

 

 

11.5.  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile copies
hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed originals.

 

 

11.6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Schedules, the exhibits to this Agreement and any and all documents and
agreements to be delivered in connection with the Closing of the transaction
contemplated herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersede any other agreements, whether

Defined terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have such
meanings as are set forth in the Purchase Agreement (defined below).

 

 

RECITALS:

 

 

WHEREAS, reference is herein made to that certain Partnership Interest
Purchase Agreement by and among MMP, Sellers and Buyer dated September 11,
2008 (the "Purchase Agreement");

 

 

WHEREAS, MMP, Sellers and Buyer wish to amend the Purchase Agreement as
necessary to include any damage to the assets of MMP and certain affiliated

Obligation of MMP and Sellers; and

2.  Amendment to Section 2.5 of the Purchase Agreement. Section 2.5 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety by the following:

 

 

2.5 Hurricane Repair Obligations.

 

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that certain assets of the Company, including,
but not limited to, the Yscloskey and Terrebonne plants, incurred damages
caused by Hurricane Gustav in 2008 ("Hurricane Gustav Damages"). The Parties
agree that the actual cost required to repair any such Hurricane Gustav
Damages, as set forth in an appropriate "authorization for expenditure"
delivered to the Company by the operator for the Company's non-operated
assets will be considered a "Retained Hurricane Gustav Repair Obligation" for
purposes of this Agreement and shall be governed by the indemnification
provisions set forth in Article IX hereof and shall be excluded from the
adjustments to the Purchase Price as described in Section 2.3. Furthermore,
the Parties agree that Buyer, from and after Closing, shall promptly pay all
repair expenses attributable to the Company for Hurricane Gustav Damages as
set forth in an appropriate "authorization for expenditure" delivered to the
Company by the operator of such assets. Buyer may, thereafter, make claims
against the Escrow Deposit in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Article IX hereof for the amount of such Hurricane Gustav Damages. If the
amount of such claims exceeds, either individually or in the aggregate, the
cash portion of the Escrow Deposit, Buyer may, at its sole election, either
(i) retain any and all insurance proceeds recoverable from or on account of
such Hurricane Gustav Damages or (ii) satisfy the balance of such claim with
Buyer Units held in the Escrow Deposit valued as described in Article IX. In
the event Buyer makes an election under (ii) above, all insurance proceeds
recoverable from or on account of such Hurricane Gustav Damages shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent and shall become part of the Escrow Deposit as
governed by Article IX and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, all business interruption insurance proceeds
paid or payable to the Company recoverable from or on account of such
Hurricane Gustav Damages for the period prior to the Effective Time shall be
remitted by the Company to the Sellers' Representative, for distribution to
the Sellers. All business interruption insurance proceeds paid or payable to
the Company recoverable from or on account of such Hurricane Gustav Damages
for the period after the Effective Time shall be retained by the Company
and/or Buyer in Buyer's sole discretion. Any deductible days under such
business interruption insurance shall be for the account of the Sellers.
Buyer shall use its Reasonable Efforts to collect any and all property and
business interruption insurance.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that certain assets of the Company, including,
but not limited to, the Yscloskey and Terrebonne plants, incurred damages
caused by Hurricane Ike in 2008 ("Hurricane Ike Damages", and collectively,
with Hurricane Gustav Damages, the "Hurricane Damages"). The Parties agree
that the actual cost required to repair any such Hurricane Ike Damages, as
set forth in an appropriate "authorization for expenditure" delivered to the
Company by the operator for the Company's non-operated assets or as
determined in good faith by Buyer for the Company's operated assets, will be
considered a "Retained Hurricane Ike Repair Obligation", and collectively
with Retained Hurricane Gustav Obligation, the "Retained Hurricane Repair
Obligation") for purposes of this Agreement and shall be governed by the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article IX hereof and shall be
excluded from the adjustments to the Purchase Price as described
in Section 2.3. Furthermore, the Parties agree that Buyer, from and
after Closing, shall promptly pay all repair expenses attributable to the
Company for Hurricane Ike Damages as set forth in an appropriate
"authorization for expenditure" delivered to the Company by the operator of
such assets. Buyer may, thereafter, make claims against the Escrow
Deposit in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article IX hereof
for the amount of such Hurricane Ike Damages, subject to offset for any
insurance proceeds recoverable from or on account of such Hurricane
Ike Damages. Notwithstanding the forgoing, all business
interruption insurance proceeds paid or payable to the Company recoverable
from or on account of such Hurricane Ike Damages for the period prior to the
Effective Time shall be remitted by the Company to the Sellers'
Representative, for distribution to the Sellers. All business interruption
insurance proceeds paid or payable to the Company recoverable from or on
account of such Hurricane Damages for the period after the Effective Time
shall be retained by the Company and/or Buyer in Buyer's sole discretion. Any
deductible days under such business interruption insurance shall be for the
account of the Sellers. Buyer shall use its Reasonable Efforts to collect any
and all property and business interruption insurance.

 

 

3.   Amendment to Section 6.8 of the Purchase Agreement. Section 6.8 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety by the following:

 

 

Section 6.8. Director and Officer Indemnification. For a period of not less
than six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Organizational Documents of MMP and each MMP Affiliate Company to continue to
include the same provisions concerning the exculpation, indemnification,
advancement of expenses to and holding harmless of, all past and present
employees, officers, agents and directors of such entity for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing as are contained in such
documents as of the date of execution of this Agreement, and Buyer shall
cause MMP and each MMP Affiliate Company to honor jointly and severally all
such provisions, including making any indemnification payments and expense
advancements thereunder. If any indemnifiable claim is asserted or made
within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of such claim shall continue to the extent
currently permitted under the relevant entity's Organizational Documents
until such claim is disposed of or all orders in connection with such claim
are fully satisfied. The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply
with respect to any breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants
under this Agreement by the Company or any Seller whether or not the period
of survival of such breached representation, warranty or covenant shall have
expired under this Agreement. The Company shall also purchase, prior to the
Closing, a run-off policy with respect to the Company's current Director and
Officer Insurance Policy, in order to extend such policy's claims coverage
(for periods prior to the Closing) for 6 years after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Seller brings a claim
alleging fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence against any person who
was an employee, officer, agent or director of MMP or any MMP Affiliate
Company prior to the Closing based on an act or omission of such person
occurring prior to the Closing, then the indemnification obligations
of Buyer, MMP and/or the respective MMP Affiliate Company shall be limited to
the coverage available under the run-off policy referenced in the prior
sentence cover such claim, provided that the employee, officer, agent or
director requesting such coverage shall be responsible for paying (or
reimbursing the Buyer, MMP or the respective MMP Affiliate Company for) any
deductible under such run-off policy.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.   Ratification. The Purchase Agreement, as hereby amended, is ratified and confirmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and effect in all respects in its original form, except as modified and amended hereby.

 

 

5.  Governing Law. This Amendment is governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the Laws that might be applicable under conflicts of Laws principles. The Parties hereto agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum for any disputes between any of the Parties hereto arising out of this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any state or federal court in Houston, Texas, and each of the Parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Amendment.

The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment. Except to the extent that a different determination or finding is mandated due to the applicable Law being that of a different jurisdiction, the Parties hereto agree that all judicial determinations or findings by a state or federal court in Houston, Texas with respect to any matter under this Amendment shall be binding. To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Amendment and (ii) submits to the personal jurisdiction of any court described above. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AMENDMENT.
