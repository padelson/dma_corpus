Inc., a Delaware corporation (&quot;<U>Parent</U>&quot;), GME, Inc., a New
Mexico corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (&quot;<U>Merger

defined in Section 8.12.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company
and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors
of Parent has approved, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the &quot;<U>Merger</U>&quot;), on the terms and subject to
the conditions provided for in this Agreement; and</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE I<BR>
<BR>
<U>The Merger</P></U>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.1    <U>The Merger</U>.  Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the New Mexico Business Corporation Act (the
&quot;<U>NMBCA</U>&quot;), at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the &quot;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&quot;).</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.2    <U>Closing</U>.  The closing of
the Merger (the &quot;<U>Closing</U>&quot;) shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no
later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), unless another time or date, or both, are agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.  The date on which the Closing is held is
herein referred to as the &quot;<U>Closing Date</U>&quot;.  The Closing will be
held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.3    <U>Effective Time</U>.  Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date
the parties shall file with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission articles

&quot;<U>Articles of Merger</U>&quot;).  The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Articles of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by
the parties hereto and specified in the Articles of Merger (the time at which
the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the &quot;<U>Effective
Time</U>&quot;).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.4    <U>Effects of the Merger</U>.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the NMBCA.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.5    <U>Articles of Organization and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation</U>.</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The articles of incorporation of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.6    <U>Directors of the Surviving
Corporation</U>.  Parent and the Company shall take all necessary actions to
cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 1.7    <U>Officers of the Surviving
Corporation</U>.  The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.</A></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>
ARTICLE 2<BR><BR>
<U>Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of<BR>
the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock
Options</P></U>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 2.1    <U>Effect on Capital
Stock</U>.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, no par value, of
the Company (&quot;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&quot;) or any shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)    <U>Capital Stock of Merger Sub</U>.  Each issued and
outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)    <U>Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned
Stock</U>.  Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger
Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)    <U>Conversion of Company Common Stock</U>.  Each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares), together with the
associated common share purchase rights issued under the Rights Agreement, dated
as of September 15, 1997, between the Company and First Security Bank, National
Association, as rights agent (as amended, the &quot;<U>Company Rights
Agreement</U>&quot;), shall be converted into the right to receive $16.50 in
cash, without interest (the &quot;<U>Merger Consideration</U>&quot;).  As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
&quot;<U>Certificate</U>&quot;) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2(b), without interest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)    <U>Dissenters' Rights</U>.  Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands the payment of fair
value of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Sections 53-15-3 and 53-15-4 of the NMBCA (the &quot;<U>Dissenting
Stockholders</U>&quot;), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (the &quot;<U>Dissenting
Shares</U>&quot;), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections 53-15-3
and 53-15-4 of the NMBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 53-15-3 and 53-15-4 of the NMBCA),
unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to the payment of fair value under the
NMBCA.  If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon.  The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of the receipt of any and all written notices received by the
Company at or prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting objecting to the Merger.
Following the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for the payment of fair value of any shares
of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the NMBCA and received by the Company relating to
stockholders' rights to payment of fair value, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for the
payment of fair value under the NMBCA.  The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.  Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant
to Section 2.2 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which dissenters'
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon
demand.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 2.2    <U>Surrender of
Certificates</U>.</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Paying Agent</U>.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates (the &quot;<U>Paying
Agent</U>&quot;).  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) upon
surrender of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.  Such funds provided to
the Paying Agent are referred to herein as the &quot;<U>Payment
Fund</U>&quot;.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Payment Procedures</U>.  Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash may
be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration.  No interest will be paid or will accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Stock</U>.  All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates.  At the close of business on the
day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
law.  Subject to Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>.  If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will pay the Merger Consideration to such Person in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Termination of Fund</U>.  Any portion of the Payment
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand.
Any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Liability</U>.  Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid from the
Payment Fund or delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Investment of Payment Fund</U>.  The Paying Agent
shall invest the Payment Fund in U.S. government or other investment grade
securities, in each case, maturing in not more than 1 year, or other investments
of comparable liquidity and credit-worthiness as directed by Parent.  Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be the property
of, and shall be paid promptly to, Parent.  Nothing contained in this Section
2.2(g) shall affect Parent's obligation to pay the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. </LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 2.3    <U>Company Stock Options and
Restricted Stock</U>.</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any Option, each Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
terminated if no Option Consideration is owed or converted into the right to
receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock then subject to the Option.  Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested
or exercisable) shall be canceled and terminated and converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option.  Except as
otherwise provided below, the Option Consideration shall be paid as soon after
the Closing Date as shall be practicable.  Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, and
to the terms of any agreement or instrument evidencing the grant of any Options,
and obtain any consents from holders of Options that, in each case, are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in
respect of any Option until any necessary consents are obtained.  Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any options, SARs,
warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof (other than pursuant to
this Section 2.3).  The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate as
of the Effective Time all its Company Stock Plans (including rights to accrued
cash balances under such plans), such termination to be effective at or before
the Effective Time.  For purposes of this Agreement, &quot;<U>Option
Consideration</U>&quot; means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock
issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable
under such Option.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any RSU, each RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive a cash amount equal to the RSU Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock then subject to the RSU.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to provide that each RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested) shall be
canceled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive a cash amount equal to the RSU Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock then subject to the RSU, free of any restriction or risk of
forfeiture.  Except as otherwise provided below, the RSU Consideration shall be
paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable.  Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the
Company Stock Plans, and obtain any consents from holders of RSUs that, in each
case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.3 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be
withheld in respect of any RSU until any necessary consents are obtained.  For
purposes of this Agreement, &quot;<U>RSU Consideration</U>&quot; means, with
respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular RSU, an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably
requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below)
in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;<U>SEC</U>&quot;) regarding
such matters.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 2.4    <U>Withholding Taxes</U>.
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Options or RSUs pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION 2.5    <U>Adjustments</U>.  If during
the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, shall occur
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares of Company Common Stock, or any similar
transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change.</P>

character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term &quot;<U>Company Material
Adverse Effect</U>&quot; shall mean any change, event, occurrence or state of

As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents

such Board determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of
state Law and after consulting with and receiving the advice of outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company's shareholders under New Mexico law, then the Company may,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (but in no event
after obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval) and after providing Parent not
less than 24 hours written notice of its intention to take such actions, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a
customary confidentiality agreement with the Company (which confidentiality
agreement must be no less favorable to the Company in any material respect
(i.e., no less restrictive with respect to the conduct of such Person) than the
Confidentiality Agreement), provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may
not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the
Company and may not restrict the Company from complying with this Section 5.3,

to such Person concurrently with its delivery to such Person and concurrently
with its delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent all such
information not previously provided to Parent, and (B) participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall take all action necessary to enforce each confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which any of them is bound (in each case, other than any such
agreement with Parent).  Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(a) by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 5.3(a) by the Company.  The Company shall provide

business day after the execution thereof.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In addition to the other obligations of the Company set
forth in this Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and

after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by,
any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover
Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the
Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts

from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or

recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or

acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related to

Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was
made in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement (other than
immaterial breaches that have not directly or indirectly resulted in the making
of such Takeover Proposal) and that such Board determines in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in
response to such Superior Proposal and within 48 hours after the expiration of
the five business day period described below, cause the Company to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal but only if the
Company shall have concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and prior thereto or
concurrently therewith paid the Termination Fee required pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7.3, but in any event only after the fifth business day following
Parent's receipt of written notice (the &quot;<U>Notice</U>&quot;) from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is prepared
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and
terminate this Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall be required
to deliver a new Notice in respect of any revised Superior Proposal (other than
immaterial revisions) from such third party or its Affiliates that the Company
proposes to accept), attaching the most current version of such agreement to
such Notice (which version shall be updated on a current basis), and only if,
during such five business day period, the Company and its Representatives shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent and Parent's Representatives to make
such adjustments in the terms of this Agreement as would enable Parent to
proceed with the Transactions on such adjusted terms and, at the end of such
five business day period, after taking into account any such adjusted terms as
may have been proposed by Parent in writing since its receipt of such Notice,
the Board of Directors of the Company has again in good faith made the
determination referred to above in this clause (y).</LI></P>

in its good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with a financial
advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the Company's
