    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 19, 2006 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among GE Fanuc Embedded Systems, Inc., a Delaware

Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.12.

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub
have approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent
has approved, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions
provided for in this Agreement; and

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree
as follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  _The Merger

_   

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the New Mexico Business
Corporation Act (the " _NMBCA_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by
the parties, which date shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another
time or date, or both, are agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
date on which the Closing is held is herein referred to as the " _Closing
Date_ ". The Closing will be held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

  

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the New
Mexico Public Regulation Commission articles of merger, executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the NMBCA (the " _Articles of
Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles
of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and
specified in the Articles of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes
effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the NMBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

SECTION 1.5 _Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 

  

 1. The articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

 2. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

SECTION 1.6 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Parent and the Company
shall take all necessary actions to cause the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

SECTION 1.7 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed
and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 ARTICLE 2 

  _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of 
 the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Company
Stock Options

_  

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, no par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or
any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares), together with the associated common
share purchase rights issued under the Rights Agreement, dated as of
September 15, 1997, between the Company and First Security Bank,
National Association, as rights agent (as amended, the " _Company
Rights Agreement_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive $16.50
in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2(b), without interest.

  

(d) _Dissenters\' Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands the payment of fair value of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
the provisions of Sections 53-15-3 and 53-15-4 of the NMBCA (the "
_Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections 53-15-3 and 53-15-4
of the NMBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Sections 53-15-3 and 53-15-4 of the
NMBCA), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to the payment of fair value under
the NMBCA. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder\'s shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock,
in accordance with Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of the receipt of any and all written notices
received by the Company at or prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting
objecting to the Merger. Following the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for the
payment of fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
NMBCA and received by the Company relating to stockholders\' rights to
payment of fair value, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for the payment of fair
value under the NMBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle,
or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section
2.2 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which dissenters\' rights
have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  

SECTION 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

   _

 1. Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) upon surrender of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_ ".

   _

 2. Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

   _

 3. Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. Subject to Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

   _

 4. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the Merger Consideration to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

   _

 5. Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration.

   _

 6. No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid from the Payment Fund or delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

   _

 7. Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund in U.S. government or other investment grade securities, in each case, maturing in not more than 1 year, or other investments of comparable liquidity and credit-worthiness as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be the property of, and shall be paid promptly to, Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 2.2(g) shall affect Parent\'s obligation to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

SECTION 2.3 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.

 

  

 1. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Option, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated if no Option Consideration is owed or converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall be canceled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option. Except as otherwise provided below, the Option Consideration shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, and to the terms of any agreement or instrument evidencing the grant of any Options, and obtain any consents from holders of Options that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Option until any necessary consents are obtained. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any options, SARs, warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof (other than pursuant to this Section 2.3). The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate as of the Effective Time all its Company Stock Plans (including rights to accrued cash balances under such plans), such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option.

  

 2. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any RSU, each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the RSU Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the RSU. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested) shall be canceled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the RSU Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the RSU, free of any restriction or risk of forfeiture. Except as otherwise provided below, the RSU Consideration shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, and obtain any consents from holders of RSUs that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any RSU until any necessary consents are obtained. For purposes of this Agreement, " _RSU Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular RSU, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock.

  

 3. The Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below) in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") regarding such matters.

  

SECTION 2.4 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Options or
RSUs pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

SECTION 2.5 _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares of Company Common Stock, or any similar transaction,
or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

  

 

ARTICLE 3 
  
  _Representations and Warranties of the Company

_   

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule (each section of which
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty to the
extent expressly specified therein and such other representations and
warranties to the extent a matter in such section of the disclosure schedule
is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information called
for by such other representation and warranty readily apparent) delivered by
the Company to Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

 

  

 1.

The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal; _provided, however_ , that if after the date hereof the Board of Directors of the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement (other than immaterial breaches that have not directly or indirectly resulted in the making of such Takeover Proposal), and the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and with respect to which such Board determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state Law and after consulting with and receiving the advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under New Mexico law, then the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval) and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours written notice of its intention to take such actions, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement must be no less favorable to the Company in any material respect (i.e., no less restrictive with respect to the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement), provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from complying with this Section 5.3, and (2) the Company advises Parent of all such non-public information delivered to such Person concurrently with its delivery to such Person and concurrently with its delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent all such information not previously provided to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall take all action necessary to enforce each confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (in each case, other than any such agreement with Parent). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(a) by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3(a) by the Company. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph no later than the earlier of 48 hours or one business day after the execution thereof.

  

 2. In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in no event later than the later of 48 hours or one business day after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent fully informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

  

 3. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(c), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(a)) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover Proposal, if such Board determines in good faith, after reviewing applicable provisions of state Law and after consulting with and receiving advice from outside counsel, that the failure to make such withdrawal, modification or recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under New Mexico law and (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was made in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement (other than immaterial breaches that have not directly or indirectly resulted in the making of such Takeover Proposal) and that such Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to such Superior Proposal and within 48 hours after the expiration of the five business day period described below, cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal but only if the Company shall have concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and prior thereto or concurrently therewith paid the Termination Fee required pursuant to Section 7.3, but in any event only after the fifth business day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice (the " _Notice_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is prepared to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice in respect of any revised Superior Proposal (other than immaterial revisions) from such third party or its Affiliates that the Company proposes to accept), attaching the most current version of such agreement to such Notice (which version shall be updated on a current basis), and only if, during such five business day period, the Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and Parent\'s Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms of this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the Transactions on such adjusted terms and, at the end of such five business day period, after taking into account any such adjusted terms as may have been proposed by Parent in writing since its receipt of such Notice, the Board of Directors of the Company has again in good faith made the determination referred to above in this clause (y).

  

 4. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 15% or more of the
Company\'s consolidated assets or to which 15% or more of the Company\'s
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions) of 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case,
other than the Transactions.

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written offer obtained after the
date hereof not in breach of this Agreement (other than immaterial breaches
that have not directly or indirectly resulted in the making of such Takeover
Proposal) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of
cash and/or securities, all of the equity securities of the Company or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, made by a third party, which is not subject to a
financing contingency and which is otherwise on terms and conditions which a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
national reputation) to be more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders from
a financial point of view than the Merger and the other Transactions, taking
into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this
Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing and the
ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions
contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among other things,
the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining
required approvals).

  

 5. Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if such Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or the approval of this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 7.1(c)(iii) of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 5.4 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

  

 1.

 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, enter into any consent decree, make any divestiture, accept any operational restriction or take or commit to take any action that would reasonably be expected to limit: (i) the freedom of action of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of, or Parent\'s ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, or (ii) Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' or Affiliates\' ability to retain, own or operate any portion of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries.

the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which
