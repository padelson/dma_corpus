a transaction described in Situation 1 of Rev. Rul. 99-6, 199-1 C.B. 432
(i.e., as a sale of the Seller Interests by Seller and an acquisition of
assets by Buyer) for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by a change in Law after the date hereof,
a closing agreement with an applicable Tax authority or a final non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If the purchase of
the Management Interests and the MIU Interests are consummated on the Closing
Date, within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a draft of a statement setting forth a proposed allocation (the "
_Allocation_ ") of the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration (as well
as liabilities assumed or deemed assumed for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
to the extent relevant) among SellerÂ’s share of the assets of the Company in
a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code, together with reasonable
supporting information and calculations. Seller shall inform Buyer in writing
within 45 days after the receipt of such draft of any objection by Seller to
the Allocation. To the extent that any such objection is received, Buyer and
Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes within 15 days
following the receipt of such objection. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
reach such agreement within 15 days after receipt by Buyer of such notice,
Seller and Buyer shall jointly

 



9  select and retain a nationally recognized accounting firm that is not the
auditor or independent accounting firm of any of the Parties (the "
_Independent Accountant_ ") to resolve the disputed items. Any determination
by the Independent Accountant shall be final. The Independent Accountant shall
resolve any disputed items within 15 days after having the item referred to it
pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. The
Allocation (as determined by agreement of the Parties or by the Independent
Accountant, as the case may be) shall be binding on the Parties, who shall
file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocation unless
otherwise required by a change in Applicable Law occurring after the date of
the final determination of the Allocation, a closing agreement with an
applicable Tax authority or a final non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction. If the purchase of the Management Interests and the
MIU Interests are not consummated on the Closing Date, the Parties agree to
use the mechanics set forth above to determine the value of the CompanyÂ’s
assets for purposes of applying Sections 743 and 751 of the Code.

2.5  _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
Seller such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under Applicable Law; _provided_ that Buyer shall notify Seller of its
determination to withhold prior to Closing and the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize to the extent permissible under Applicable Law the
amount of any such deduction or withholding, including by providing any
certificates or forms that are reasonably requested to establish an exemption
from (or reduction in) any deduction or withholding. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

State of Delaware. Buyer is duly authorized, qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation or other organization in good standing in
each of the jurisdictions in which it is required to be so

approved by all necessary corporate and other action on the part of Buyer and
such Affiliate of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Buyer and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be (a) limited by any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (b) subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). At the Closing, each other Transaction Document to which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party shall be a valid and legally binding
obligation of Buyer or such Affiliate, in each case enforceable against Buyer
or such Affiliates of Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be (i) limited by any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered

Agreement, nor the execution and delivery by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of
any other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is or
will be a party, nor the consummation by Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, does or will (a) conflict
with, or result in the breach of any provision of, the Charter Documents of
Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer or any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other

 



12  agreement, permit, franchise or license to which Buyer or any such Affiliate
is a party or by which Buyer or any such Affiliate (or their respective
properties or assets) are bound or (b) violate any Applicable Law or any
permit, order, award, injunction, decree or judgment of any Governmental
Authority applicable to or binding upon Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer or to
which any of its properties or assets are subject. 

4.4 _No Consents_. No Governmental Approvals or consents of any Third Person
are required for the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the other Transaction Documents to which
Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer is or will be a party or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for
Antitrust Approvals or as have already been obtained.

4.5 _No Brokers_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates nor any of
their respective officers, directors or employees, on behalf of Buyer or such
Affiliates, has employed any broker or finder or incurred any other liability
for any brokerage fees, commissions or findersÂ’ fees in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.6 _Securities Matters_. Buyer is an accredited investor as defined in
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Buyer is acquiring the Purchased
Interests for its own account for investment and not with a view to, or for
sale or other disposition in connection with, any distribution of all or any
part thereof, except in compliance with Applicable Laws, nor with any present
intention of distributing or selling any of the Purchased Interests.

4.7 _Valid Issuance_. The Stock Consideration has been duly authorized, and
when issued and delivered by Buyer as provided in this Agreement, the Stock
Consideration will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not
subject to preemptive rights.

4.8 _Public Disclosure; Financial Statements_. (a) Buyer has timely filed or
furnished all registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and any amendments
thereto) required to be so filed or furnished by it with the Commission since
January 1, 2015 (collectively, the " _Buyer Reports_ "). As of their
respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the Buyer
Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and complied in all material respects with applicable accounting standards. As
of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment),
the Buyer Reports did not contain any

 



13  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Buyer Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Buyer and its subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity
included in or incorporated by reference into the Buyer Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) complied in all material respects, when filed or
if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment, with the rules and regulations of the Commission with respect
thereto and fairly presents, in all material respects, the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity, as the case may
be, of Buyer and its subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to (i) such exceptions as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission and (ii) normal year-end
audit adjustments which have not been and are not expected to be material),
in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved.

 

(c) Buyer keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and maintains a
system of internal controls, in each case as required pursuant to Section
13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. Buyer has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of NYSE. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Buyer in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to its
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) There are no liabilities or obligations of Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether
or not required to be disclosed) that would be required to be reflected on, or
reserved against in, a balance sheet of Buyer or in the notes thereto prepared
in accordance with GAAP, other than liabilities or obligations to the extent
(i) (A) reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Buyer or (B) readily apparent in the notes thereto, in each case included
in BuyerÂ’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017,
(ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business since June 30, 2016 or (iii)
such liabilities or obligations have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Buyer.

 



14 4.9 _Listing_. The issued and outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock are
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for
trading on the NYSE under the symbol "FET". There is no suit, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against Buyer by the NYSE or the Commission with respect to any intention by
such entity to deregister the Buyer Common Stock or prohibit or terminate the
listing of Buyer Common Stock on the NYSE. Buyer has taken no action that is
designed to terminate the registration of Buyer Common Stock under the
Exchange Act.

4.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2016, there has
not been any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer or any event,
occurrence, change, discovery or development of a state of circumstances or
facts which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer.

4.11 _Compliance with Laws_. Each of Buyer and its subsidiaries (i) is, and
has been for the previous three years, in compliance with all Applicable Laws
and (ii) to the knowledge of Buyer, has not received notice from any
Governmental Authority that it is not in compliance with any Applicable Law,
in each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Buyer.

6.1  _Cooperation and Reasonable Efforts_. The Parties agree to cooperate

Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over Antitrust Laws (each such
Governmental Authority, an " _Antitrust Authority_ ") information and
documents requested by any Antitrust Authority as necessary and appropriate
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related
material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings
under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of the filings under the HSR
Act, the Parties shall file with the FTC and the DOJ the notification and
report form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby within 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
(ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR
Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents
or other materials received by each of them or any of their respective
Affiliates in respect of such filings or such transactions and (iii) cooperate

resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority with respect to any
such filing or any such transaction. Each of Buyer and Seller shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
Applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall independently
participate, or permit any Affiliate to participate, in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other Party prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting. Subject to Applicable Law and appropriate
confidentiality arrangements, Buyer and Seller will consult and cooperate
with one

 



17  another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party or any of its Affiliates relating to proceedings under
the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws. The Parties agree that each
Party shall have sole responsibility for its respective filing fees associated
with HSR Act filings and any other similar filings required under applicable
Antitrust Laws in any other jurisdiction.

6.2 _Use of Intellectual Property_. Buyer and Seller each acknowledge that,

associated logos and trademarks or service marks. From the time of the
Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall refrain from using or disclosing the
Intellectual Property.

 

6.3 _Management Owners and MIU Holders_. Within two Business Days following
the date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall (i) notify the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the Company to
deliver to each Management Owner and MIU Holder a drag notice in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (each, a " _Drag Notice_ "), in each case in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2 of the LLCA (it being understood
that each Drag Notice shall constitute a Drag-Along Notice pursuant to the
LLCA). Each Drag Notice shall set forth the amount that will be the Aggregate
Purchase Price (as defined in the LLCA) applicable to such Drag Sale (it being
understood that for purposes of calculating the Aggregate Purchase Price, the
deemed per share value of the Stock Consideration shall be as set forth in
_Schedule 6.3_). Following the delivery of the Drag Notices, Buyer shall
offer to enter into purchase and sale agreements in the form attached to each
Drag Notice (each, a " _PSA_ ") with all of the Management Owners and MIU
Holders in respect of all of the Management Interests and the MIU Interests
(including the MIU Interests attributable to unallocated Management Incentive
Units) (the " _Drag Subject Interests_ "), with such changes thereto as may
be agreed to between Buyer and the applicable Management Owner or MIU Holder
(it being understood that (i) the consideration payable to the MIU Holders and
Management Owners in such Drag Sale shall be allocated in accordance with the
LLCA (including Sections 9.2 and Section 4.4 of the LLCA) and (ii) Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer regarding the allocation of the
unallocated Management Incentive Units which, for the avoidance of doubt,
requires the approval of the Board of Directors (as defined in the LLCA) in
accordance with the LLCA to the extent not allocated on a pro rata basis). At
or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall enter into a PSA with all of the
Management Owners and MIU Holders in respect of all of the Drag Subject
Interests or otherwise consummate a Drag Sale with respect to the Drag Subject
Interests; _provided, however,_ that Buyer shall not be required to consummate
a Drag Sale with respect to the applicable Drag Subject Interests at or prior
to Closing if (i) the applicable Management Owner or MIU Holder refuses to
execute a PSA after reasonable efforts by Buyer and (ii) all of the
unallocated Management Incentive Units have been fully allocated by the Board
of Directors (as defined in the LLCA) in accordance with the LLCA prior to
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event a Drag Sale in respect of all of the Drag Subject Interests is not
consummated contemporaneously with Closing, Buyer shall (i) take all steps
necessary to permit Seller to comply with the provisions of Section 9.3 of

 



18  the LLCA with respect to any Membership Interests not acquired by Buyer
contemporaneously with Closing and (ii) purchase any such Membership Interests
elected to be sold by any Management Owner to Buyer in connection with the
application of Section 9.3 of the LLCA.

6.4 _Confidentiality_. Those provisions in the LLCA concerning Confidential
Information (as defined in the LLCA) acquired by Seller from the Company prior
to the Closing shall continue to apply to Seller from and after the Closing as
if Seller remained a Member (as defined in the LLCA) from and after the
Closing for a period of three years.

6.5 _Publicity_. The Parties shall not issue any report, statement or press
release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (a) as, in the
reasonable judgment of any Party, may be legally required by Applicable Law
or by a Governmental Authority (including any filings of financial statements
by a Party or its Affiliates with the Commission), (b) in connection with a
PartyÂ’s or its AffiliatesÂ’ obligations as a publicly-held, exchange-listed
company (including disclosures required to be made in the financial statements
of any Party or of any of its Affiliates) or (c) as otherwise agreed to in
writing by the Parties. Nothing will prohibit a Party from
disclosing information consistent with any information in any press release
or other public announcement that was previously agreed to and disseminated in
compliance with this _Section 6.5_.

 

6.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement
and whether or not the Closing occurs, each Party and its respective
Affiliates shall pay (i) all expenses incurred by or on behalf of such Party
or its respective Affiliates in connection with the preparation, authorization
and execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
including all fees and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and
accountants, and (ii) all amounts payable with respect to any claim for
brokerage or findersÂ’ fees or other commissions with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based in any way on any
agreement, arrangement or understanding made by such Party or any of its
respective Affiliates.

 

6.7 _Access to Records_. For a period of six years after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, make available and provide
Seller and its representatives with reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and records of the Company for
the period from July 1, 2013 to and including the Closing Date to the extent
such access is reasonably required to defend itself in any dispute by a third
party related to the Company. This _Section 6.7_ shall not apply to matters
with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by _Section 6.8_. 

 



19 6.8 _Taxes._

 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns,
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax items
of the Company. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another
PartyÂ’s reasonable request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.
The Parties further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby). The Parties agree (i) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority and (ii) to give the other Parties reasonable
written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if any other Party so requests, to allow such other Party to take
possession of such books and records (other than any books and records
related to income Taxes of Buyer or Seller). If the purchase of the Management
Interests and the MIU Interests are not consummated on the Closing Date, the
Parties shall cooperate in making an election under Section 754 of the Code
for the Company and any similar election with respect to any subsidiary of the
Company.

 

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear 50% of all applicable Transfer Taxes
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Party responsible for filing the Tax Returns under Applicable Law relating to
such Transfer Taxes will, and will cause such PartyÂ’s Affiliates to, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by Applicable Law, the
other Parties will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 

6.9 _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree from time to time to take such
actions as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
(including the execution and delivery of such further documents and
instruments) as any Party may reasonably request, all at the sole expense of
the requesting Party (except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement).

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, WAIVER AND MODIFICATION

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing
Date (a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller or (b) by either
Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before November
1, 2017; _provided_ , that, if the condition set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_
 shall be the only condition to Closing not satisfied (or capable of being
satisfied were the Closing otherwise to occur) on or prior to such date, then
neither Buyer nor Seller may unilaterally terminate this Agreement prior to
January 31, 2018. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to clause (b) of the previous sentence if the failure of Closing to
occur shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform each of its obligations under this Agreement required to
be performed by it at or prior to the Closing Date.

 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided above, there shall be no further liability or obligation on the
part of any of the Parties, except and to the extent such termination results
from the willful and material breach by a Party of any of its covenants or
agreements hereunder, and that, as soon as practicable following termination,
the Parties shall mutually agree on and release a joint public announcement of
the termination of this Agreement.

 



23 7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement (including this _Section 7.3_ ) may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing executed and delivered by the
Parties. The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance
of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right at a later time to
enforce the same. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or of any breach
of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further
or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other
condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant, representation or
warranty. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any
interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or
discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any
Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

7.4 _Extension/Waiver_. At any time, a Party solely with respect to itself,
may: (a) with respect to obligations owed to it or the performance of other
acts for its benefit, extend the time for the performance of such obligations
or such other acts to be performed hereunder by another Party; (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of another Party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance
with any of the conditions to the obligations of a Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party. No such waiver shall be operative as a waiver of any other or
subsequent requirement of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 8

contained in this Agreement which by its terms requires performance after the

reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any Party
(including by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise) except with the prior
written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that Buyer may assign its
right to purchase all or any portion of the Purchased Interests to one or
more of its wholly owned subsidiaries (it being agreed that no such assignment
shall release Buyer from any of its liabilities or obligations under this
Agreement). Any purported assignment of this Agreement in violation of this
_Section 8.4_ shall be null and void.

8.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Applicable Law

render such provision valid, legal and enforceable and in a manner so as to
preserve the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



27 8.10 _No Strict Construction_. The Parties acknowledge that each of them
has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the

they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this
Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties, and the
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person and any rule of law that
would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement
against the Party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived.

8.11 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver_. Each of the
Parties agrees that it shall bring any Proceeding in respect of any Claim
arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether in tort or contract or at

process upon it may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered
or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
prepaid, to it at its address specified in _Section 8.6_. The foregoing
consents to jurisdiction and service of process shall not constitute general
consents to service of process in the State of Texas for any purpose except
as provided herein and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person
other than the Parties. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
