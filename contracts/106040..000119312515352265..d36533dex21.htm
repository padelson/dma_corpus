to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or
restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

(e) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of equivalent capital
stock, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(f) (i) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue
of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of Company Common Stock that
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise
would be received by such holder), shall, upon surrender of such holders
Certificate(s) or Book Entry Share(s) or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in
_Section 3.2(g)_, be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu
thereof, which payment shall (subject to _Section 3.1(f)(i)_) represent such
holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds (after commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including customary
expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with such sale) from the sale by
the Exchange Agent on behalf of such holders of the fractions of shares of
Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be issued (the "Excess Shares"),
which sales shall be executed from time to time as appropriate. The sales of
Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq through one or
more brokers nominated by Parent with the sale proceeds being remitted to the
Exchange Agent as soon as practicable thereafter. Until the net proceeds of
such sale have been distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock
entitled thereto, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds as part of the
Consideration Fund. Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (or as the
Exchange Agent may request from time to time) the Excess Shares for sale in
accordance with this _Section 3.1(f)(i)_.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 3.1(f)(i)_, Parent may elect
at its option, exercised prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the issuance
and sale of Excess Shares and the making of the payments hereinabove
contemplated, to pay each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such former holder (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by
such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Parent Measurement
Price. 

 



26 (g) In the event that on the Closing Date, the Available Cash is less than the
Target Available Cash:

(i) If the Unis Closing Date has occurred, at the election of Parent, (A) the
Base Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the Per
Share Cash Reduction Amount, (B) the Base Stock Consideration shall be
increased by the Per Share Additional Equity Amount, and (C) the Base Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect the revised consideration; and

(ii) If the Unis Closing Date has not occurred, at the election of Parent, (A)
the Alternate Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
Per Share Cash Reduction Amount, (B) the Alternate Stock Consideration shall
be increased by the Per Share Additional Equity Amount, and (C) the Alternate
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect the revised consideration.

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary
exchange agreement with a nationally recognized institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations
of the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this  _Article III_ , (i) if the Unis Closing Date has occurred, (A) cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Base Cash Consideration payable to all holders
of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ (together with, to
the extent applicable, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)(i)_ ) and (B) certificates (or
evidence of shares in book entry form) representing the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Base Stock
Consideration payable to all holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)(B)_ (such cash and certificates, together with
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)(i)_ and any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, the " _Consideration Fund_ ") or (ii) if the Unis Closing
Date has not occurred or the Unis Investment has been terminated, (A) cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Alternate Cash Consideration payable to all
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(A)_ (together
with cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)(i)_) and (B) certificates (or evidence of

 



27  shares in book entry form) representing the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Alternate Stock Consideration
payable to all holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)(ii)(B)_ (such cash and certificates, together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section
3.1(f)(i)_, if applicable and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Parent agrees to make available directly or
indirectly to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, until the
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to  _Section 3.2(e)_, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)(i)_, if applicable, and
any dividends or other distributions which a holder of Company Common Stock
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_. The Exchange Agent
shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates and Book Entry Shares
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal, in customary form,
that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or transfer of such Book
Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of the Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the
Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the
form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be as
reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the
Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in
connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share or surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, in each case together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book Entry Share or
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Book Entry Share so transferred or
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or Certificates in connection with, or
accrued on, the Merger Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book Entry Share
transferred or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Book Entry Share transferred or Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) Cash in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such investments shall
be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more
than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States. Earnings on the Exchange Fund in
excess of the amounts payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and shall be paid to
Parent. No

 



28  investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required
by this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment,
Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective
Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to
be part of the Consideration Fund.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
share transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
III_ , except as provided in _Section 3.3_ or as otherwise provided by Law.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former holders of shares
of Company Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered upon request to Parent. Any holders of Certificates or Book Entry
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect
to such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
not have been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law, any such
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, and
any holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such
Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

(h) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the
date hereof with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or
other distribution in respect of all such shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares with respect
to any shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until

 



29  the holders of record of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
surrender such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holders thereof, without interest, (A)
promptly after such surrender, either the Base Merger Consideration or the
Alternate Merger Consideration, as applicable, in each case, payable
in exchange therefor pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, along with payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole share of Parent Common
Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock.

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 3.1_, but
rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in 
_Section 3.1_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 received by the Company. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Parent shall have the opportunity to participate with the Company in any
and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or
applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock
Units_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested Company Stock Option
and each outstanding Underwater Option shall, without any further action on
the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an option to
purchase, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Stock Option as of the date hereof, that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
volume weighted average trading price of Company Common Stock on Nasdaq for
the five (5) consecutive trading

 



30  days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date by (B)
the Parent Measurement Price (such quotient, the " _Equity Conversion Ratio_
"), at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price applicable
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2)
the Equity Conversion Ratio (each, as so adjusted, a " _Converted Parent
Option_ "); _provided_ , _that_ , if the Unis Closing Date occurs, Parent may
instead determine to settle some or all of the Converted Parent Options in
cash on the date of exercise, based upon the value of Parent Common Stock at
exercise and determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award,
less the exercise price and any required withholdings applicable to the
Converted Parent Option.

 

(b) The Converted Parent Options shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company
Equity Plans) as the Company Stock Options as of the date hereof and
otherwise shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Company Stock Options as of the date hereof.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company Stock Option
(other than any such vested Company Stock Option that is an Underwater
Option) shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration, less the exercise price and any required withholdings
applicable to such Company Stock Option (the " _Vested Option Consideration_
") (which exercise price and withholding shall first be applied against the
stock portion of the Vested Option Consideration, if any, to reduce the number
of shares delivered to the holder, and thereafter shall reduce the cash
delivered to the holder). Following the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option
to the payment described in this _Section 3.4(c)_, which shall be made or
cause to be made by the Surviving Corporation as of, or within ten (10)
Business Days after, the Effective Time.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested Company
Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into that number of restricted stock units (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of Parent Common Stock (" _Converted RSUs_ ") equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Units and (B) the Equity Conversion Ratio;
_provided_ _that_ , if the Unis Closing Date occurs, Parent may instead
determine to settle some or all of the Converted RSUs in cash on the date
of settlement, based upon the value of Parent Common Stock at settlement
determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award, less any
required withholdings applicable to the Converted RSUs. Any Converted RSUs
issued pursuant to this  _Section 3.4(d)_ shall be subject to substantially
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Restricted
Stock Units as of the date hereof.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company Restricted
Stock Unit shall, without any further action on the part of any holder
thereof, be cancelled and extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, less any required withholdings
applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Units (the " _Vested Restricted
Stock Units Consideration_ ") (which withholding shall first be applied
against the stock portion of the Vested Restricted Stock Units Consideration,
if any, to

 



31  reduce the number of shares delivered to the holder, and thereafter shall
reduce the cash delivered to the holder); _provided_ that payment of the
Merger Consideration shall be made at such other time or times following the
Effective Time consistent with the terms of the Company Restricted Stock Unit.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the provisions set forth in this _Section 3.4_
and to reflect the assumption by Parent of the Company Equity Plans;
_provided_ that no action taken by the Company shall be required to be
irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties shall,
to the extent necessary or appropriate to minimize the tax impact of the
provisions set forth in this _Section 3.4_, cooperate in good faith prior to
the Effective Time to develop a mechanism with respect to Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock Units held by individuals subject to
Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the United States to the
extent such mechanism will not have an adverse impact on, or result in
additional liability to, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates.

 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required under the Code or any other provision of applicable
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and are paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding was made.

of clauses (A) and (B), solely by reason of the execution of this Agreement,
or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iii) provide that the "Final Expiration Date" (as
defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) shall occur immediately
prior to the Effective Time. To the Companys Knowledge, no Person is an

its Subsidiaries becoming due, or increase the amount of any compensation
due, to any Service Provider, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the

Material Adverse Effect. All contributions required to be made under the terms
of any of the Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans as of the date of this
Agreement have been timely made or, if not yet due, have been properly
reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated
by reference in the Companys financial statements prior to the date of this
Agreement, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Stock or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through
derivatives, securities or otherwise) in the Company.

Section 5.9 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, except as would
not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there (a) is no action, claim, suit
or proceeding pending against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) are, to the Knowledge of
Parent, no investigations by any Governmental Entity pending or threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary
is subject to any order, decree or ruling that has had or would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.10 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of a fully executed commitment letter, together with any
related fee letters (solely in the case of the fee letters, with only (i) the
fee amounts, yield or interest rate caps, and original issue discount amounts
and (ii) "flex", "securities" demand terms, other economic terms and other
commercially sensitive terms, in each case under this clause (ii) that are
confidential and do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or
conditionality of or the aggregate amount of net proceeds available under the
Debt Financing, contained therein redacted), each in effect as of the date of
this Agreement from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch
and Royal Bank of Canada (together, as they may be amended, modified or
replaced in accordance with  _Section 6.18_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_
") to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended or modified in any manner on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and, as of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such
amendment or modification is contemplated (except to implement or exercise
the "flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters related to the Debt
Financing and to add additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents
or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof). The Debt Commitment Letter, including the commitments contained
therein, has not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect on or prior to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date hereof,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or
rescission is contemplated. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment
fees or other fees and amounts in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter
that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement; and the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, as of the
date hereof the other parties thereto, except that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium and similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought. There are no

 



56  conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount (or any
portion) of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with
the Debt Commitment Letter, the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article IV_ to the extent necessary to satisfy the condition in
_Section 7.2(a)_ and performance by the Company of its obligations under
this Agreement to the extent necessary to satisfy the condition in _Section
7.2(b)_, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, together
with available cash on hand of Parent and the Company and the Base Stock
Consideration or the Alternative Stock Consideration, as applicable, will, in
the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent and the Company to pay all of the
amounts required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the amounts payable in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and all related fees and
expenses required to be paid as of the date of the consummation of the Merger
and the funds to be provided by (or on behalf of) Parent to the Company to
enable the Company to fund any payments (if any) required to be made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any holder
of the convertible senior notes issued under the Company Indentures in
accordance with the terms of the Company Indentures and any other repayment or
refinancing of debt, if any, required by the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts
or arrangements of any kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letter to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that could impose conditions to
the funding of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to
the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time
or both) would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto,
under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees that a breach of this representation and warranty shall not result in
the failure of a condition precedent to the Companys obligations under this
Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach) Parent is willing and able to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Immediately following the Closing after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will
be Solvent. As used herein, " _Solvent_ " means with respect to any Person on
a particular date, that on such date (a) the fair value of the property of
such Person is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including,
contingent liabilities, of such Person, (b) the present fair salable value of
the assets of such Person is not less than the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts as they become
absolute and matured, (c) such Person has not incurred, and does not intend to
incur, debts or liabilities beyond such Persons ability to pay such debts and
liabilities as they mature and (d) such Person is not engaged in business or
a transaction, and is not about to engage in business or a transaction, for
which such Persons property would constitute an unreasonably small capital.
The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed under this
_Section 5.11_ as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

 



57 Section 5.12 _Vote Required_. In the event that the Unis Closing Date has not
occurred, the approval of the Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of the Parent Common Stock represented in person or by
proxy at the Parent Stockholder Meeting (or and adjournment or postponement
thereof) at which a quorum is present (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ ")
is the only vote of the holders of any of Parents share capital that may be
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company in _Section 4.2(a)_. In the
event that the Unis Closing Date occurs, no vote or consent of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Parent (including the Parent
Stockholder Approval) is necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger unless the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained.

 

Section 5.13 _Board Recommendation_. Parents board of directors has (a)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to, advisable and in
the best interests of Parent and its stockholders, (b) approved and adopted
this Agreement, including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (c) subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Parent approve the Share
Issuance (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ "), and, as of the date of this
Agreement, none of such actions by Parents board of directors has been
amended, rescinded or modified.

Section 5.14 _Capitalization and Operations of Merger Sub_. All of the issued
and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time
will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Merger Sub has not conducted
any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective
Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.15 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has, since July 3, 2015, incurred
any liabilities or obligations that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP as applied in
preparing the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries included in Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended July 3, 2015 (" _Parent Balance Sheet_ "), except for (a)
liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the Parent Balance
Sheet or in the notes thereto, (b) liabilities or obligations identified in 
_Section 5.15_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (c) liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since July 3, 2015, (d) liabilities and obligations incurred
in connection with the Merger or otherwise as expressly contemplated or
expressly permitted by this Agreement, (e) intercompany liabilities and

have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall request that all confidential or
proprietary information previously furnished to any Third Parties in
connection with such discussions and negotiations be promptly returned or

the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives may, prior to
the Company Stockholder Approval, participate in discussions or negotiations
(including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish
any nonpublic information to, any Person or Persons (but only after any such
Person enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with the Company
that contains provisions that in the

 



72  aggregate are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement may not provide for an exclusive
right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from
complying with this _Section 6.3_ (a " _Company Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ ")) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and their respective
Representatives and potential sources of financing, if the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Person or Persons have submitted
to the Company a Company Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal.

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt) (i) notify Parent of the receipt
by the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide Parent

Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of (A) any
determination by the Companys board of directors that a Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Superior Proposal or (B) any decision of its board of directors as to whether
to participate in discussions or negotiations or furnish non-public
information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person in
response to a Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be given as
promptly as practicable after such determination was reached or decision was
made (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after such
determination was reached or decision was made). The Company will (I) keep
Parent informed as promptly as practicable with respect to any changes to the
material terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal submitted to the Company (and
in any event within forty-eight (48) hours following any such changes),
including by providing a copy of all written proposals relating to any
Company Acquisition Proposal and (II) promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) following the provision of any non-public information
of the Company to any such Person, provide such information to Parent
(including by posting such information to an electronic data room), to the
extent such information has not previously been provided or made available to
Parent.

or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt, or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (C) solely if
a Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced, fail to issue a
press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days following a written request to do so by Parent or (D) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action
described in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) being referred to as a " _Company
Change of Recommendation_ "); or

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar agreement (A)
constituting or relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in each case other than a
Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. 

 



73 (e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(d)_, prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under
applicable Law (i) in the case of a Company Intervening Event, make a Company
Change of Recommendation or (ii) with respect to a Company Superior Proposal,
which Company Superior Proposal did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 6.3_ by the Company or its Representatives, make a Company Change of
Recommendation, approve or recommend a Company Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, and enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that:

 

(i) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days in
advance of taking such action (such period, the " _Company Notice Period_ ")
that the Company intends to take such action, which notice must specify the
reasons for taking such action and, in the event of a Company Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal (including the
identity of the Person making the proposal) and concurrently provides a copy
of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such
proposal (it being understood that in the event any of the material terms or
conditions of any such proposal are modified during the Company Notice Period,
the Company shall as promptly as possible, and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such modification, notify Parent of
such modification, at which time a new Company Notice Period shall commence),
and in the event of a Company Intervening Event, a reasonable description of
such Company Intervening Event;

 

(ii) prior to taking such action, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Company Notice Period negotiate with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner
that would obviate the need for the Company to take such action; and

 

(iii) Parent shall not have proposed in writing at or prior to the conclusion
of the Company Notice Period any modifications or revisions to the terms of
this Agreement, which modifications or revisions ( _provided_ the Company has
received a definitive agreement in respect of the Company Superior Proposal
that would, upon the Companys acceptance, be binding on the parties

 



74  thereto) shall be evidenced by an offer to amend this Agreement that would,
upon the Companys acceptance, be binding on the parties hereto, and, if
applicable, revisions to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt
Financing Agreements, to provide for terms which the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, (A) would cause the Company Superior Proposal
to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, if applicable, or (B) if
the proposed Company Change of Recommendation is in response to a Company
Intervening Event, that the failure to make a Company Change
of Recommendation would not reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under applicable Law.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Companys board of directors
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the board of directors
of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure referred to
in clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to a Company Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Company Change of Recommendation unless (A) the board
of directors of the Company expressly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure or (B) such disclosure is a "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _further_ , that
this _Section 6.3(f)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Companys board of
directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation or take any of the
actions referred to in _Section 6.3(e)_, except, in each case, to the extent
permitted by _Section 6.3(e)_.

 

Section 6.4 _Parent Board Recommendation; Parent Acquisition Proposals_. This
_Section 6.4_ shall be in effect only if the Parent Stockholder Approval is
required.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.4_, Parent will not, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
employees not to, and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Parents and its Subsidiaries respective other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, seek or knowingly take any
action to facilitate or encourage, any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries or
discussions with any Third Parties with respect to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) in connection with any actual or potential Parent Acquisition
Proposal, disclose or furnish any nonpublic information or data to any Third
Party concerning Parents or its Subsidiaries business or properties or
afford any Third Party access to its or its Subsidiaries properties, books,
or records, (iv) enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute,
any agreement relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (v) accept,
approve, endorse, recommend or make or authorize any public statement,
recommendation, or solicitation in support of, or submit to
Parents stockholders any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and employees
to, and Parent will use its

 



75  reasonable best efforts to cause Parents and its Subsidiaries respective
other Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all
discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, and shall request that all
confidential or proprietary information previously furnished to any Third
Parties in connection with such discussions and negotiations be promptly
returned or destroyed. Parent acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any
officer, director or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries takes any
action that if taken by Parent would be a breach of this _Section 6.4_, the
taking of such action by such officer, director or employee shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 6.4_) by
the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that, prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent
receives a _bona fide_ unsolicited written Parent Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a material breach of this _Section 6.4_, Parent, its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives may, prior to the Parent Stockholder
Approval, participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Person or Persons (but only after any such Person enters
into a customary confidentiality agreement with Parent that contains
provisions that in the aggregate are no less favorable to Parent than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement may not provide
for an exclusive right to negotiate with Parent and may not restrict Parent
from complying with this _Section 6.4_ (a " _Parent Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ")) making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and
their respective Representatives and potential sources of financing, if
Parents board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Person or Persons

reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal.

(c) Parent will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt) (i) notify the Company of the

to participate in discussions or negotiations or furnish non-public
information with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries to any Person in
response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be given as

including by providing a copy of all written proposals relating to any
Parent Acquisition Proposal and (II) promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) following the provision of any non-public information
of Parent to any such Person, provide such information to the Company
(including by posting such information to an electronic data room), to the
extent such information has not previously been provided or made available to
the Company.

 



76 (d) Subject to _Section 6.4(e)_ and _Section 6.4(f)_, unless and until
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, neither

indirectly:

 

(i) (A) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify
or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board
Recommendation, (B) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt, or recommend, any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (C) solely if a

press release reaffirming the Parent Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days following a written request to do so by the Company or (D)
unless the Unis Closing Date has occurred prior to Parent Stockholder
Meeting, fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) being referred
to as a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ "); or

 

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
allow Parent to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar agreement (A)
constituting or relating to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring
Parent to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in each case other than a Parent
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.4(d)_, prior to the Parent Stockholder
Approval, Parents board of directors may, if Parents board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Parents directors under applicable
Law (i) in the case of a Parent Intervening Event, make a Parent Change of
Recommendation or (ii) with respect to a Parent Superior Proposal, which
Parent Superior Proposal did not result from a material breach of this 
_Section 6.4_ by Parent or its Representatives, make a Parent Change of
Recommendation, approve or recommend a Parent Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, and enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Parent Superior Proposal
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that:

 

(i) Parent notifies the Company in writing at least four (4) Business Days in
advance of taking such action (such period, the " _Parent Notice Period_ ")
that Parent intends to take such action, which notice must specify the reasons
for taking such action and, in the event of a Parent Superior Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such proposal (including the identity of the
Person making the proposal) and concurrently provides a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such proposal (it being

 



77  understood that in the event any of the material terms or conditions of any
such proposal are modified during the Parent Notice Period, Parent shall as
promptly as possible, and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt of such modification, notify the Company of such modification,
at which time a new Parent Notice Period shall commence), and in the event of
a Parent Intervening Event, a reasonable description of such Parent
Intervening Event;

(ii) prior to taking such action, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Parent Notice Period negotiate with the Company
in good faith (to the extent the Company desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner
that would obviate the need for Parent to take such action; and

(iii) the Company shall not have proposed in writing at or prior to the
conclusion of the Parent Notice Period any modifications or revisions to the
terms of this Agreement, which modifications or revisions ( _provided_ Parent
has received a definitive agreement in respect of the Parent Superior
Proposal that would, upon Parents acceptance, be binding on the parties
thereto) shall be evidenced by an offer to amend this Agreement that would,
upon Parents acceptance, be binding on the parties hereto, to provide for
terms which the board of directors of Parent determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, (A) would
cause the Parent Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal, if applicable, or (B) if the proposed Parent Change of
Recommendation is in response to a Parent Intervening Event, that the failure
to make a Parent Change of Recommendation would not reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Parents directors under
applicable Law.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parents board of directors from
(i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of Parent that the board of directors of
Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure referred to in clauses (i)
or (ii) that relates to a Parent Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Parent Change of Recommendation unless (A) the board of directors of Parent
expressly reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation in such disclosure or (B)
such disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders
of Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 6.4(f)_ shall not be deemed to
permit Parents board of directors to make a Parent Change of Recommendation
or take any of the actions referred to in _Section 6.4(e)_, except, in each
case, to the extent permitted by _Section 6.4(e)_.

 



78 Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries employed
as of the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ "), for a period of twelve (12)
months following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during an Employees
period of employment) and subject to the applicable Law of each jurisdiction
where such Employee is located, Parent agrees to provide or cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide each Employee
compensation and benefits (exclusive of equity incentive compensation) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the salary and benefits in
effect for the Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted
as conferring, or intending to confer, on any Employee a right to continued
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates or
continued receipt of any specific employee benefit.

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans.

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and accrual of benefits (solely, with respect to accrual,
for purposes of determining vacation and severance benefits), service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent
and its Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall waive eligibility
waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable Parent Plan and
waived or not included under the corresponding Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit
Plan. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to give or cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to give the Employees
credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the
Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
under a corresponding Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Parent Plan to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the applicable Parent Plan and subject to the approval of the relevant insurer
(but not including with respect to exclusions, maximums or waiting periods
that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or those under insured
plans that shall not be credited, waived or otherwise applicable by the
respective insurer).

 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.5_ with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in
any Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Parent Plans or (ii) to continued
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
6.5_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan or

 



79  Foreign Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plans of the Company, any
Subsidiary or the Company or Parent or prohibits Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan.

(e) With respect to the annual cash incentive awards for fiscal year 2016,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay out such awards
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice based upon
actual performance and prorated through the Closing Date; _provided_ , that in
the event an Employees employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation
other than for grounds constituting "cause", as defined in _Section
6.1(b)(xvii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, such bonus shall be paid
no later than thirty (30) days following such termination.

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to
Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of
their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make
any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior review and approval of the
other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement;
_provided_ that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior
approval of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release
or public announcement if the Companys board of directors has effected a
Company Change of Recommendation or in connection with any such press release
or public announcement pursuant to _Section 6.3(f)_; _provided_ ,  _further_
, that Parent will no longer be required to obtain the prior approval of or
consult with the Company in connection with any such press release or public
announcement if Parents board of directors has effected a Parent Change
of Recommendation or in connection with any such press release or public
announcement pursuant to _Section 6.4(f)_.

 

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any
of their respective present or former Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in
connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and by the bylaws of the Company and the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and the bylaws of the Company and the

to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all rights to exculpation
or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time existing as of the Effective Time in favor of directors and officers of
the Company, its

 



80  Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors in their capacity as officers or
directors and the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators
of such officer or director (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as provided in
the Companys or the applicable Subsidiaries respective certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
or in any agreement between such DandO Indemnitee, on one hand, and the Company
or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in effect as of the date hereof. After
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor their respective
obligations under this _Section 6.7(a)_.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not, and Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving Corporation to,
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
reasonably available, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies, or (ii) Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the DandO Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier,
that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best coverage
reasonably available; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
reasonably available, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



81 (c) This _Section 6.7_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the
DandO Indemnitees, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective

necessary to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms
thereof (including, as necessary, any "market flex" provisions related
thereto). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing:

 

(a) Parent shall not permit any amendment, supplement, replacement or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt
Commitment Letter without the consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such amendment, supplement,
replacement, modification or waiver (i) reduces (or could reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid) or original
issue discount (unless (A) the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or (B) the Company, Parent or Merger Sub have a corresponding amount
of available cash on hand (including from the issuance of any equity or equity
linked security) such that the representation set forth in _Section 5.10_
will still be true and correct) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions
to the initial funding or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends
or modifies any other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay (taking into account the
Marketing Period) or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the
Closing Date or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, in each case, relating to the
funding thereunder ( _provided_ , that Parent may (1) amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities and (2) implement or exercise the
"flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters related to the Debt

copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of
this _Section 6.18(a)_, references to "Debt

 



89  Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section 6.18(a)_ and
references to "Debt Financing" or "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section 6.18(a)_.

 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter except to the extent (x) there is a reduction of
commitments in respect of the Debt Financing in an amount equal to the gross
cash proceeds received by Parent or any of its domestic subsidiaries from the
issuance of debt securities or incurrence of loans in accordance with
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and (y) any of the commitments under
the Debt Commitment Letter are replaced with definitive Debt Financing
Agreements (any such commitment reduction, a " _Permitted Debt Commitment
Letter Reduction_ "), (ii) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_
") on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including, as necessary, any "market flex" provisions related
thereto), (iii) to satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the
waiver of) on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) all conditions to receipt of the amount of the Debt
Financing necessary to pay the aggregate amount of the aggregate Cash
Consideration at the Closing that are within its control (but excluding any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the
Companys failure to furnish information as required under Section _6.19_ or
the Companys breach of any of its other obligations under Section _6.19_ )
and, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iv) to
enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, including to cause the
Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing and (v) to
comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter. In each case
promptly upon the Companys request, Parent shall keep the Company informed in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and promptly provide to the Company at its request copies of all
substantially final drafts and executed definitive agreements for the Debt
Financing.

 

(c) Parent agrees to notify the Company reasonably promptly, and in any event
within three (3) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i)
the Debt Commitment Letter is terminated for any reason, (ii) Parent becomes
aware of any breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
any Debt Financing Agreement, (iii) a counterparty indicates in writing that
it will not provide, or it refuses to provide, all or any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) Parent receives any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any actual breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter
or any Debt Financing Agreement or (v) Parent determines in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary
to pay the aggregate Alternate Cash Consideration or Base Cash Consideration,
as applicable; provided, that in no event will Parent be under any obligation
to disclose any information shared among Parent and its professional advisors
in connection with matters contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iv) that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a
manner that would not waive such privilege. Without limiting Parents other
obligations under this _Section 6.18_, if the commitments with respect to all
or any portion of the Debt

 



90  Financing expire or are terminated (other than as a result of a Permitted
Debt Commitment Letter Reduction) or all or any portion of the Debt Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable, then Parent shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of such event and the reasons therefor, (ii) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative financing
sources in an amount sufficient to pay all amounts required to paid in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the " _Alternative Debt
Financing_ "), and (iii) obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with
a true, correct and complete copy of each alternative financing commitment in
respect of such Alternative Debt Financing (each, a " _New Debt Commitment
Letter_ "), together with all related fee letters (solely in the case of the
fee letters, with only (A) the fee amounts, yield or interest rate caps, and
original issue discount amounts and (B) "flex", "securities" demand terms,
other economic terms and other commercially sensitive terms, in each case
under this clause (B) that are confidential and do not adversely affect the
enforceability, availability or conditionality of or the aggregate amount of
net proceeds available under such financing, contained therein redacted). In
the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause
(ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter which is not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and each
New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (iii) any
reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee
letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that is not superseded by any
New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and each New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent may
substitute the net cash proceeds received by Parent after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing from consummated debt offerings or other incurrences of
debt (including unsecured notes) for all or any portion of the Debt Financing
by reducing commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that
(i) to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or mandatory
redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date, the termination of this Agreement or the Termination Date as applicable
(as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 8.1(b)(i)_), (ii) such
offering or other incurrence of debt does not result in a breach or default
under, or violation of, the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent it remains
in effect following such substitution), (iii) the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing committed under the Debt Commitment Letter following such
reduction, together with other cash and cash equivalents available to Parent,
is sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the proceeds of such
debt offerings or other incurrences have been received by Parent or a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent in cash (any such debt financing which satisfies
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Replacement Debt_ ").
Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such substitution and reduction
and promptly provide to the Company true, correct and complete copies of each
amendment or modification to the Debt Commitment Letter relating thereto and
the definitive documentation in respect of such consummated debt offering or
other incurrences of debt (provided that solely in the case of any fee
letters, (A) the fee amounts, yield or interest rate caps, and original issue
discount amounts and (B) "flex", "securities" demand terms, other economic
terms and other commercially sensitive terms, in each case under this clause
(B) that are 

 



91  confidential and do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or
conditionality of or the aggregate amount of net proceeds available under such
financing, contained therein may be redacted). Further, Parent may substitute
commitments in respect of other debt financing for all or any portion of the
Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide Third Party
financing sources so long as (i) all conditions precedent to effectiveness of
definitive documentation for such debt financing have been satisfied and the
conditions precedent to funding of such debt financing are no less favorable
to the Company than the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5 of and
Annex V to the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) such substitution would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of
the Debt Financing or such other debt financing on the Closing Date,
and (iii) prior to funding of any loans thereunder, the commitments in
respect of such debt financing are subject to restrictions on assignment that
are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the
Company than the corresponding restrictions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (any such debt financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), the " _Replacement Commitments_ ", and together with any
Replacement Debt, the " _Replacement Financing_ "; the definitive
documentation for any such Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing
Documents_ " and any commitment letter in respect of any such Replacement
Financing, the " _Replacement Financing Commitment Letter_ "); provided that
(A) such Replacement Financing does not result in a breach or default under,
or violation of, the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent it remains in
effect following such substitution), (B) the aggregate amount of the debt
financing committed under the Debt Commitment Letter following such
substitution and committed under any Replacement Financing Commitment Letter,
together with other cash and cash equivalents available to Parent, is
sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall promptly provide the
Company true, correct and complete copies of each such amendment or
modification to the Debt Commitment Letter relating thereto and the
Replacement Financing Documents and any Replacement Financing Commitment
Letter (and drafts thereof shall be made available to the Company prior to any
such substitution) (provided that solely in the case of any fee letters, (x)
the fee amounts, yield or interest rate caps, and original issue discount
amounts and (y) "flex", "securities" demand terms, other economic terms and
other commercially sensitive terms, in each case under this clause (y) that
are confidential and do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability
or conditionality of or the aggregate amount of net proceeds available under
such financing, contained therein may be redacted). In the event Replacement
Financing is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing" shall include the Replacement Debt and any debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause
(ii) below, as applicable, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter which
is not superseded by a Replacement Financing Commitment Letter at the time in
question and each Replacement Financing Commitment Letter to the extent then
in effect, and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be
deemed to include any fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that
is not superseded by any Replacement Financing Commitment Letter at the time
in question and each Replacement Financing Commitment Letter to the extent
then in effect.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parents
obligations under this Agreement are not subject to a condition regarding
Parents or any of its Affiliates obtaining funds to consummate the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this

 



92  Agreement, including any payments (if any) required to be made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any holder of the
convertible senior notes issued under the Company Indentures in accordance
with the terms of the Company Indentures.

agreement between the Company and Parent (or its Affiliates), the Company
agrees that Parent and its Affiliates may share customary projections with
respect to the Company and its business with the Financing Sources, and that
Parent, its Affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such information
with potential Financing Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in
connection with the Debt Financing, provided that the recipients of such
information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements and
acknowledgments from such recipients of their receipt of material non-public
information in compliance with applicable procedures and laws.

 

Section 6.20 _CFIUS Approval_. If the Unis Investment is a "covered
transaction" for CFIUS purposes and has not been terminated, each of the

include (a) engaging in prefiling discussions with CFIUS or its member
agencies, (b) promptly making any draft and final filings required in
connection with the

 



95  CFIUS Approval in accordance with the DPA and (c) providing any information
reasonably requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S.
government in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Unis Investment is not a
"covered transaction" for CFIUS purposes, but CFIUS requests or requires a
filing with respect to the Merger contemplated by this Agreement, then each
of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval.

 

Section 6.21 _Title Cooperation_. Parent, at its own discretion and sole
expense, may, for its own behalf or as required by any Financing Source,

Section 6.22 _Company Indentures._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Merger and the
consummation thereof, and (ii) Parent shall, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the Merger and the consummation
thereof, each assist in the preparation of, and shall execute and deliver, any
supplemental indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or other
documents or instruments required in connection with the Merger and the
consummation thereof, including one or more supplemental indentures, to be
executed and delivered to the applicable Trustee (as defined in the
applicable Company Indenture) under the applicable Company Indenture at or
prior to the Effective Time and satisfactory in form and substance to such
Trustee, to each Company Indenture to provide, among other things, that on
and after the Effective Time, each holder of the convertible senior notes
issued thereunder shall have the right to convert such convertible senior
notes into the conversion consideration determined by reference to the
Merger Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of
the applicable Company Indenture governing conversion of the convertible
senior notes issued thereunder (including any applicable increase in the
Conversion Rate (as defined in the applicable Company Indenture) thereunder
in connection with the Merger).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
may be required in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the
applicable Company Indenture or under applicable Law, including the giving of
any notices that may be required in connection with the Merger and any
repurchases or conversions of the convertible senior notes issued under the
applicable Company Indenture occurring as a result of or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constituting a Fundamental
Change. In addition, following the occurrence of any event that would require
an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under any Company Indenture (including
any adjustment that would require a change to such Conversion Rate of less
than 1%), the Company shall promptly provide Parent an updated _Section
4.20_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately setting out (i) the
Conversion Rate for each Company Indenture and (ii) the table from each
Company Indenture specifying the number of Additional Shares (as defined in
the applicable Company Indenture) by which such Conversion Rate will be
increased upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the
applicable Company Indenture), in each case, as adjusted to reflect all events
that have occurred through the date on which such update is provided that
would result in an adjustment

 



96  pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Indenture (including any
adjustments that would require a change of less than 1% of the Conversion
Rate). For the avoidance of doubt, the updated tables shall only include the
effective dates from (and including) the effective date immediately preceding
the date on which such update is provided.

 

(c) The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any notices, certificates, press releases, supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or
instruments deliverable pursuant to or in connection with any Company
Indentures prior to the dispatch or making thereof, and the Company
shall promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and reflect any
reasonable comments made by, Parent or its counsel with respect thereto prior
to the dispatch or making thereof.

 

(d) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the
event that Parent desires to consummate a repurchase offer or similar
transaction with respect to any or all of the senior convertible notes issued
under the Company Indentures (any such transaction, a " _Repurchase
Transaction_ "), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives (and, in the case of the Company, the
applicable Trustee under the applicable Company Indenture) to, cooperate with
one another in good faith to permit such Repurchase Transaction to be
effected on such terms, conditions and timing as reasonably requested by
Parent, including if so requested by Parent, causing such Repurchase
Transaction to be consummated substantially concurrently with, but not prior
to, the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of any
Repurchase Transaction shall not be a condition to Closing. In addition,
Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
employees, partners, members, directors and Affiliates, and each Person, if
any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, and any dealer-manager, information agent, solicitation agent,
depositary or other agent or Person engaged by or on behalf of Parent or the
Company (and such Persons officers, employees, partners, members, directors
and Affiliates and each other Person, if any, who controls such Person within
the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act) at the request of Parent in
connection with any Repurchase Transaction if applicable, for and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with any Repurchase Transactions, and promptly reimburse such Persons for any
documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any Repurchase Transaction.

(e) Capitalized terms in this _Section 6.22_ that are not otherwise defined
in this Agreement have the meaning given them in the applicable Company
Indenture. The obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this
_Section 6.22_ shall be subject to the limitations and qualifications in
_Section 6.19(c)_ (other than clauses (C) and (F) thereof) to the same
extent as such _Section 6.19(c)_ applies to the obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Debt Financing.

to the extent such Affiliate or other Person expressly represents the

Company Warrants or is empowered to make any determinations, adjustments or

with respect to any determination, adjustment or computation under, or
in connection with any discussions or negotiations related to, the Company
Bond Hedge Transactions or Company Warrants. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Representatives not to, enter into any agreements in respect of the
Company Bond Hedge Transactions or Company Warrants or make any cash payments
or share deliveries with respect to the Company Bond Hedge Transactions or
Company Warrants without Parents prior written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall keep Parent fully informed of
all such discussions and negotiations and shall give Parent the option to
participate (or have its counsel participate) in any such discussions and
negotiations. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any written response to any written
notice or other document received from any Bond Hedge Counterparty with
respect to any determination, adjustment or computation under, or in
connection with any discussions or negotiations related to, the Company Bond
Hedge Transactions or Company Warrants prior to making any such response, and
the Company shall promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and

the Company Warrants, including the giving of any written notices or
communication that may be required in connection with the Merger and/or any
conversions of the convertible senior notes issued under the applicable
Company Indentures or any adjustment to the respective Conversion Rates

contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such written
notice or communication prior to the dispatch or making thereof, and the

Subsidiaries with respect to the Debt Financing.

joint transition teams, and shall cause such Persons to devote time to
joint transition matters, including weekly meetings to discuss planning and
implementation of a joint transition plan in accordance with this _Section
6.24_; _provided_ , that such transition matters shall not unreasonably
interfere with the performance of such Persons ordinary course professional
responsibilities.

reasonably request), (b) give Parent the opportunity and right to participate
in the defense of any such shareholder litigation at Parents sole cost and
expense, including in any and all proceedings related to any such shareholder

as of the time of such termination all conditions to Closing have been
satisfied other than the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_
