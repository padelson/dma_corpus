Sub expressly agree not to raise as a defense or objection to the request or granting of the relief of specific performance that any breach of this Agreement is or would be compensable by an award of money damages or remedied at law or in equity by
another means. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;11.12 <I>Jurisdiction</I>. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
