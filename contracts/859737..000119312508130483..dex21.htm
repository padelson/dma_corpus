(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Merger Sub to

Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this

Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (A) the date this Agreement is terminated

date hereof (the " _Outside Date_ "); and _provided further_ , that the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section_ _2.1(d)_ shall not be deemed
to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ hereof, and (iii) Merger
Sub may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any
other Person), elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or
more extensions thereof) in accordance with _Section 2.1(f)_. Merger Sub

Act and all other provisions of applicable securities laws of not less than
three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) immediately following the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event that more than fifty percent (50%) but less than ninety percent
(90%) of the then outstanding Shares have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on the applicable Expiration Date, Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of ten (10) business days

under the Exchange Act) immediately following the Expiration Date. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay
for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so

resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to

of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company) and electing Parents designees
to the vacancies created by such resignations, _provided_ that with respect to
the Board of Directors of TWT Japan, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors as shall be equal to the product of the
(A) the Director Percentage and (B) the total number of directors the Company

constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate)
as is on the Board of Directors (or the board of directors or similar
governing body of each Subsidiary of the Company) on each committee of the
Board of Directors (and each committee of the board of directors or similar
governing body of each Subsidiary of the Company) to the fullest extent
permitted by all applicable Laws and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select
Market. Solely for purposes of this _Section 2.3_, any and all members of
the Board of Directors immediately prior to such appointments by Parent who
remain on the Board of Directors after such appointments by Parent shall be
referred to as " _Continuing Directors_."

appointed to the Board of Directors pursuant to  _Section 2.3(a)_, until the

directors as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market
or the federal securities laws who  



 

14  are considered independent directors within the meaning of such rules and
laws (" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided that_ , in such event, if the

Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such

the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and there shall be any Continuing
Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the
sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director)
shall be required in order to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree
or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, in any case
on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive,
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv)
amend, rescind, repeal or waive the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company , or (v) make any other determination with respect to any action
to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger.

Section 2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) _Grant and Availability of Top-Up Option_. The Company hereby grants to
Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to
purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a number of Shares
(the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Shares
owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes 90.0005%
of the number of Shares that will be outstanding immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by
Parent or Merger Sub at any time on or after the Acceptance Time and on or
prior to the fifth Business Day after the later of (1) the expiration date of
the Offer or (2) the expiration of any subsequent offering period; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option
Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions,
unless waived by the Company, that (A) no provision of any applicable Laws and
no applicable order, injunction or other judgment shall prohibit the exercise
of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of
such exercise, (B) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up
Option would not require approval of the Companys stockholders under
applicable Laws (including, for this purpose the rules and regulations of the
Nasdaq Global Select Market), (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent or Merger Sub constitutes 90.0005% of the number of Shares that will
be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares,  



 

15  and (D) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares
of common stock of the Company less the maximum number of shares potentially
necessary for issuance with respect to all outstanding Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Warrants, the Convertible Notes or
other obligations of the Company. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all
applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. Parent and
Merger Sub shall have the right, but shall not be required to, exercise the
Top-Up Option in its sole discretion and may only exercise the Top-Up Option
if following its exercise, the condition set forth in clause (C) would be
satisfied.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in
accordance with  _Section 2.4(a)_, Parent shall so notify the Company and
shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that are expected to
be owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and
(ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub of the number of Shares then outstanding
and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall pay the
Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares,
and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate
purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid by Merger Sub
or Parent in cash or by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory
note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase
price for the Top-Up Shares, or some combination thereof. Any such promissory
note shall bear interest at a rate of interest per annum equal to 3%, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. In the event
that Merger Sub becomes the owner of 90.0005% or more of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, Parent shall promptly cause Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

(c) _Accredited Investor Status_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Shares which Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will
not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon
an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is,
or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Options Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

16 Section 3.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger or certificate of
ownership and merger, as applicable (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the
effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

Section 3.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,

restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving

Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL

STOCK

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to
this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of the Shares:

(a) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(the " _Common Stock_ " or the " _Shares_ ") held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned directly or indirectly by Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise) shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be
made or delivered with respect thereto.

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
4.1(a)_), automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, without interest thereon
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender
of the stock certificate formerly representing such Share (a " _Certificate_
") in the manner provided in _Section 4.2_. Such Shares, other than those
canceled pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_, sometimes are referred to herein as
the " _Merger Shares_."



 

17 (d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of
outstanding Shares is changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger
Consideration payable per Merger Share shall be correspondingly adjusted.

Section 4.2 _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) designate a bank or trust
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_
") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such Paying Agent, to serve as
the Paying Agent for the Merger Consideration. Prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
Parent will deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Pending
distribution of the cash deposited with the Paying Agent, such cash shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not be used for any other
purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may direct the Paying Agent to
invest such cash in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreement or bankers acceptances of,
or demand deposits with, commercial banks having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are publicly available), or (iii) commercial
paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and Poors Corporation
or Moodys Investor Services, Inc. Any profit or loss resulting from, or
interest and other income produced by, such investments shall be for the
account of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later
than two Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall send, or cause the
Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of Merger Shares entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for
exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration payable therefor.
The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will specify
that delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of Certificate or Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent together
with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any
other documentation that the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in exchange therefor. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and
exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate
in respect thereof.

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any applicable
stock transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares that
occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article IV_.



 

18 (e) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent remains unclaimed nine months
after the Effective Time, such cash and any interest accrued thereon shall be
returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not
surrendered such holders Certificates for the Merger Consideration prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Merger
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to such
time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate.

(g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

(h) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting
by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the proper amount of the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder and any amounts to be paid hereunder in respect of Company Options
or Company Restricted Stock Units any amounts required to be deducted and
withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the applicable Tax
authority and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
holder from whose Merger Consideration (or amounts payable hereunder with
respect to Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Units) the amounts
were so deducted and withheld.

Section 4.3 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock Units and Other Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) and unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent
and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option or
restricted stock unit, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent
Common Stock and which has other terms and conditions substantially identical
to those of the related Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit, as
the case may be (including any accelerated vesting provisions therein), except
that (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
award shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit,
as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the
"Award Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the Offer Price and the
denominator of which is the Parent Closing Value (and rounding such amount up
to the nearest share if .5 or above and down to the nearest share if below .5)
and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per share of Parent
Common Stock shall equal (x) the per share exercise price or purchase price
for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit, as applicable, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio (with
such quotient rounded up to the nearest whole cent); provided, however, that
if the exchange of a Company Option for a Parent Stock Option is not in
compliance with the adjustment requirements of Section 409A of the Code then
it shall be  



 

19  cancelled in exchange for a payment equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the
product of (I) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (II)
the Offer Price over (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option,
without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Law. The assumption and adjustment of the Company Options
and Company Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, in accordance with this
Section 4.3(a) shall preserve the compensation element of each Company Option
or Company Restricted Stock Unit, as applicable, as of the Effective Time.

(b) Each assumed Company Option shall be deemed vested immediately following
the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of
shares subject thereto as it was vested immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except with respect to any Company Option or Company Restricted Stock
Unit governed by any of the agreements set forth on Schedule 4.3 of the
Company Disclosure Letter which provide for acceleration of vesting by reason
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each assumed Company Option and
Company Restricted Stock Unit will otherwise continue to have, and be subject
to, substantially identical terms and conditions as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options
or Company Restricted Stock Units or in connection with any other Company
Incentive Plans for which shares of Parent Common Stock are required to be
reserved for issuance. No later than 3 Business Days after the Effective Date,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the
case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such options, restricted stock units
or Company Incentive Plans for which registration of shares of Parent Common
Stock is required and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options or restricted stock units remain
outstanding or for so long as such registration statement is required with
respect to any other Company Incentive Plans. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each
holder of any Company Option or unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Company
Option or unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit, as applicable. The parties
agree to apply the Next day rule of Treasury Regulation Sec.
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to the Companys stock option deduction
for tax purposes.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each then outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Unit that (i) has become vested on or before the Closing by
its written terms as set forth in the relevant award agreement as in effect on
the date hereof (or as the same may be modified by any Employment Agreement
between the recipient and the Company in effect on the date hereof) and (ii)
has not been settled as of the Closing Date shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each such
vested Company Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to be outstanding and shall
be canceled, and any award agreement (or portion thereof) evidencing the grant
of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Company
Restricted Stock Units formerly represented thereby.

(d) On the Revised Exercise Date, all amounts withheld by the Company on
behalf of the participants in the Companys 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "Stock Purchase Plan") from the beginning of the applicable existing
salary reduction periods through the Revised Exercise Date will be deemed to
have been used to purchase Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Stock
Purchase Plan, using the Revised Exercise Date as the last date of the salary
reduction period under the Stock Purchase Plan, unless prior to the Revised
Exercise Date the participant in question has withdrawn from the offering
period pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase Plan. As of the
Effective Time, each such share of Common Stock will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 4.1. On or after the date of this Agreement, in no event (x) shall any
person who is not currently participating in the Stock Purchase Plan be
permitted to begin participating in the Stock Purchase Plan, and (y) shall any
person who is currently participating in the Stock Purchase Plan be permitted
to increase the level of salary reduction amount that may otherwise be deemed
 



 

20  used to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Stock Purchase Plan from
that level of salary reduction amount in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that in no event may any new offering
period commence after the date hereof and prior to the Revised Exercise Date.

Section 4.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands, exercises, and perfects his or
her demand for appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost; such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting
Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and shall
be entitled to receive consideration thereunder. If any such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of
such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only
for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time
that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 4.1(c). The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

Section 4.5 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Parent, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Parent, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Offer or the Merger.

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company concurrently with
entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any
other section or subsection to which the relevance of such disclosure is
readily apparent) or as may be disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed on
or after December 31, 2006 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding
only matters disclosed in "risk factors" or the "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

Section 5.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize the concept of good standing) except in the case of
the Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing
and in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all corporate or
similar powers and authority required to own, lease and operate its respective
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except in the case
of the Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to have such power and
authority has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified has not had, and would not  



 

21  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries is
in violation of its organizational or governing documents in any material
respect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent and Merger Sub
true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as currently in effect.

Section 5.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

(a) The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock if required pursuant to the DGCL or the rules of the Nasdaq
Global Select Market (the " _Requisite Stockholder Vote_ "), to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to perform each of
its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company. Except for the
adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote if required
pursuant to the DGCL, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Offer,

meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
and (iii) subject to the provisions of _Section 8.6_, resolved to recommend

directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the stockholders
of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due and valid execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and general equitable principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 

Section 5.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Offer and the Merger do not and will not require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification

Merger; (ii) compliance with the applicable requirements of any Regulatory
Law; (iii) the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act including the
filing of the Schedule 14D-9 and the Company Proxy Statement; (iv) compliance
with the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market; (v)
compliance with any applicable state securities or blue sky laws; and (vi) any
such consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or notification
the failure of which to make or obtain would not (A) individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (B) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

Section 5.4 _Non-Contravention_. Except as set forth in Section 5.4 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of, the organizational or governing documents of (A) the Company or
(B) any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming compliance with the matters
referenced in Section 5.3 and the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Vote,
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
Law binding upon or applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets; or (iii) require the consent,
approval or authorization of, or notice to or filing with any third party with
respect to, or result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) or result in the loss of benefit under, or give rise to  



 

22  any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any
right or obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in
the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any loan

(f) Subject to the obligations under _Section 8.4(d)_, in the event that any
administrative or judicial Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the

Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Representatives to provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable

of the Company and such Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company) as Parent or Merger
Sub reasonably may request, and (ii) all documents that Merger Sub reasonably
may request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.5_,

46 Section 8.6 _Non-Solicitation and Recommendation Withdrawal_.

(a) Subject to the remainder of this _Section 8.6_, until the Acceptance Time
or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
X_ , the Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall direct its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents,
advisors, affiliates and other representatives (" _Representatives_ ") not
to: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist
(including by way of providing information), the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or engage
in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish non-public information
relating to the Company to, or otherwise cooperate with, any Person other
than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents, advisors,
affiliates and other representatives (any such other Person, a " _Third

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 8.6(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a Company Acquisition Proposal
that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
_Section 8.6_, from a Third Party that the Board of Directors of the
Company believes in good faith by majority vote or written consent to be
_bona fide_ and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith by majority vote or written consent (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
(as hereinafter defined), then the Company may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will
not allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to
such Person without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as
hereinafter defined), and (y) will promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously
provided to Parent, and provided further, that the Company will not take any
of the actions described in (A) or (B) above unless and until the Board of
Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote or written consent after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that
the failure to take that action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law.

(c) The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding subsection unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but
in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by any Representative of any
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and
in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the
status and details of any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request.

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal
(subject to the next following sentence in this _Section 8.6(d))_ or (ii)
approve any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, merger
agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to, or
that may reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, but not after, the
Acceptance Time, the  



 

47  Board of Directors may, (A) in response to a Superior Proposal, effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal and terminate this Agreement to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance
with Section 10.1(c)(ii), provided that the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, by majority vote or written consent after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law or (B) in response to a material development or change in
circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither
known to the Board of Directors nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to
the date hereof (and not relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
ruling or determination by the FDA) (such material development or change in
circumstances, an _"Intervening Event"_ ) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal
provided that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by majority vote
or written consent after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and
provided further that in either case the Board of Directors will not effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal, unless the Company (x) promptly notifies Parent, in
writing, at least three (3) Business Days before taking that action advising
Parent that the Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, (y) during such three (3) Business
Day period, if requested by Parent, engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a
Recommendation Withdrawal, and (z) in the case of Recommendation Withdrawal in
connection with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X,
complies with the provisions of _Section 10.3_. Any Recommendation
Withdrawal (other than a Recommendation Withdrawal in connection with a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X) shall not change the
approval of this Agreement, or any other approval of the Board of Directors of
the Company, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing
any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar
statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including the Offer and the Merger.

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal and shall request that any such Third Party (or its
agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the
Company or its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all such information.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosures to the Company Stockholders that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith by a majority vote or written consent (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) are required
to be made by the Board so as to not act in a manner inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Company Stockholders under applicable Law; provided,
however that neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by _Section 8.6(d)_ effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal.

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 8.6_ by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 8.6_ by the Company.

(h) As used in this Agreement, the term:

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions regarding confidentiality that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, as determined conclusively by the Board of
Directors of the Company, provided that  



 

48  such agreement shall not prohibit the Company from providing to Parent any
of the information required to be provided to Parent under this Section 8.6; 

(ii) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person or group of persons other than Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective affiliates relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of the assets of the Company relating to its HPV 14 type HR screening
and 16/18 genotyping tests, or of a business that constitutes 30% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or 30% or more of any class or series of Company Securities,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or group of Persons beneficially owning 30% or more of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company, or any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 30% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole); and

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written, bona fide, unsolicited Company
Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Companys Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of the Company, that
the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines by majority
vote or written consent, after consultation with its outside legal advisor
and financial advisor, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein and (y) after taking into account all appropriate legal (with the
advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any
such proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted by applicable Law, and (z) provided that the Third
Party making such Superior Proposal has either has cash on hand or a financing
commitment not materially more conditional than Parents in order to enable
it to consummate such Superior Proposal.

Section 8.7 _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the Company (and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), to the greatest extent
permitted by Law, to indemnify and hold harmless (and comply with all of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries existing obligations to advance funds for
expenses, subject to the receipt of an irrevocable undertaking by the
proposed indemnitee to repay any advanced amounts if it is ultimately
determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification) the
present and former officers and directors thereof against any and all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative ("
_Damages_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, the approval of this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out
of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii)
shall indemnify and hold harmless such persons against any and all Damages
arising out of acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an
officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any
indemnitee wishing to claim rights under this _Section 8.7(a)_ shall, upon
becoming aware of any proceeding, claim, action or investigation for
which indemnification may be sought hereunder, promptly notify Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in writing and shall provide Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with all information known to such indemnitee and copies of all
documents available to such indemnitee relating to such matter ( _provided_ ,
that failure to so notify shall not affect Parents or the Surviving
Corporations obligations under this _Section 8.7(a)_ except to the extent
such failure prejudices Parent or the Surviving Corporation). Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any matter covered by this _Section 8.7(a)_. No indemnitee shall enter into
or agree to any settlement or other consensual resolution of any matter
covered by this _Section 8.7_ without the prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)  



 

49  of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Parent shall cause the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any indemnified
party described in the preceding sentence in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 8.7_, as such fees are incurred upon
the written request of any such indemnified party (subject to the receipt of
an irrevocable undertaking by the proposed indemnitee to repay any advanced
amounts if it is ultimately determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification).

 

(b) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have caused
the Company to have purchased, and, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a tail policy to the current policy
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained on the date hereof
by the Company (the " _Current Policy_ "), which tail policy shall
be effective for a period from the Acceptance Time through and including the
date six years after the Acceptance Date with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Acceptance Time,
and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and
amount as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, in the
aggregate, than the coverage currently provided by the Current Policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend annually in excess of 275% of the current annual premium
paid by the Company under the Current Policy (the " _Insurance Amount_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the premium of such insurance coverage
exceeds the Insurance Amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain, and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Insurance Amount.

(c) This _Section 8.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
present or former directors or officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and
their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
successors and assigns. In the event that Parent causes the Company to do, or
the Surviving Corporation (or any of its successors or assigns) does, any of
the following: (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer or convey all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
assume and honor the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.7_. The
agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive
of any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 8.7_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
any such policies.

Section 8.8 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take
all action necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize
the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.9  _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any
Recommendation Withdrawal in accordance with _Section 8.6(d)_ or any action
taken pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 8.6_ or _Article X_ , so
long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties will consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. No party hereto or
any of its respective Affiliates or representatives will issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
to the extent the disclosing party determines it is required to do so by  



 

50  applicable Law or any listing agreement with a national stock exchange, in
which case that party will use all reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party before issuing any such release or making any such public
statement.

Section 8.10 _Notice of Current Events_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Acceptance Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied; or (ii) the receipt of any material
notice or other material communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) any
regulatory notice, report or result of inspection from the FDA or any similar
Governmental Authority received by the Company that would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the Company; or (iv) the failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 8.10_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.

Section 8.11 _Employee Matters_. 

(a) For a period of not less than one year following the Effective Date,
Parent shall provide all individuals who are employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Effective Date so long as they remain employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including employees who are not actively at work
on account of illness, disability or leave of absence) on the Effective
Date (taken as a whole, the " _Affected Employees_ "), with base salary and
employee benefits which are not materially less favorable in the aggregate
than the base salary and employee benefits provided generally to similarly
situated employees of Parent (excluding incentive compensation). Nothing
contained in this _Section 8.11_ shall be deemed to grant any Affected
Employee (i) any right to continued employment after the Acceptance Date or
the Effective Date or (ii) any right to any specific type or amount of, or
eligibility for, incentive compensation or benefit, which shall be provided
under Parent plans in which similarly situated employees of Parent
participate. Certain benefits earned by employees of the Company set forth on
_Schedule 8.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be dealt with in the
manner set forth thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent hereby expressly
assumes and agrees to perform the Companys obligations under the employment
agreements listed in _Section 8.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as
amended to date in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company
would be required to perform such obligations if the Offer and the Merger had
not taken place.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall give
any Affected Employees full credit for all purposes (but not benefit accruals
under any newly established defined benefit pension plans), under any new
employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Affected
Employees as of and after the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries for the Affected Employees service with the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Surviving
Corporation Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time under any similar Company Benefit Plan. With
respect to each Surviving Corporation Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, for the applicable plan year in
which the Closing occurs, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Affected Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.



 

51 (c) The provisions of this _Section 8.11_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to (i) confer upon or give to any person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employees or Affected
Employees), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 8.11_) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement, or (ii) constitute an amendment or
modification of any Company Benefit Plan.

Section 8.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Promptly following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will cause the Shares to be delisted from the Nasdaq
Global Select Market, deregistered under the Exchange Act and all registration
statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act shall be withdrawn.

Section 8.13 _Section 16(b)_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities with respect to equity securities of the Company) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is a director or executive officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 8.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any stockholder litigation brought,
or threatened, against the Company, its directors and/or its executive
officers and will cooperate with Parent in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether commenced prior to or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not
settle or offer to settle in exchange for the payment of funds any litigation
commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or
any of its directors or executive officers by any Company Stockholder relating
to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Section 8.15 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and Parent will
(a) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all
applications or other documents regarding any applicable exemptions to any
such Tax or fee and (c) each pay any such Tax or fee which becomes payable by

shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement. The obligations and liability of Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder shall be joint and several.

Section 8.17 _Parent Representatives_. Parent hereby designates the two
officers of Parent set forth on _Section 8.17_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedules, or such other officers as Parent may designate upon written notice
to the Company (the " _Parent Representatives_ "), to be responsible for
determining whether consent to any action prohibited by _Section 7.1_ shall
be given by Parent. The Parent Representatives shall respond promptly in
writing to any request for consent to the taking of any action under _Section
7.1_. The Company may rely on any consent or response given by any of the
Parent Representatives.

Section 8.18 _Company Warrants_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that each
holder of Company Warrants will have the right to specify in writing to the
Company prior to the fifth trading day prior to the Acceptance Date, the
amount, if any, of its Company Warrants that such holder will require the
Company to  



 

52  redeem. Following the public announcement of this Agreement, the Company
shall give notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to each
holder of the Company Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrants.
No less than five Business Days prior to the expiration date of the Offer, the
Company shall establish an escrow account with an independent escrow agent
(the _"Warrant Escrow Account"_ ) and provide Parent with the wiring
instructions related thereto. Parent shall deposit the Estimated Warrant
Consideration in the Warrant Escrow Account at least three Business Days prior
to the expiration date of the Offer. To the extent the Actual Warrant
Consideration is greater than the Estimated Warrant Consideration, on the
Acceptance Date, Parent shall deposit in the Warrant Escrow Account the amount
of such deficit. On the Acceptance Date, the escrow agent shall release the
Actual Warrant Consideration to the holders of the Company Warrants who have
elected redemption as provided in the Company Warrants. If the Actual Warrant
Consideration is less than the Estimated Warrant Consideration, the Escrow
Agent shall release such excess amount to Parent after payment of amounts due
to holders of Company Warrants.

Section 8.19 _Convertible Notes_. Following the public announcement of this
Agreement, the Company shall give notice of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to each holder of the Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms
of the Convertible Notes. Promptly after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
cause the Company to provide each holder of the Convertible Notes with written
notice providing that such holder has the opportunity to convert some or all
of its Convertible Notes into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to
the Change in Control Redemption Price (as defined in the Convertible Notes).
Parent shall cause the Company to deliver such change of control notice to
each holder of the Convertible Notes not less than 30 and not more than 60
days prior to the redemption date specified therein. Thereafter, Parent (or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall pay to each holder
that so elects in writing the Change in Control Redemption Price in the manner
provided in the Convertible Notes. To the extent a holder of a Convertible
Note does not elect to have its Convertible Note redeemed, such Convertible
Notes shall remain outstanding and, if any time after the Effective Time and

Section 8.21 _[RESERVED]_

Section 8.22 _Cooperation with Respect to Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable that are within Parents and Merger Subs control to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment and to satisfy on a timely basis all
the conditions to obtaining the  



 

53  Debt Financing set forth therein, (ii) enter into definitive financing
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing as contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), so that the
Financing Agreements are in effect at or prior to the Acceptance Time and
(iii) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Acceptance Time. Parent
and Merger Sub shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment Letter without first consulting with the Company, and will obtain
the Companys prior written consent prior to agreeing to any such amendment,
modification or waiver that would add additional material conditions to
funding or materially increase the likelihood that the conditions to funding
would not be satisfied. Promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof and in any
event within 24 hours thereof, Parent and Merger Sub will give the Company
notice of any breaches by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
termination of the Debt Commitment.

(b) If any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements expire or
are terminated prior to the Effective Time, in whole or in part, for
any reason, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such expiration or
termination.

(c) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, on a timely basis, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers, employees and
advisers to provide on a timely basis, all necessary cooperation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, or any alternative
financing Parent may seek in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to otherwise use its
commercially reasonably efforts to cooperate with Parent with respect to the
terms, covenants and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter that relate to
the Company, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
facilitate the pledge of collateral (effective as of the Effective Time), (ii)
provide to Parent the type of financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company that is typically included in presentations to rating
agencies or in a "bank book" used for syndicating loans similar in type and
size to the Debt Financing, so as to assist Parent in connection with Parents
submissions to rating agencies and Parents assistance to GSCP in preparation
of a "bank book" for syndication of the Debt Financing, all as contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter, and (iii) provide other reasonably requested
certificates or readily available documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall be deemed to require the Company to take any
extraordinary measures, create any extraordinary documents, pay any fees to,
or reimburse any expenses of, any third party in connection with
the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
or any alternative financing Parent may seek in order to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

hereto to be satisfied on or before the Outside Date; or (II) the withdrawal
of the Offer or expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with its
terms without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) having accepted

under this Agreement (including such partys obligations set forth in _Section

(c) by the Company:

(i) if a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
(other than the failure of Parent to accept and pay for the Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer in accordance with the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement as a result of a No Fault Financing Failure) shall
have occurred, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date
or is not cured by the earlier of (A) ten (10) Business Days following
written notice to Parent by the Company of such breach and (B) the Outside
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company is not then in material breach
of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section
C(1), Section C(2) or Section C(3) of _Annex A_ hereto, not to be satisfied
(it being understood that, if the Tender Offer conditions are satisfied and
Parent does not consummate the Offer other than as a result of a No Fault

(c));

Offer and this Agreement), (C) GSCP has not funded the Debt Financing under
its Debt Commitment, and (D) Parent has failed to accept and pay for the
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer in accordance with  



 

55  the terms of the Offer and this Agreement (the grounds for termination of
this Agreement set forth in this Section 10.1(c)(iv) being referred to
herein collectively as a " _No Fault Financing Failure_ "), provided however,
that the Company may not terminate the Agreement under Section 10.1(c)(i) or
(c)(iv) above if the sole reason that Parent does not obtain the Debt
Financing is the Companys failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide information contemplated by Section 8.22.

(d) by Parent or Merger Sub, if:

(i) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which
would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section C(1), Section C(2) or
Section C(3) of _Annex A_ hereto not to be satisfied, and such breach is
incapable of being cured by the Outside Date or is not cured by the earlier
of (A) ten (10) Business Days following written notice to the Company by

neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of this Agreement;

(ii) the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or their respective
Representatives shall have breached in any material respect their respective
obligations under _Section 8.6_; or

in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal made by way of a tender offer or
exchange offer, fail to recommend that the Company Stockholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) Business Day period
specified in Section 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or (C) fail to include
the Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit Parent and Merger Sub
to include the Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

Section 10.2 _Termination After Acceptance Time and Prior to Effective Time_.
This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time by either the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, if
there shall be any final and nonappealable Law or any Governmental Authority
takes any other action that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or
otherwise prohibited provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, such action.

Section 10.3 _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ or by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section
10.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 10.1(d)(iii)_, then the Company shall, prior to or
concurrently with any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ or promptly upon the termination of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)(ii) or (iii)_ pay the
Termination Fee to the account set forth by Parent in _Section 10.3(a)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to _Section 10.1(d)(i)_ but only if after the date hereof and prior to such
termination, a _bona fide_ , written Company Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly announced or made known and not withdrawn or abandoned at the
time of termination and within twelve months after such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates,
such Company Acquisition Proposal then, within three Business Days after the
date of consummation of such transaction, the Company shall pay the
Termination Fee.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Merger Sub or the
Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_, but only if (A) the Minimum
Condition was not satisfied or, with the consent of the Company, waived and
all other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto were satisfied upon the
conclusion of the Offer, (B) after the date hereof and prior to such
termination, a _bona fide_ , written Company Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly announced or made known and not withdrawn or abandoned at the
time of termination and  



 

56  (C) within twelve months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, such
Company Acquisition Proposal then, within three Business Days after the date
of consummation of such transaction, the Company shall pay the Termination
Fee.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
10.1(c)(iv)_, Parent shall promptly pay the Company a fee equal to eighteen
million dollars ($18 million) (the "Company Termination Fee") (in which case,
the fee shall be payable within three Business Days after such termination by
wire transfer of same day funds). If Parent becomes obligated to pay the
Company Termination Fee as a result of this  _Section 10.3(d)_, the Company
agrees that its right to receive the Company Termination Fee upon termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(iv)_ shall be its sole and
exclusive remedy against Parent and Merger Sub and upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 10.3(d)_ neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement.

(f) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this _Section 10.3_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. Parent agrees that the payment of the Termination Fee
provided for in this _Section 10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub upon termination of this agreement under circumstances
giving rise to an obligation (or potential obligation) of the Company to pay
the amounts set forth in this _Section 10.3_ and such remedy shall be limited
to the sum stipulated in this _Section 10.3_ and the Company shall have no
further liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(h) Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 10.3_ shall be net of any
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

Section 10.4 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or  _Section 10.2_
shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.1_ or
_Section 10.2,_ this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, except
that provisions of _Section 2.1(e)_, _Section 8.5(c)_, _Section 8.5(d)_,
_Section 10.3_,  _Section 10.4_ and _Article XI_ will survive the
termination hereof, (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties
hereto, as applicable, from liabilities or damages arising out of a material
breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement (with respect to which a party retains all rights
and remedies available to it at law or in equity), and (c) no termination of
this Agreement shall in any way affect any of the parties rights or
obligations with respect to, or the right of any stockholder of the Company
who tendered, any shares of Common Stock accepted for payment and paid for
pursuant to the Offer prior to such termination. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that the Companys damages may not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs.

such extent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and

in this Agreement (a) no party makes, and no party has made, any
representations or warranties relating to itself or its businesses or
otherwise in connection with the Merger, (b) no person has been authorized by

Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

Section 11.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that, after

may be made which under applicable Law requires the further approval of the
stockholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto.

Section 11.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered

Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or
remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

Section 11.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this

assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect); provided,
however, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder.

Section 11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard
to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

Section 11.8 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This

obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except (i) as provided in
_Section 8.7_ and (ii) for the right of the Company Stockholders and holders
of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units to receive the Merger
Consideration, Parent stock options or Parent restricted stock units as

59 Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any
applicable Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to its subject matter and supersede all oral or written prior or
contemporaneous agreements and understandings among the parties with respect
to such subject matter.

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur,
damages would be difficult to determine and would be an insufficient remedy
and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (or any
party hereto threatens such a breach). Accordingly, (a) Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by the Company or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity and (b) except in the case of a No Fault
Financing Failure (the sole remedy for which shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 10.3(d)_ hereof and to which case the provisions of this Article
11.11 will be inapplicable), the Company shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, to prevent breaches of or enforce compliance with those covenants
of Parent or Merger Sub that require Parent or Merger Sub to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) satisfy the Tender Offer
Conditions and the conditions to closing set forth in _Article IX_ , and
comply with it covenants and obligations hereunder, including the covenants
set forth in  _Section 8.4_ and (ii) consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub expressly agree not to raise as a defense or
objection to the request or granting of the relief of specific performance
that any breach of this Agreement is or would be compensable by an award of
money damages or remedied at law or in equity by another means.

Section 11.12 _Jurisdiction_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction over the matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware in any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
11.1_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 



 

60 (b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.12_.

Section 11.13 _Authorship_. The parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
