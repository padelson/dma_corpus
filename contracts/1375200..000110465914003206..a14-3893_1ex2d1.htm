form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) change, modify or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit A), (D) add to the Offer
Conditions, or (E) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub agree that if on any scheduled expiration date of
the Offer, any of the conditions to the offer (including the Minimum Tender
Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth herein and in
Exhibit A) is not satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived, then
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for
successive periods of time to be determined at the sole discretion of the
Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Merger Sub be
required to extend the Offer (1) beyond the Outside Date or (2) at any time
that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
ARTICLE VIII.

 



 

(iii) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 1.1(d)) all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after Merger Sub is legally permitted to do so under
applicable Law. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " **Offer Closing** ", and
the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as
the " **Offer Closing Date** ". Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to, in
its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the Offer for a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act, and the Offer Documents (as defined below) may, in Merger Subs sole
discretion, provide for such a reservation of right. Nothing contained in this
Section 1.1(a) shall affect any termination rights in ARTICLE VIII.

 



 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits
thereto, the " **Schedule TO** "), which shall contain an offer to purchase
and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
appropriate ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the " **Offer Documents** "), and cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as and
to the extent required by federal securities laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents as so amended or

 



      
 

 



 

supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer
Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence and summaries of all material oral communications between them
and their representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand.
Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders
of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents
or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to
any such comments. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub receives any
comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly to such comments
and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues raised
therein.

 



 

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for,
pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub or the paying agent for the Offer (the " **Paying
Agent** ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable Treasury
Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the " **Code** "), or any provision of
state or local Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over by Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent to the appropriate taxing
authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent.

to (i) respond promptly to such comments and (ii) take all other actions
necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

Stock as of the latest practicable date and of those persons becoming record
holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of

information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub
such information and assistance (including periodically updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common
Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall take such actions as may be reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

required to protect the unauthorized disclosure or use of information received
by it pursuant to this Section 1.2.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 



 

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and (ii) the percentage
that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent
and/or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment) bears to the total
number of shares outstanding, and the Company shall cause Parents designees
to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the
number of directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent
directors. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated
by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole
number, on each committee of the Company Board that represents the same
percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board.

 



 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions necessary

stockholders information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3(b), which, unless Parent otherwise elects,
shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the
Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect
to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under Section
1.3(a) hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such information.

 



 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2(b)
hereof), the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office who were not designated by Parent shall be required to authorize (and
such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and
no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of
this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring
action by the Company Board, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company or any other action (or inaction) under or in
connection with this Agreement if such action (or inaction) would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the Companys stockholders (other than Parent
or Merger Sub).

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Company Common Stock:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all
vested and unvested shares of restricted stock issued in connection with
restricted stock awards granted to the executive officers of the Company (the
transfer restrictions on which shares shall terminate immediately prior to the
Effective Time) but not including shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(c) hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive cash and the Contingent Cash Consideration Payments equal in form and
amount to the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the " **Merger Consideration**
"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of any Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance
with Section 3.2, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Common Stock** ")
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
the shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is held by the Company as treasury shares and each share of Company
Common Stock which is owned by the Company or Parent or by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent shall be cancelled
without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect
thereof.

 



 

(d) _Company Options_. Effective not later than the Closing, the Company shall
take all actions required to provide that, effective as of the Closing, the
Company Stock Plan (as defined in Section 4.2(a) hereof) and all Company
Options (as defined in Section 4.2(a) hereof) outstanding immediately before
the Closing shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect, and in
consideration for such cancellation of Company Options outstanding under the
Company Stock Plan immediately before the Closing, the holders thereof
(whether or not such Company Options shall otherwise be exercisable at the
Effective Time) shall automatically (and without any further action being
required on the part of the holders thereof) receive, at the earliest
Valuation Point, if any, at which the then applicable Per Share Paid Value
exceeds the per-share exercise price under such Company Option:

 



 

(i) an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each such Company Option (whether vested or unvested) held by
such holder multiplied by the excess, of (1) the then applicable Per Share
Paid Value over (2) the per-share exercise price under such Company Option
(with such payments to be subject to any applicable Tax withholding in
accordance with Section 3.1(h)); and

 



 

(ii) the right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
subject to each such Company Option (whether vested or unvested) held by such
holder, each Contingent Cash Consideration Payment that, as of such Valuation
Point, has not yet become payable pursuant to the terms of the Contingent Cash
Consideration Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Other Equity Awards_. Effective not later than the Closing, the Company
shall take all actions required to provide that (i) each award (" **Other
Equity Award** ") outstanding immediately before the Effective Time under the
Company Stock Plans other than the Company Options (including any restricted
stock units) shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time and (ii) in exchange for the cancellation of each such Other
Equity Award, to the extent vested as of immediately before the Effective
Time, in accordance with the terms of such Other Equity Award (including any
vesting that occurs under the terms of the applicable Other Equity Award as a
result of the consummation of this Agreement), the holder of such Other Equity
Awards shall receive the per share Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Other Equity Award (with such payment to
be subject to any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section
3.1(h)). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary such that no Person has any rights to acquire Company Common Stock
or common stock of the Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement following the Effective Time. Additionally, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board shall take any actions required to accelerate the
vesting of, or cause the lapsing of any restrictions with respect to, any
Other Equity Award.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Effective not later than the Closing,
the Company shall take all actions required to provide that, as of the Closing
Date, the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of the Company (the " **2010
ESPP** ") shall be terminated. The Company shall not commence any new purchase
periods under the 2010 ESPP after the date hereof.

 



 

(g) _Warrants_. Each outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase or otherwise
acquire shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Offer Closing
(each, a " **Company Warrant** ") shall as a consequence of the Offer Closing,
only entitle the holder thereof to receive, upon exercise in accordance with
its terms, at the earliest Valuation Point, if any, at which the then
applicable Per Share Paid Value exceeds the per-share exercise price under
such Company Warrant, the Offer Price, in accordance with the terms of such
Company Warrant. As a consequence of the Closing, each such Company Warrant
shall automatically be assumed by the Surviving Corporation. Promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver written notice
to each holder of a Company Warrant, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Warrant, informing such holders of the effect of the Offer
on the Company Warrants.

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock,
Company Options or Other Equity Awards such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is or may be reasonably required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock, Company Options or
Other Equity Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a
nationally-recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
**Exchange Agent** "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Common Stock. All
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
" **Exchange Fund**." If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Funds
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent will, or will cause Merger Sub
(or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to, promptly deposit
cash with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency
required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a certificate
or certificates

 



       
 

 



 

which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the " **Certificates** ") or (ii) uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "), in each
case, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof, (A) a letter of
transmittal (which, in the case of Certificates, shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (1)
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto or (2) or receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange the portion of the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1, and any Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (I) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(II) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon such surrender.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE III.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock 12 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE
III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, and Parent and the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation shall remain jointly and severally liable for, payment
of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any cash or a Contingent Cash
Consideration Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 4.5), any such cash or Contingent
Cash Consideration Payment shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former stockholders of the Company after the Effective Time
pursuant to this ARTICLE III. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this ARTICLE III shall promptly be
paid to Parent.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such portion of the Merger
Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 3.1(a); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct
as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL (the "
**Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be
entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until
such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such

Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the

contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) recommending

Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, taken together, is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company will make
available to Parent a correct and complete copy of the form of such opinion
solely for informational purposes after receipt thereof by the Company.

 



 

(d) The Company has taken all action necessary to exempt the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from Section 203
of the DGCL, and, accordingly, neither such Section nor any other antitakeover
or similar statute or regulation applies to any such transactions. No other
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover
laws enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement or the

default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, give to others any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, result in the triggering of any payment or
other obligation or any right of consent, or result in the creation of a Lien

against the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of its respective

 



      
 

 



 

agents or subcontractors, and there are no consent decrees (including plea
agreements) or similar actions to which the Company is bound or which relate
to the Core Product. The Company is not, to the knowledge of the Company,

Section 4.17 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Set forth in Section 4.17(a) to the Company Disclosure Letter is a true
and complete list of all (i) patents and patent applications, trademarks and
service marks and all applications and registrations therefor, all Internet
domain names and copyrights included in the Company Owned IP and (ii) patents,
patent applications, trademarks and service marks included in the Company
Licensed IP.

 



 

(b) The Company has an unrestricted and exclusive ownership interest in all
Company Owned IP (in each case, free and clear of any Liens) and is listed in
the records of the appropriate United States, foreign or other registry as the
sole and exclusive current owner of record for each application and
registration included in the Company Owned IP. Other than with respect to the
Products other than the Core Product, the Company IP includes all Intellectual
Property, and the Companys rights in and to such Company IP include all
Intellectual Property rights, used or otherwise exploited in or necessary for
the conduct of the business of the Company as currently conducted. No academic
institution or Governmental Entity has any right, title or interest in or to
any Company Owned IP (including any "march in" rights) or any Intellectual
Property included in Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The
Company has taken commercially reasonable efforts, or contractually requires
the Company Partners in those jurisdictions where the Core Product is marketed
or sold solely through Company Partners to take commercially reasonable
efforts, to make appropriate submissions of the Company IP to the FDAs
"Orange Book" and all equivalent documents maintained by the

 



      
 

 



 

EMEA or any other Regulatory Authority for jurisdictions in which the Company
sells, markets or authorizes the sale or marketing of the Core Product.

 



 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, the Contracts under which the Company has
been granted rights in any Intellectual Property owned or controlled by a
third Person are valid and legally enforceable, and free and clear of all
Liens. The Company is not in breach of, and during the past six years has not
breached, any of the foregoing Contracts. The Company has provided Parent with
access to true and complete copies of all Contracts under which the Company
has obtained or granted any rights, title or interests in or to, or which by
their terms expressly restrict the Company with respect to any Intellectual
Property (each, an " **IP Contract** ") related to any or all of the Products,
other than standard license agreements for commercially-available, off-the-
shelf software. The Company has the exclusive right to develop, commercialize,
manufacture, market, sell, import and otherwise exploit the Core Product and
the Company has not granted, assigned or otherwise transferred to any Person
any right, title or interest in or to any Core Product or Core Product IP.

 



 

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, no Person, during the past six years, has
misappropriated, infringed, diluted, or otherwise violated, either directly or
indirectly, any Company IP, nor is any Person currently doing so. No
Litigation has been brought or threatened against any Person during the past
six years, with respect to any Company IP by the Company or, with respect to
any or all of the Core Product IP and to the knowledge of the Company, by any
of its licensors during the past six years and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there is no basis for any Litigation regarding any of the foregoing.

 



 

(e) (i) There has not been any Litigation during the past six years with
respect to any Company IP, to the knowledge of the Company there is no pending
or threatened Litigation (A) alleging misappropriation, infringement, dilution
or other violation by the Company of any Intellectual Property of any Person,
(B) challenging the Companys ownership or use of, or the registrability or
maintenance of, any Company Owned IP, (C) challenging the validity or
enforceability of any Company Owned IP, (D) alleging that the use by the
Company of Company Licensed IP is in breach of any applicable grant, license,
agreement, instrument or other arrangement pursuant to which the Company or
any Affiliate acquired the right to use such Intellectual Property, or (E)
alleging misuse or antitrust violations arising from the use or other
exploitation of any Intellectual Property, and (ii) with respect to (1) the
Core Product and (2) any other material Company IP, to the knowledge of the
Company, there is no reasonable basis for any Litigation regarding any of the
foregoing in (i)(A), (i)(B), (i)(C), (i)(D) or (i)(E); no Company IP has been
or is being used or enforced by the Company or, with respect to any or all of
the Core Product IP, by any of its licensors, in a manner that, individually
or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in the cancellation,
invalidity or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

 



 

(f) All patents and patent applications, trademark registrations and
applications and all other applications, registrations and filings under the
Company IP (i) meet all material applicable requirements for obtaining a
patent, trademark registration or other Intellectual Property registration,
including any applicable disclosure requirements, (ii) are subsisting, in full
force and effect, (iii) are valid and enforceable, (iv) have not expired, been
cancelled or abandoned, and (v) have had paid in a timely manner all
registration, maintenance

 



      
 

 



 

and renewal fees necessary to preserve the rights of the Company in connection
with such Intellectual Property.

 



 

(g) The Company has taken all commercially reasonable measures to obtain
patent rights worldwide, to the extent commercially reasonable to do so, under
Company Owned IP and Company Licensed IP as to which they have the necessary
prosecution rights, and, to the knowledge of the Company, have not forfeited
or otherwise lost any right to file any material patent applications or obtain
any material patents in any country in North America or those countries in
Europe or Asia in which the Company has the necessary prosecution rights and
where the Company or Company Partners market, sell, manufacture, develop or
distribute the Core Product, such as by failing to meet any filing deadline or
otherwise; the Company has no reason to believe that the scope of any issued
claims under any patents under the Company IP should be less than the scope
reflected as of the date hereof in such patents or that the scope of any
allowed claims under any patent applications under the Company IP will or
should be materially less than the scope reflected as of the date hereof in
such patent applications.

 



 

(h) The Company has not granted any Person any right to control the
prosecution or registration of any Product or to bring, defend or otherwise
control any Litigations with respect to any Product, except as expressly
permitted under an IP Contract.

 



 

(i) The Company has not entered into and is not subject to any consents,
judgments, orders, indemnifications, forbearances to sue, settlement
agreements, licenses or other arrangements in connection with the resolution
of any disputes or Litigation that (i) restricts the Company with respect to
any material Intellectual Property, (ii) restricts the Companys businesses in
any material manner in order to accommodate any Persons Intellectual
Property, or (iii) permits any Person to use any material Company IP except as
expressly permitted under an IP Contract.

 



 

(j) The Company has implemented reasonable measures to maintain the
confidentiality of the trade secrets and other proprietary information under
the Company IP. No current or former employee or contractor of the Company
owns any right, title or interest in or to any of the Company Owned IP. To the
knowledge of the Company, there has not been any disclosure of any material
confidential information of the Company (including any such information of any
other Person disclosed in confidence to the Company) to any Person in a manner
that has resulted or is likely to result in the loss of trade secret or other
rights in and to such information. The Company has complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws, as well as its own rules, policies, and
procedures, relating to privacy, data protection, and the collection and use
of personally identifiable information.

(b) With respect to the real property identified as being leased or subleased
by the Company in Section 4.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (which real
property constitutes all of the real property leased or subleased as of the
date hereof by the Company for leases having an outstanding term of 12 months
or more), (i) each lease or sublease

Lease except in accordance with its terms or with respect to the normal

Parent or Parents use of such information, including any information,
documents or material made available to Parent in the due diligence materials
provided to Parent, including in the "data room," other management

obligations with respect to confidentiality ( _provided_ , that the Company

under this Agreement. All information provided pursuant to this Section 6.2

Section 6.3 _Notification of Certain Matters; Regulatory Communications_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, as the case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely
to cause (a)(i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality", "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any
respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such party contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each
case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Offer
Closing or (b) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. In
addition, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, as the case may be, of any change or event
having, or which is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would
be reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Annex A to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.3 will not limit or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

(b) The Company: (i) shall keep Parent promptly informed of (A) any
communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMEA and any other
Regulatory Authority and (B) any material communications (written or oral)

Section 6.4 _Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) In the event that Parent determines, in good faith, that any filing would
be necessary under the HSR Act or any Competition Laws, as the case may be,
Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such determination and each party
shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other parties and to
the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than five business days) after the date of such notification, (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all other
necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and

Act,

 



      
 

 



 

the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond at the earliest practicable date to any formal or informal
requests for additional information made by the United States Federal Trade
Commission, United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in
connection with any investigation of any Governmental Entity. Each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and
notice. The Company shall give Parent reasonable prior notice of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any filings, forms, declarations, notifications,
registrations or notices, and permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of Parent in connection with,
any proposed communication, understanding or agreement with any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. The
Company shall not independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings or inquiry without giving Parent prior notice of the meeting and,
unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. The Company will consult and cooperate with Parent in
connection with any information or proposals submitted in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. Parent shall notify the
Company of any communication with any Governmental Entity to the extent
related to the Competition Laws as applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each
use its reasonable best efforts: (x) to avoid the entry of any judgment that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing; (y) to eliminate every
impediment under any Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date (as defined herein)); and (z)
vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any
administrative or judicial action.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all other necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties related to or required in connection with the Offer or the Merger that
are necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the preparation of any documents that
may be required to be filed with the SEC, (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and
(v) the providing of all such information concerning such party, its
subsidiaries, its Affiliates and its subsidiaries and

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates officers, directors, employees and partners as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any of the matters set forth in Section 6.4(a) or
this Section 6.4(b). Each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain each of the consents or provide each of
the notices, as applicable, prior to the Offer Closing, that are listed in
Section 6.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to divest any of its businesses,
product lines or assets, or take or agree to take any other action or agree to
any limitation or restriction.

 



 

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which is reasonably
expected to, facilitate, any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any
agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate with, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal and request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
any such Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer
Closing, in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that the
Company Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Company
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the
date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.5(a),
the Company may, if a majority of the Company Board determines (after
consultation with outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with this Section 6.5(a) and
Section 6.5(c) and after giving Parent written notice of such determination,
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall include a customary
"standstill" or similar covenant) not less restrictive of such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement and containing provisions allowing necessary
disclosures to Parent pursuant to Section 6.5(c) hereof; _provided_ that (1)
all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to the time it is provided to such Person and (2) such customary
confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for the Company to
comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.5(b) and Section
6.5(c), and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.5(a) by any
Representative or Affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach

 



      
 

 



 

of this Section 6.5(a) by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Companys release or waiver of any "standstill" agreement to which it is a
party shall not violate this Section 6.5; _provided_ that the Company shall
advise Parent orally and in writing no later than 24 hours prior to any such
release or waiver that the Company shall enter into such release or waiver.

 



 

The term " **Company Takeover Proposal** " means any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any Person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to,
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of transactions, of any Product or of assets or businesses that constitute 15%
or more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense,
taxes, depreciation and amortization) or the assets of the Company, taken as a
whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or the
stockholders of any Person would own 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

The term " **Superior Proposal** " means a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal
( _provided_ , that for purposes of this definition references to 15% in the
definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
50%) which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Offer
and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer and this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, (i) (A)
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " **Company Adverse Recommendation Change** ") or (ii) adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or enter into,
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 6.5(a) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set forth
therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer
Closing Date, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if a majority of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that
failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made
until after the second business day following Parents receipt of written
notice (a " **Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation** ") from the Company
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any
Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board (it being understood and agreed that (x) any amendment to any material
term of such Superior Proposal or (y) with respect to any previous Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, any material change in the principal stated
rationale by the Company Board for such previous Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, shall, in the case of either (x) or (y), require a new
Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation promptly (and in any case within 24
hours), at which point a new two business day-period shall commence). In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Company Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or otherwise.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.5(a)
and Section 6.5(b), (i) the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing (and in any case within 24 hours) of any Company Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry that is reasonably expected to lead to any Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) the
Company shall (A) keep Parent fully and promptly informed of the status and
material details (including any change to any material term thereof) of any
such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to Parent promptly
after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to the Company from any Person that
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Company Takeover Proposal or
inquiry. In addition, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Offer Closing, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement to which it is a party.
During such period, the Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by
obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the
United States of America or of any state having jurisdiction.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14(e)-2(a)
or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders (including any amendments to its
Schedule 14D-9 relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change ) if, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof shall comply with the
provisions of Section 6.5(a).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 to the contrary, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, reimburse or agree to
reimburse the

 



      
 

 



 

expenses of any Third Party (other than the Companys Representatives) in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer
or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover
Proposal.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its directors relating
to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, except that Parent shall not be
obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include full release of
Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable
relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation).

 



 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance._

 



 

(a) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company
(collectively, the " **Indemnified Parties** ") to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any Indemnified Parties for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent agrees to, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless such Persons
to the fullest extent permitted by law for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) advance or pay any expenses of any
Indemnified Party with respect to any such matter pursuant to the Company
Certificate of Incorporation, Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements;
and (iii) cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " **D
andO Insurance**") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy
or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 250 percent of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor a single premium
tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance at a level at least as favorable
as in the DandO Insurance.

 



 

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.7.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The rights and obligations under this Section 6.7 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner
that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such
Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom
this Section 6.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.7 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants and agreements contained
herein.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release shall be a joint
press release and thereafter, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Offer Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company and Parent each shall
obtain the prior consent of the other prior to issuing any press releases or
making other public statements and communications with respect to the Merger,
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Products, except as
may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of Nasdaq. In addition, the Company and Parent shall develop a
joint communications strategy and each party shall ensure that, during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Offer Closing
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, all
press releases and other public statements and communications (including any
communications that would require a filing under Rules 14d-2 or 14d-9 of the
Exchange Act), with analysts, members of the financial community or otherwise,
with respect to the Offer, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or Products shall be consistent in all material respects with
such joint communications strategy.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company who are employed immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
**Covered Employees** ") who remain employed during such period by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries with
compensation and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) which, taken
as a whole, have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
compensation and benefits provided to the respective Covered Employee by the
Company as of the date hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation (or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to provide Covered
Employees who remain employed during such period by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits
that, taken as a whole, have a value substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the Covered Employees not less than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries from time to time. Parent
shall have no obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have
the effect of requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
specific plans or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under, but not for purposes of benefit accrual under, any
employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall receive service
credit for service with the Company (and with any predecessor or acquired
entities or any other entities for which the Company granted service credit)
as if such service had been completed with Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service

 



      
 

 



 

need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

(c) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or use
reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any pre-
existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any
Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health or
welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (a " **New Plan** ") in which such Covered Employee or covered
dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the
extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer subject to
such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding Company Benefit

Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
the amount(s) due pursuant to this Section 8.2(c), the Company shall pay to
Parent its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and

payment was required to be made.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Amendments_. Subject to Section 1.3(c) and subject to compliance
with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of the Company, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the
amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement
to the holders of Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law otherwise
expressly requires the further approval of such stockholders. No amendment
shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.4 _Waiver_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to the

of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto
or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or
compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other
party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly
authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts
and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements (including the Confidentiality Agreement
and the documents and instruments referred to herein or therein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and (b) except for the provisions of Section

than the parties hereto any rights or remedies or benefits of any nature
whatsoever.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or

that any such matter is material for the purpose of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as

the extent possible.

of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material
portion of the business or assets of Parent or the Company (whether held

and

 



 

(xi) the Company and Parent shall not have reached an agreement that the Offer
or the Agreement be terminated, and the Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with its terms.
