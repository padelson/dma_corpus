be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified or their earlier death,

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 1.7 CONVERSION
OF SECURITIES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders of any securities of the Bidder or the
Company:   (1) Each issued and outstanding Share that is owned by the
Bidder or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (2) Subject to
the provisions of Sections 2.2(h) and 2.4, each issued and outstanding Share,
other than Shares cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted, at the election of the holder thereof
in accordance with the procedures set forth herein, into one of the following
(as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.1, the "Merger
Consideration"):   (1) for each such Share with respect to  which an
election to receive only Bidder Common Stock has been  effectively made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2(a) (a  "Stock Election"), the
right to receive that fraction of a share of  Bidder Common Stock calculated
by dividing (x) $62.50 by (y) the  Average Bidder Trading Price (as
hereinafter defined), rounded to four  decimal places (the "Exchange Ratio").
As used herein, the "Average  Bidder Trading Price" shall mean the average of
the reported closing  sales prices per share of Bidder Common Stock as
reported in THE WALL  STREET JOURNAL for the 20 consecutive Nasdaq National
Market trading  days (each, a "Trading Day") ending on (and including) the
third  Trading Day prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the quotient obtained as prescribed in the 
preceding sentence exceeds 1.0417, then for all purposes the Exchange  Ratio
shall be 1.0417, and if such quotient is less than 0.7813, then  for all
purposes the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.7813 (the "Stock  Election
Consideration").   (2) for each such Share with respect to  which an
election to receive only cash has been effectively made and  not revoked or
lost pursuant to Section 2.2(a) (a "Cash Election"), (i)  the right to
receive an amount    4    in cash equal to $62.50 multiplied by the Cash
Election Proration  Factor, without interest except as set forth in Section
2.2(b), plus  (ii) if the Cash Election Proration Factor is less than 1, a
fraction  of a share of Bidder Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio 
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is $62.50 minus the  cash
determined pursuant to clause (i) and the denominator of which is  $62.50. As
used herein, the "Cash Election Proration Factor" means the  lesser of (x)
1.00 or (y) a fraction (i) the numerator of which is (1)  the product of the
total number of Shares outstanding multiplied by  $17.50 minus (2) $17.50
multiplied by the number of Shares for which  Standard Elections have been
effectively made and not revoked or lost,  and (ii) the denominator of which
is the product of $62.50 multiplied  by the number of Shares for which Cash
Elections have been effectively  made and not revoked or lost.   (3) for
each such Share as to which neither  a Stock Election nor a Cash Election has
been effectively made and not  revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2(a) (a
"Standard Election"), the  right to receive $17.50 in cash, plus a fraction
of a share of Bidder  Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by
.7200 (the  "Standard Election Consideration").   (3) Each Person who, at
the Effective Time, is a record holder of Shares (other than Shares to be
cancelled as set forth in Section 2.1(a) or Dissenting Shares) shall have the
right to submit an Election Form specifying the number of Shares that such
Person desires to have converted into shares of Bidder Common Stock, the
number of Shares that such Person desires to have converted into the right to
receive cash and Bidder Common Stock, if any, and the number of Shares that
such Person desires to have converted into the right to receive the Standard
Election Consideration. Any Person who fails properly to submit an Election
Form on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance set forth in Section
2.2(a) shall be deemed to have made a Standard Election.   (4) Each share
of Bidder Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall on and after the Effective Time continue to be issued
and outstanding as an identical share of Bidder Common Stock.   (5) Each
share of Bidder Common Stock issued and held in the treasury or by any
Subsidiary of the Bidder as of the Effective Time, if any, shall, on and
after the Effective Time, continue to be issued and held in the treasury of
the Bidder or such Subsidiary unaffected by the Merger.    5    Section
1.8 SURRENDER AND PAYMENT.   (1) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Bidder shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
purpose of (i) exchanging certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time the
Bidder will deposit with the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration and cash
in the amount required by Section 2.2(g) (the "Exchange Fund"). Upon receipt,
the Exchange Agent will invest the cash portion of the Exchange Fund in
United States government securities maturing at the Election Deadline or such
other government securities maturing at the Election Deadline or such other
investments as the Bidder and the Company may mutually agree. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Bidder.
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will send to each
holder of Shares a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange, and to each holder of Shares an election form (the
"Election Form") providing for such holders to make the Standard Election,
the Cash Election or the Stock Election. Any Standard Election (other than a
deemed Standard Election), Cash Election or Stock Election shall be validly
made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received by 5:00 p.m., New York
City Time, on a date (the "Election Deadline") to be mutually agreed upon by
the Bidder and the Company (which date shall not be later than the twentieth
Business Day after the Effective Time), an Election Form properly completed
and executed (with the signature or signatures thereon guaranteed to the
extent required by the Election Form) by such holder accompanied by such
holder\'s Certificates, or by appropriate guarantees of delivery of such
Certificates from a member of any national securities exchange or of the
National Association of Securities Dealers or a commercial bank or trust
company in the United States as set forth in such Election Form. Any holder
of Shares who has made an election by submitting an Election Form to
the Exchange Agent may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change
such holder\'s election by submitting a revised Election Form, properly
completed and signed that is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. Any holder of Shares may at any time prior to the to the
Election Deadline revoke his election and withdraw his Certificates deposited
with the Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent received by
the close of business on the day prior to the Election Deadline, and such
holder will receive the Standard Election Consideration.   (2) LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, each   
6   holder of Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after the
Election Deadline the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented by its Certificate. In addition, each such holder of Shares shall
be entitled to receive any dividends and distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(g). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.   (3) PAYMENT TO NON-REGISTERED OWNERS. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (4) NO
FURTHER REGISTRATION OF TRANSFERS. After the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares. If after the Effective Time
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article II.   (5) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND;
NO LIABILITY. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it any remaining portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto), and holders shall be entitled to
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Bidder Common Stock and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to Bidder Common Stock payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (6) LOST,
STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificates for Shares
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Bidder, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such    7   sum as the Bidder may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) deliverable in respect of the Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates.   (7)
DIVIDENDS; DISTRIBUTIONS. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Bidder Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Bidder Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.2(h), and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Bidder Common Stock shall be paid by the Bidder to
the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case
until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the
holder of a Bidder Certificate representing whole shares of Bidder Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Bidder Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Bidder Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(h), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Bidder Common
Stock. The Bidder shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these
purposes, if necessary.   (8) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No Bidder Certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Bidder Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates; no dividend or
distribution by the Bidder shall relate to such fractional share interests;
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights as a shareholder of the Bidder. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, each holder of Certificate who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fractional share interest in exchange for such
Certificate pursuant to this Section shall receive from the Exchange Agent an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
Shares held by such holder at the Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled
by (B) the average reported closing sales price for a share of Bidder Common
Stock as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (or if not reported thereby, any
other authoritative source) for five consecutive Trading Days immediately
preceding the    8   Closing Date. The Bidder shall provide the Exchange
Agent the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Section 2.2(h)
promptly following the Effective Time.   Section 1.9 ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT
DILUTION. In the event that the Bidder changes the number of outstanding
shares of Bidder Common Stock or the number of outstanding securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Bidder Common
Stock prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction, or declares or
pays any dividend or distribution (including of rights) other than any
regular quarterly cash dividends, the Stock Election Consideration and the
Standard Election Consideration will be correspondingly and equitably
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, split, combination of
shares or other specified transaction.   Section 1.10 APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by shareholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who comply
with all the relevant provisions of Section 33-861 of the CBCA (the
"Dissenting Shareholders") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"),
unless and until the holder or holders thereof shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under
the CBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder\'s Shares shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each Share without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give the Bidder (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the CBCA and received by
the Company relating to shareholders\' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the CBCA; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Company
shall have the right to participate in any such negotiations and proceedings.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Bidder, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent,
the Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be treated as
though such Shares had been converted into the right to receive the Standard
Election Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b).    9     Section
1.11 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Bidder shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. If the Bidder so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders
of Shares in respect of which the Bidder made such deduction and
withholding.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   Except as
set forth on the schedule delivered by the Company to the Bidder in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") the Company hereby represents and warrants to the
Bidder, and except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Bidder to the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the "Bidder Disclosure Schedule), the Bidder hereby
represents and warrants to the Company, in each case as set forth in this
Article III, with the party making such representations and warranties being
referred to as the "Representing Party" and such Representing Party\'s
Disclosure Schedule as the "Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation or warranty which expressly
refers to the Bidder or its Subsidiaries is being made solely by the Bidder
and any representation or warranty which expressly refers to the Company or
Life Technologies or their respective Subsidiaries is being made solely by
the Company.   Section 1.12 ORGANIZATION, QUALIFICATION, ETC.   (1) The
Representing Party is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the corporate power and authority required for it to own its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Representing Party is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Representing Party or substantially delay consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent the
Representing Party from performing its obligations hereunder. As used in this
Agreement, any reference to any    10   state of facts, event, change or
effect having a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect to the
Representing Party means a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Representing
Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding any such effect
resulting from or arising in connection with (A) changes or
conditions generally affecting the industries in which the Representing Party
and its Subsidiaries operate unless, in the case of the Company, such changes
or effects have a disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) changes in general economic,
regulatory or political conditions, unless, in the case of the Company, such
changes have a disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Each Representing Party has made available to the other
copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Such copies of each
Representing Party\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws are complete
and correct and in full force and effect, and the Representing Party is not
in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws.   (2) Each of the Representing Party\'s Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Each of
the Representing Party\'s Subsidiaries has the corporate power and authority
required for it to own its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties
or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party. All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, the Representing
Party\'s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and, with respect to such shares or ownership interests that
are owned by the Representing Party and its Subsidiaries, are owned free and
clear of all liens, claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges and security
interests of any kind (each, a "Lien"). All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other ownership interests in, the Representing Party\'s
Subsidiaries are wholly owned by the Representing Party, directly or
indirectly, except for the Life Technologies Common Stock of which the
Company beneficially owns as of the date hereof 18,815,447 shares.

Subsidiary of the Company.   Section 1.13 CAPITAL STOCK.    11   (1)

employee or non-employee director benefit plans, and, with respect to the
Company, indicating the name of the plan, the date of grant, the number of

assessable and issued in compliance with all applicable U.S. state and
federal and foreign securities laws. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of

Agreement, (1) there are no shares of capital stock of the Representing Party

other entity.   Section 1.14 EQUITY INVESTMENTS.   (1) Section 3.3(a) of
the Company\'s Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i) the name of each
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity (other than the
Subsidiaries) in which the Company or Life Technologies has, or pursuant to

Bidder), will, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
be owned by the Bidder, directly or indirectly, in each case, free and clear

The Representing Party has previously furnished or otherwise made available
(by electronic filing or otherwise) to the Bidder true and complete copies
of:   (1) Annual Reports on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for each of the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1999 in the case of the Company and Life Technologies and the year ended
December 31, 1999 in the case of Bidder.   (2) the Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q filed with the SEC for the quarter ended March 31, 2000, for each of the
Representing Parties and, in the case of the Company, for Life
Technologies;   (3) each definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC
since December 31, 1998, for each of the Representing Parties and, in

of the Company, for Life Technologies; and   (5) all Current Reports on Form
8-K filed with the SEC since January 1, 2000, for each of the Representing
Parties and, in the case of the Company, for Life Technologies.   As of
their respective dates, such reports, proxy statements and prospectuses filed
with the SEC by the Representing Party (collectively with, and giving effect
to, all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "SEC Reports") (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and (ii) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Other than Life Technologies which is registered under Section 12 of the
Exchange Act, none of the Representing Party\'s Subsidiaries is required to
file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements included in the Representing Party\'s (and in the case
of the Company, Life Technologies\') SEC Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly present in all material respects the financial position
of the Bidder, the Company or Life Technologies and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as of the dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows for the periods or as of the dates then ended
(subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to
normal recurring year-end adjustments), in each case in accordance with past
practice and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved (except as
otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto). Since the date of
Bidder\'s initial public offering, the Bidder has timely filed all reports,
registration statements and other filings required to be filed by it with the
SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Since January 1, 1999, each
of the Company and Life Technologies has timely filed all reports,
registration statements and other filings required to be filed by it with the
SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC.   Section 1.17 NO
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Neither the Representing Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature required to be
set forth on a balance sheet of the Representing Party under GAAP, whether or
not accrued, contingent or otherwise, and there is no existing condition,
situation or set of circumstances which would be expected to result in such a
liability or obligation, except    16   (a) liabilities or obligations
reflected in the Representing Party\'s SEC Reports or (b) liabilities and
obligations which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party.  
Section 1.18 NO VIOLATION OF LAW. The businesses of the Representing Party
and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any order, writ,
injunction, decree, judgment, permit, license, ordinance, law, statute, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Entity (PROVIDED that no representation or
warranty is made in this Section 3.7 with respect to Environmental Laws),
except (a) as described in the Representing Party\'s SEC Reports, and (b) for
violations or possible violations which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Representing Party.   Section 1.19 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   (1) Each of
the Representing Party and its Subsidiaries has obtained all licenses,
permits, authorizations, approvals and consents from Governmental Entities
which are required under any applicable Environmental Law and necessary for
it to carry on its business or operations as now conducted ("Environmental
Permits"), except for such failures to have Environmental Permits which,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party. Each of such Environmental
Permits is in full force and effect, and each of the Representing Party and
its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such
Environmental Permits and with all applicable Environmental Laws, except for
such failures to be in full force and effect or to be in compliance which,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party.   (2) There are no
Environmental Claims pending, or to the knowledge of the Representing Party,
threatened, against the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to
the knowledge of the Representing Party, any Person whose liability for any
such Environmental Claim the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries
has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of
law for which reserves have not been established in accordance with GAAP,
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Representing Party. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has
available cash resources that are adequate to fund the GAAP reserves that the
Company has established in respect of Environmental Claims, and such cash
resources will be adequate for such purpose at the Effective Time; PROVIDED
that there shall have been no change outside the    17   ordinary
course of business in the capitalization or asset base of the Company\'s
captive insurance companies.   (3) There are no past or present actions,
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including,
without limitation, the release, threatened release or presence of any
Hazardous Material, that would form the basis of any Environmental Claim
against the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the
Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries is liable, except for such
liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party.   (4)

action, lawsuit or proceeding by any Person which seeks to impose  liability
(including, without limitation, liability for investigatory  costs, cleanup
costs, governmental response costs, natural resources,  damages, property
damages, personal injuries or penalties) arising out  of, based on or
resulting from (A) the presence, or release or  threatened release, of any
Hazardous Materials at any location, whether  or not owned or operated by the
Representing Party or any of its  Subsidiaries, or (B) circumstances which
would give rise to any  violation, or alleged violation, of any Environmental
Law.   (2) "Environmental Law" means any law or  order of any Governmental
Entity relating to (A) the generation,  treatment, storage, disposal, use,
handling, manufacturing,  transportation or shipment of, or (B) the

Hazardous Materials,  into the environment.   (3) "Hazardous Materials"
means (A) any  petroleum or petroleum products, radioactive materials or
friable  asbestos; (B) any chemicals or other materials or substances which
are  now defined as or included in the definition of "hazardous
substances,"  "hazardous wastes," "hazardous materials," "extremely
hazardous  wastes," "restricted hazardous wastes," "toxic substances," or
"toxic  pollutants" under any Environmental Law; and (C) pesticides.  
Section 1.20 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; ERISA.    18    (1) Section 3.9(a)
of the Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete
list of each material deferred compensation, incentive compensation or equity
compensation plan; "welfare" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")); "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA); each material employment, termination or severance
agreement; and each other material employee benefit plan, fund, program,
agreement or arrangement, in each case, that is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Representing Party
(and, in the case of the Company, Life Technologies) or by any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together
with the Representing Party (or Life Technologies) would be deemed at any
relevant time a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b)
of ERISA, for the benefit of any employee or former employee of the
Representing Party or any Subsidiary (the "Plans").   (2) In respect of
Plans that are not International Plans, the Representing Party has made
available to the other Party: (i) correct and complete copies of all
documents embodying each Plan including (without limitation) all amendments
thereto and all related trust documents; (ii) the most recent annual reports
(Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached
thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each
Plan; and (iii) if the Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic
accounting Plan assets.   (3) No liability under Title IV or Section 312
of ERISA has been incurred by the Representing Party or any ERISA Affiliate
of the Representing Party that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to the Representing Party or
any ERISA Affiliate of the Representing Party of incurring any such
liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefits
Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due), except as are
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing
Party. To the knowledge of the Representing Party, each Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code is fully-funded on a termination
basis.   (4) Neither the Representing Party nor any ERISA Affiliate of the
Representing Party has any liability to any Pension Plan which is a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (5) Each Plan
of the Representing Party has been operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code, except as are not reasonably likely to have a Material   
19    Adverse Effect on the Representing Party, and each Plan of the
Representing Party intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts maintained thereunder are
exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, except for failures to
so qualify or be exempt which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing
Party.   (6) Section 3.9(f) of the Representing Party\'s Disclosure
Schedule sets forth each Plan of the Representing Party under which as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) any
current or former employee or officer of the Representing Party or any ERISA
Affiliate of the Representing Party may become entitled to severance pay or
any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)
any compensation due any such employee or officer may be increased or the
time of payment or vesting may become accelerated.   (7) Except as set
forth in Section 3.9(g) of the Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule, no
Plan of the Representing Party which is not an International Plan provides,
or reflects or represents any liability to provide, retiree life insurance,
retiree health or other retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for
any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable law. The
program described by this Section 3.9(g) has at all times provided that the
Representing Party may amend and/or terminate such program without liability
(except in respect of current obligations outstanding for current retired
employees receiving benefits).   (8) There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Representing Party, threatened claims by of on behalf of any
Plan of the Representing Party, by any employee or beneficiary covered under
any such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routing
claims for benefits), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing
Party.   (9) Each Plan of the Representing Party that has been adopted or
maintained by the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
formally or informally, for the benefit of employees outside the
United States ("International Plans") has been established, maintained and
administered in material compliance with its terms and conditions and with
the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that
are applicable to such International Plans. No International Plan of the
Representing Party has unfunded liabilities that would,   
20   individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party.   (10) Except as set
forth in Section 3.9(j) of the Representing Party\'s Disclosure Schedule, the
Representing Party is not bound by or obligated under any labor, collective
bargaining or union agreements.   Section 1.21 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR
EVENTS. Except as disclosed in the Representing Party\'s SEC Reports, since
December 31, 1999 (a) the businesses of the Representing Party and its
Subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course and (b) there has not been any event, occurrence, development or state
of circumstances or facts that has had, or is reasonably likely to have,

filing with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the   
21   Securities Act, and on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed

regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bidder makes no
representation or warranty with respect to the statements made in the
Registration Statement based on and in conformity with information supplied

warranties by the Company in this Agreement and the statements contained in
the schedules, certificates and other writings furnished and to be furnished

Section 1.24 TAX MATTERS.   (1) All federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Representing Party, each
affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group of which the Representing
Party is a member (an "Affiliated Group") have been timely filed or requests
for extensions have been timely filed and any such extension has been granted
and has not expired, and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate
except to the extent any failure to file or any inaccuracies in filed Tax
Returns would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party. All Taxes due and
owing by the Representing Party or any Representing Party\'s Affiliated   
22   Group have been paid, or adequately reserved for, except to the extent
any failure to pay or reserve for would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Representing Party. There is no audit or examination and there is no
deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy
with respect to any Taxes due and owing by the Representing Party or any
Representing Party\'s Affiliated Group which if determined adversely would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Representing Party. All assessments for Taxes due and
owing by the Representing Party or any Representing Party\'s Affiliated Group
with respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded litigation
have been paid, except to the extent that any failures to pay would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Representing Party.   (2) The Representing Party has
not (i) entered into a closing agreement or other similar agreement with a
taxing authority relating to Taxes of the Representing Party or any
Representing Party\'s Affiliated Group with respect to a taxable period for
which the statute of limitations is still open, or (ii) with respect to U.S.
federal income Taxes, granted any waiver of any statute of limitations with
respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any income
Tax, in either case, that is still outstanding. There are no Liens relating
to material Taxes upon the assets of the Representing Party or any
Representing Party\'s Affiliated Group other than Liens relating to Taxes not
yet due and Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Representing Party. Neither the Representing
Party, any Representing Party\'s Affiliated Group is a party to or is bound
by any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement
in respect of Taxes (other than with respect to agreements solely between or
among members of the consolidated group of which the Representing Party is
the common parent and agreements and obligations that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Representing
Party). Neither the Representing Party nor any Representing
Party\'s Affiliated Group has taken any action or knows of any fact,
agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent
either the Merger or the Life Technologies Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (3)
Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Tax Return of
the Company or any Affiliated Group for which an accurate copy of the actual

could give rise to a payment which is nondeductible by reason of Section 280G
of the Code.   (5) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Group
has received any private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
within the three-year period ending on the date hereof.   (6) Neither the

of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock (to any
Person or entity that is not a member of any Affiliated Group) qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) within the two-year
period ending on the date hereof or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the
Merger or the Life Technologies Merger.   (7) Neither the Company nor any
Affiliated Group is a party to any contract, agreement or other arrangement
which could result in the payment of amounts that would be nondeductible by
reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.   (8) For purposes of this Agreement:
(i) "Taxes" means any and all federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes
of any kind (together with any and all interest, penalties, additions to tax

holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock which is
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions

34   and all reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate every

Prior to making any application to or filing with a Governmental Entity or
other entity in connection with this Agreement (other than filing under the

the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by the Bidder or the
Company, as the case may be, or by any of their respective Subsidiaries, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 1.34 EMPLOYEE
MATTERS.   (1) The Company shall take all such actions as shall be
necessary to cause each outstanding stock option to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (including any related alternative rights) granted
under any stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Option Plans") (including those
granted to current or former employees and directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) (the "Employee Stock Options") to become fully vested
and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, as permitted
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Option Plan.
The Company shall take all such actions as shall be necessary to cause all
Employee Stock Options that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether or not then presently exercisable or vested) to be
cancelled. In exchange for the cancellation of each such Employee Stock
Option (whether or not presently exercisable or vested), the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive from the Company (A) an amount in cash equal to
the product of (1) the Option Value Spread multiplied by (2) 0.2800 and (B)
such number of shares of Bidder Common Stock (rounded to the nearest full
share) equal to product of (1) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
Option Value Spread by (y) Average Bidder Trading Price multiplied by (2)
0.7200. For purposes of this Agreement the "Option Value Spread" of an
Employee Stock Option shall mean the product of (A) the excess, if any, of
(x) the Cancellation Price over (y) the per share exercise price of
such Employee Stock Option multiplied by (B) the number of Shares subject to
such Employee Stock Option and not previously purchased upon exercise of such
option. Any such payment shall be further reduced by any income Tax or
employment Tax witholding required under the Code. The "Cancellation Price"
shall    35   be the dollar amount equal to the sum of (i) $17.50 and
(ii) the product of (A) 0.7200 and (B) the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by (y) the Average Bidder Trading Price. The Company shall take
such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Section 4.6(a) and any other dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby by any individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. The Bidder shall take such steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.6(a) and any other
acquisitions of Bidder equity securities (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by any
individual who is or becomes at or before Closing a director or officer of
the Bidder to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
The steps to taken by the Company and the Bidder in connection with the
exemption under Rule 16b-3 described above shall be taken in accordance with
the interpretative letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.   (2) Following the Effective
Time, and to the extent not provided for in an acquisition agreement that the
Company is a party to as of the Effective Time, or any agreement entered into
after the Effective Time by the Company and/or the Bidder with any purchaser
of the Company\'s coatings business or any other assets of the Company, the
Bidder shall, or shall cause a Bidder Subsidiary to, (i) provide to those
former employees of the Company whose employment terminated prior to the
Effective Time (and eligible dependents of such former employees)
(collectively, "Retirees") post-retirement welfare benefits substantially
equivalent (both in terms of the benefits provided and the cost of such
benefits to a Retiree) to those provided to such individuals under the post-
retirement welfare benefit program of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) continue an arrangement pursuant to which
such post-retirement welfare benefits shall be provided upon any termination
of employment with the Bidder or a Bidder Subsidiary, to those employees (and
their eligible dependents) who elect to receive such benefits (substantially
in accordance with the procedures utilized by the Company or other such
reasonable procedures the Bidder may establish) and who immediately prior to
the Effective Time would be eligible for such benefits upon a termination of
employment with the Company (collectively, "Vested Eligible Employees") and
(iii) continue an arrangement pursuant to which such post-retirement welfare
benefits shall be provided to those individuals (and their eligible
dependents) who are not Retirees or Vested Eligible Employees, and who, as of
the Effective Time, had attained the age of 50 and had been credited with at
least five years of service with the Company (collectively, "Potential Grow-
In Employees"), but only    36   if, at the time of termination of any
termination with the Bidder or a Bidder Subsidiary, (A) such Potential Grow-
In Employee would have been eligible to receive such post-retirement welfare
benefits under the Company\'s post-retirement welfare benefit program as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (crediting service with the
Bidder or a Bidder Subsidiary as service with the Company) and (B) such
Potential Grow-In Employee elects to receive such benefits (substantially in
accordance with procedures currently utilized by the Company or other such
reasonable procedures the Bidder may establish). The Bidder shall not, and
shall not permit any Bidder Subsidiary to, terminate or modify in any adverse
manner the post-retirement welfare benefit it has agreed to provide to
Retirees, Vested Eligible Employees and Potential Grow-In Employees pursuant
to this Section 4.6(b).   (3) At the direction of the Bidder, and to the
extent permissible under any previous acquisition agreement entered into by
the Company, the Company shall terminate the Dexter Corporation 401(k) Plan
and or the Employees\' Savings and Profit Sharing Retirement Income Plan of
Dexter Corporation and Dexter Corporation, Nonwoven (collectively, the
"Savings Plans"). The Bidder shall determine whether any such previous
acquisition agreement would affect the proposed plan terminations and shall
notify the Company at least three (3) days prior to the Closing of its
decision to, and may at that time, terminate a Savings Plan. Unless the
Bidder has not so directed the Company, the Bidder shall receive from the
Company evidence (in a form satisfactory to the Bidder) that the Savings Plan
shall be terminated effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing. The Bidder shall, consistent with the terms of the Bidder\'s 401(k)
plan, and applicable law, allow individuals who were employees of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing to
participate in the Bidder\'s 401(k) plan and the Bidder shall cause its
401(k) plan to accept direct rollovers and rollover contributions (each, to
the extent requested by a Savings Plan participant) in respect of the Savings
Plan account balances (including any outstanding loans) held by such
individuals.   Section 1.35 TAKEOVER STATUTE. If any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-
takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of the Company and the Bidder and the members of
their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.  
Section 1.36 NO SOLICITATION BY THE COMPANY.    37    (1) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of
any of them shall, and the Company shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and
representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
being the "Company Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly through
another Person, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise knowingly
facilitate any inquiries (by way of furnishing information or otherwise) or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions
or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Company\'s Board of Directors may, or may authorize the
Company Representatives to, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith is, or
is reasonably likely to become, a Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person making such
Superior Proposal and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Superior Proposal, PROVIDED that, prior to taking any such
action, the Company provides reasonable advance notice to the Bidder that it
is taking such action. For purposes of this Agreement "Acquisition Proposal"
means any direct or indirect inquiry, proposal or offer relating to the
acquisition or purchase of a business or shares of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction (a "Business Combination Transaction") involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any purchase or sale of a substantial portion of
the consolidated assets (including without limitation stock of Subsidiaries
owned directly or indirectly by the Company) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (an "Asset Transaction"); PROVIDED that the term Acquisition
Proposal shall not include the Loctite Acquisition Agreement, the Ahlstrom
Acquisition Agreement or communications relating to the sale of any business
covered by any such agreement or the Company\'s coatings business.
For purposes of this Agreement "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s legal
and financial advisors) would, if consummated, provide greater aggregate
value to the Company\'s shareholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED that for purposes of
this definition the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set
forth above, except that (x) references to "shares of any class of equity
securities of the Company" shall be deemed to be references to "100% of the
outstanding Shares" and    38   (y) an "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to refer only to a Business Combination Transaction involving the
Company or, with respect to an Asset Transaction, such transaction must
involve the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
not any Subsidiary of the Company alone.   (2) Except as expressly permitted
by this Section 4.8, neither the Company\'s Board of Directors nor any
