            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 16, 2008 (this

            WHEREAS, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall form a new wholly owned subsidiary ("Merger Sub") as a Delaware
corporation, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, sign a
joinder agreement to this Agreement and be bound hereunder;

            WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Company and Parent have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into
Company (the "Merger"), with Company as the surviving company in the Merger
(sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Company");

            WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to the entrance of Parent
into this Agreement, Company is granting to Parent an option pursuant to a stock
option agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit A (the "Option Agreement");

            WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   THE MERGER

            1.1 The Merger. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this

            1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

            1.4 Conversion of Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

            (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00, of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

            (b) All shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the

and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are

indirectly, by Company or Parent in respect of a debt previously contracted (any
such shares, "DPC Common Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist
and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Shares of Company Common Stock held by any wholly-owned subsidiary of
Company or Parent (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common
Shares), shall be appropriately adjusted into shares of common stock of the

            (c) Subject to Section 1.4(e), each share of the Company Common
Stock, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Parent
(other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares), shall be
converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, into the
right to receive 0.05473 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (the "Merger
Consideration").

            (d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu
of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section
2.3(f), as well

capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the

whole penny) equal to the exercise price for each such share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, that, in the case of any Company Option
to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent

Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share) (a "Parent RSU"). The obligations in

compensation program or any individual deferred compensation agreements
(collectively, the "Company Deferred Equity Unit Plans") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into deferred equity units, on the same terms and conditions (including

Unit"). The obligations in respect of the Parent Deferred Equity Units shall be
payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the Company Deferred
Equity Unit Plan relating to such Parent Deferred Equity Units.

            (e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations

reasonably acceptable to


                                       5
<PAGE>

Company, or Parent's transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the "Exchange
Agent Agreement") to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") hereunder.

            2.2 Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) authorize the Exchange Agent to issue an aggregate number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration,
and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited with, the Exchange Agent, to the
extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.3(f) (the "Exchange Fund").

            2.3 Delivery of Merger Consideration.

            (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates)) to the
Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other
provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the "Letter
of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(c).

            (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or
Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a
holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the
Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or
Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after
the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without
interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

            (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case
unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such
surrender date) and with a


                                       6
<PAGE>

payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to such Certificate.

            (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of Company, the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration
shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate
formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment
or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of
(x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or
termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be,
and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case
may be.

            (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

            (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect
to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former
stockholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the
closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the
"NYSE") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days
immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a
share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.


                                       7
<PAGE>

            (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be
paid to Parent. In such event, any former stockholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

            (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Common Stock, Parent Preferred Stock, Voting Debt of Parent or any other equity
securities of Parent or any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Preferred Stock,

with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were
required to file since January 1, 2005 and prior to the date hereof with the
Regulatory Agencies and each other applicable Governmental Entity, and all other
reports and statements required to be filed by them since January 1, 2005 and

relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to

material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published

GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. As of the date hereof, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Parent's system of internal accounting controls.

<PAGE>

            4.9 Approvals. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent knows of no
reason why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for

be obtained on a timely basis.

            5.3 Parent Forbearances. Except as expressly permitted by this
Agreement or with the prior written consent of Company, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provision of the Parent Certificate or the Parent Bylaws in a manner that would
adversely affect Company, the stockholders of Company or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (b) take any action or willfully fail to take
any action that is intended or may reasonably be expected to result in any of
the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied; (c)
take any action that would be reasonably expected to prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (d) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any
resolutions of its board of directors in support of, any of the actions
prohibited by this Section 5.3.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

            6.1 Regulatory Matters. (a) Parent and Company shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company shall thereafter mail or
deliver the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company
and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

            (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties (including any unions, works councils or
other labor organizations) and Governmental Entities that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities. Company and Parent shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each
case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information,
all the information relating to Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

<PAGE>

            (c) Each of Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish to the
other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (d) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval
of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or Company Requisite
Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval may be materially delayed.

            (e) The Company shall cooperate fully with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts from and after the date hereof to promptly apply for and seek all
necessary approvals for Parent to exercise supervision and control, commencing
as promptly as possible following the date hereof, over the business and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including their prime brokerage
and clearing operations and investment advisory relationships).

            6.2 Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such party
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance laws (other
than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request (in the case
of a request by Company, information concerning Parent that is reasonably
related to the prospective value of Parent Common Stock or to Parent's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby). Neither Company nor Parent,
nor any of their Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

            (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the parties as of March 13, 2008 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

            (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this
Agreement.

            6.3 Stockholder Approval. Company shall call a meeting of its
stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required in connection with the
Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon
as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the stockholder vote
approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the
stockholder meeting even if its Board of Directors shall have withdrawn,
modified or qualified its recommendation. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of Company has adopted resolutions approving the Merger, on
substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
directing that the Merger, on such terms and conditions, be submitted to
Company's stockholders for their consideration.

            6.4 NYSE Listing. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

            6.5 Employee Matters. (a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall
maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively
employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date ("Covered
Employees") that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities which,
in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its
Subsidiaries), as applicable; provided, that in no event shall any Covered
Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or
its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that until such time as Parent shall cause
Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly situated employees of Parent
or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered
Employee's continued participation in employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in
the Parent plans may commence at different times with respect to each Parent
plan).

            (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such
employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with
Company or its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual under such employee
benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such
service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such
recognition of service (A) shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service and (B) shall not
apply for purposes of (1) any plan, program or arrangement under which
similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service, (2) "retirement" eligibility under Parent's equity
compensation plans and arrangements, (3) eligibility for subsidized
post-retirement, medical or


                                       25
<PAGE>

life insurance and (4) grandfathering and/or the level of pay credits under
Parent's defined benefit retirement plan or subsidized retiree medical benefits,
and (ii) with respect to any health, dental, vision plan or other welfare of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in
which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which
such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility
waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect
to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any
health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year
that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health,
dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as
of the date hereof or as may be amended or terminated after the date hereof with
the prior written consent of Parent, each employment agreement and change in
control agreement to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and the
obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each
deferred compensation plan or agreement to which they are a party.

            (d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the
right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination
is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 6.5 be construed to require the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to retain
the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Closing Date.

            (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, the provisions
of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any
other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed
as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for
any purpose.

            (f) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing
reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company
employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP"), any or all Company 401(k) plans, any or
all Company profit sharing plans and any other qualified plans of the Company to
be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the request
of Parent, termination of the ESOP will include taking any such action as Parent
may reasonably determine to repay each loan thereunder.

            (g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Benefit Plans" means
each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not
subject to ERISA, and each employment, consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred
compensation, vacation, stock option or other equity-


                                       26
<PAGE>

based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-sharing,
fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether
written or unwritten, for the benefit of any employee, former employee, director
or former director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into,
maintained or contributed to by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute, or with respect
to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, direct or
indirect, contingent or otherwise (including any liability arising out of an
indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or similar agreement) or otherwise
providing benefits to any current, former or future employee, officer or
director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to any beneficiary or
dependant thereof.

            6.6 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

            (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a
"Claim"), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or who is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director or officer of another person (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a
director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the
parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time or taken at the request of Parent pursuant to
Section 6.7 hereof, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall
require any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Surviving Company.

            (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause
the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in
part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring
or alleged to have occurred, or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of
Parent pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof.


                                       27
<PAGE>

            (c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time
by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by Company
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in
their capacity as such; provided that in no event shall Parent be required to
expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Company for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"),
and provided, further, that if Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or such
substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

            (d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

            6.7 Additional Agreements. (a) In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent,
on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parent's
sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by
Parent.

            (b) Subject to the availability of funds, the Company shall and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to reimburse within 2 business days after payment
thereof all amounts paid by Parent pursuant to the Guaranty (as hereinafter
defined). Any such amounts paid by Parent shall accrue interest from the time of
such payment at a rate per annum equal to 3% over the "prime rate" (as announced
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association) in effect on the date that such
amounts were originally required to be paid.

            6.8 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and Company shall each take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom, LLP.

            6.9 No Solicitation.

            (a) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director,
employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage,
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action
designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share
exchange,


                                       28
<PAGE>

consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way
of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction
(any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals, including the indication of any
intention to propose any of the foregoing, being referred to herein as an
"Alternative Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding
any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of Company shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Company
stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with
the other terms of this Section 6.9 (including but not limited to the preceding
sentence) and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person
proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no
less favorable to Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations and
provide information with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal received by
Company, if and only to the extent that and so long as the Board of Directors of
Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties to Company stockholders under applicable law.

            As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means any of
(i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than
Parent or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire
more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock
that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to a merger with
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether from Company or pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange,
consolidation or other business combination involving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which
any person (or group of persons) (other than Parent or its affiliates) acquires
or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
equity securities of subsidiaries of Company and securities of the entity
surviving any merger or business combination including any of Company's
Subsidiaries) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 15%
of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (b) Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
48 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such request that does not relate to and would not
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of
the person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering
making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to
the books and records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and a copy (if in
writing) and summary of the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal. Company shall keep Parent
fully informed, on a current


                                       29
<PAGE>

basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or
request. Company shall also provide Parent 24 hours written notice before it
enters into any discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal
in accordance with Section 6.9(a).

            (c) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
(other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than Parent who
have been furnished confidential information regarding Company in connection
with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within
the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such
information. Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to,
release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of
any agreement to which Company or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and
shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may
have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to
make an Alternative Proposal. Neither Company nor the Board of Directors of
Company shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any
Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction Section 203 of the DGCL or any
similar Takeover Statutes.

            (d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.9(d), neither
the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, the
recommendation by the Board of Directors of Company of this Agreement and/or the
Merger to Company's stockholders, (ii) take any public action or make any public
statement in connection with the meeting of Company stockholders to be held
pursuant to Section 6.3 inconsistent with such recommendation or (iii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or fail to recommend
against, any Alternative Proposal (any of the actions described in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii), a "Change of Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Board of Directors of Company may make a Change of Recommendation, if, and only
if, each of the following conditions is satisfied:

                  (i) it receives an unsolicited Alternative Proposal that
      constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not been
      withdrawn;

                  (ii) Company has not breached any of the provisions set forth
      in Section 6.3 or this Section 6.9;

                  (iii) it reasonably determines in good faith (after
      consultation with outside legal counsel), that in light of a Superior
      Proposal the failure to effect such Change of Recommendation would cause
      it to violate its fiduciary duties to Company stockholders under
      applicable law;

                  (iv) Parent has received written notice from Company (a
      "Change of Recommendation Notice") at least five business days prior to
      such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall (1) state expressly that
      Company has received a Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors
      of Company has determined is a Superior Proposal and that Company intends
      to effect a Change of Recommendation and


                                       30
<PAGE>

      the manner in which it intends or may intend to do so and (2) include the
      identity of the person making such Alternative Proposal and a copy (if in
      writing) and summary of material terms of such Alternative Proposal;
      provided that any material amendment to the terms of such Alternative
      Proposal shall require a Change of Recommendation Notice at least two
      business days prior to such Change of Recommendation; and

                  (v) during any such notice period, Company and its advisors
      have negotiated in good faith with Parent to make adjustments in the terms
      and conditions of this Agreement such that such Alternative Proposal would
      no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

            As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any proposal
made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or 100% of the assets, net revenues or net income of Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is otherwise on terms which the
Board of Directors of Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel),
taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, that the
proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more
favorable, from a financial point of view, to Company's stockholders than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably
capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which is
then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.

            (e) Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives) of Company
or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.9
as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.9 by any officer,
director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.9 by Company.

            (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall prohibit Company or
its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            6.10 Restructuring Efforts. If Company shall have failed to obtain
the requisite vote or votes of its stockholders for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its
stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms, each of the parties
shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring
of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party
shall have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration, or the tax treatment of the Merger, in a manner adverse to such
party or its stockholders) and to resubmit the transaction to


                                       31
<PAGE>

Company's stockholders for approval, with the timing of such resubmission to be
determined at the reasonable request of Parent.

            6.11 Asset Option. In consideration of entering into this Agreement
and the Guaranty attached hereto as Schedule 6.12, the Company hereby grants, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, to Parent, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 6.11, the irrevocable right and option to
acquire all of the Company's and its Affiliates' rights, title and interest
(free and clear of all encumbrances) in and to the Company's headquarters
building located at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York (the "HQ Property")
for an amount in cash equal to the RE Consideration (as defined below) (the
"Asset Option"). As used herein, "RE Consideration" shall mean $1.1 billion
minus (x) the amount of the indebtedness or other encumbrances or liabilities to
which the HQ Property is subject (provided that any such indebtedness,
encumbrances or liabilities described in this clause (x) shall only be deducted
to the extent Company has not paid and satisfied such indebtedness, encumbrances
or liabilities in full prior to the closing of Parent's or its designee's
acquisition of the HQ Property) and (y) any reasonable transaction costs
incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in completing the transaction. The Asset
Option shall only be exercisable if this Agreement is terminated either (x) by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or 8.1(f), or (y) (i)(A) by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) or (B) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c), and (ii) prior to either such termination an Alternative Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to Company
(or any person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an
intention to make an Alternative Proposal), and shall not have been irrevocably
withdrawn; in any such case the Asset Option shall be exercisable at Parent's
discretion from the time of such termination until the date that is six months
following the date of such termination. If the Asset Option is exercised, the
Company shall promptly take (and cause its applicable Affiliates to take) all
necessary actions to vest in Parent or its designee, subject to receipt of the
RE Consideration, all right and title, free and clear of all encumbrances, to
the HQ Property, including as applicable stock certificates, real property
transfer documents and any other documents reasonably requested by Parent. The
Company further agrees to cooperate (and cause its applicable Affiliates to
cooperate) with Parent, and to cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent,
in taking all actions necessary to facilitate any exercise or consummation of
the Asset Option, including with respect to obtaining any necessary government,
regulatory or third-party approvals. If Parent exercises the Asset Option, then,
if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
exercise the option to purchase the HQ Property pursuant to Section 14 and the
other provisions of the Amended and Restated Lease, dated as of August 28, 2003,
between ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., as Lessor, and Gregory/Madison Avenue LLC (a
subsidiary of the Company), as Lessee (the "HQ Lease"), and take all actions
required to acquire the HQ Property under the HQ Lease and simultaneously convey
the HQ Property to Parent or its designee in the manner requested by Parent. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions and enter
into all agreements directed by Parent that are necessary to consummate the
foregoing transactions and to convey to Parent or its designee good, marketable
and insurable fee simple title to the HQ Property (free and clear of all
encumbrances) by special warranty deed and otherwise as directed by Parent. The
Company and its Affiliates shall exercise their best efforts to obtain any
consents or waivers required to effectuate the foregoing transactions. All
transfer taxes and other costs of consummating the foregoing transactions shall
be borne by the Company. The closing of Parent's or its designee's acquisition
of the HQ


                                       32
<PAGE>

Property shall occur within 30 days of the exercise of the option or within such
other period as shall be directed by Parent.

            6.12 Guaranty. Parent has entered into as of the date hereof the
Guaranty set forth on Schedule 6.12 and shall comply with the terms of such
Guaranty, subject to the conditions set forth therein.

            6.13 Tax Matters. Company shall consult with Parent (including in
connection with the preparation of Company's 2007 federal income tax return)
regarding Company's utilization of tax losses and any issues that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to creation of or increase in "net operating
loss" carryforwards, and shall, in Company's reasonable discretion, take account
of Parent's views on such matters to the extent reasonably feasible.

            8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Company:

            (a) by mutual consent of Company and Parent in a written instrument
authorized by the Boards of Directors of Company and Parent;

            (b) by either Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity that
must grant a Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or a Company Requisite
Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become
final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction or decree
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

            (c) by either Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

            (d) by either Company or Parent (provided that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by Company, which
breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 30 days
following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured within such time period;

            (e) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of Company shall have

Agreement, (B) made any Change of Recommendation, (C) approved or recommended,
or publicly proposed to approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, whether
or not permitted by the terms hereof or (D) failed to recommend to Company's
stockholders that they reject any tender offer or exchange offer that
constitutes an Alternative Transaction within the ten business day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act, (ii) Company shall have breached
its obligations under Section 6.9 in any material respect adverse to Parent or
(iii) Company shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 in any
material respect by failing to call, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders in accordance with Section 6.3; or

            (f) by either Company or Parent, if its Board of Directors
determines in good faith that the other party has substantially engaged in bad
faith in breach of its obligations under Section 6.10.

provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

            8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Company, Parent, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
(i) Sections 6.2(b), 6.11, 8.2, 8.3, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.10
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) neither Company nor
Parent shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out
of its knowing breach of any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Option
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the extent provided therein.

            8.3 Fees and Expenses. Except with respect to costs and expenses of
printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid to
the SEC in connection with the Merger, which shall be borne equally by Company

Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

            8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by
the stockholders of Company; provided, however, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of Company,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment
of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties.

            8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf
of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Article
or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise

interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." All schedules and exhibits hereto, shall be
deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.
This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any person to

applicable law. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in
this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to


                                       38
<PAGE>

be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and
covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If
for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any provision,
covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the express
intention of the parties that such provision, covenant or restriction be
enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

            9.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not
sign the same counterpart.

            9.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and
the instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement.

            9.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts made and wholly-performed within such state, without
regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto agree
that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties
hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from
present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party
hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

            9.8 Publicity. Neither Company nor Parent shall, and neither Company
nor Parent shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to,
or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or
statement by Company, or Company, in the case of a proposed announcement or
statement by Parent; provided, however, that either party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to
the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication
of any press release or other public announcement to the extent required by law
or by the rules and regulations of the NYSE.

nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be

to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section
6.6, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement. In no event shall
any obligations of Parent hereunder or under any other agreement entered into in
connection herewith (including but not limited to the Guaranty) be deemed to
relieve any insurer or other third party from any obligation with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors, officers or
employees.

            9.10 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law
or equity.
