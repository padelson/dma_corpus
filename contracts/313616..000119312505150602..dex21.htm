shall not be required to notify Parent or Buyer of the identity of the party

any confidentiality, process or other similar process agreement relating to
any Superior Proposal.



For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Offer" means any unsolicited offer
to all of the shareholders of the Company to acquire all of the Shares on
terms and conditions that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment, after due consideration of its fiduciary duties, (as
advised by its advisors) to be superior for the Companys shareholders when
compared as a whole with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
provided such offer is at a price that on a fully diluted basis is not lower
than that offered by Buyer and on conditions no more restrictive on the offer
than the Offer Conditions.



For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited
written proposal that contemplates a Superior Offer and that the Board of
Directors of the Company (having consulted with its financial and legal
advisors) reasonably believes is likely to result in a Superior Offer.

---|--- 



The Company shall not permit or provide access to non-public information
relating to the Company and its subsidiaries to any third party other than

Proposal or publication of a Superior Offer from such party or other than as
required by Swiss law or imposed by the Swiss Takeover Offer Board. In the
event that such access is provided or permitted in accordance with the
foregoing, such access shall be provided on terms and subject to conditions no

Buyer in connection with the Offer within the meaning of Art. 24 para.

Offers ("TOO"). Consequently, Buyer may be required pursuant to Art. 10 para.
6 TOO (the "Best Price Rule") to increase the Offer Price if the Company, its
subsidiaries, affiliates or representatives acquire equity securities of the
Company at a price exceeding the Offer Price. Considering this, the Company
shall abstain (and shall procure that its subsidiaries, affiliates
and representatives acting on behalf of the Company abstain) from any action
that may be found to be in breach of the Best Price Rule, and in particular
from:



     | (ii) | entering into any (a) agreement (either on or off exchange)
relating to the acquisition or sale of Shares and (b) derivative transaction
having the Shares as underlying; and

stock options or derivatives issued by the Company, its subsidiaries,
affiliates or representatives without Parents prior written consent.

Pending completion of the Offer, Parent and Buyer may from time to time
request access to the Companys officers and directors with a view
to discussing integration plans, such access to be made available at the
Companys discretion, but not unreasonably denied or delayed by the Company.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, access shall not be
deemed to be unreasonably denied or delayed if such denial or delay is
required by applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Following completion
of the Offer, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries, and each of
their respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the
"Company Representatives") to, give Parent and its respective officers,
employees, counsel, advisors and representatives (collectively, the "Parent
Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
assets, properties, offices and other facilities and to the books and records
of the Company and its subsidiaries and will cause the Company Representatives
and the Companys subsidiaries to furnish Parent with such financial and
operating data, access to customers and suppliers and such other information
with respect to the business and operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably request and to
the extent permitted under Swiss law. The Company shall furnish promptly to
Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document publicly filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries during such
period. Parent agrees that any information furnished pursuant to this Section
will be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

The Company shall promptly, upon request, enter into its share register the
Buyer or, as the case may be, the Parent or any of the Parents subsidiaries,
as a shareholder with voting rights in respect of all Shares that the Buyer
or, as the case may be, the Parent or any of the Parents subsidiaries, may
own at the time the request is made.



   4.8 | _Trading in Shares and related securities by Parent and Buyer_

---|--- 



If the Offer is declared successful and Buyer so requires, the Board of
Directors shall promptly convene a general meeting of shareholders to be held
as soon as practicable with such agenda and proposals that shall have been
submitted by Buyer, to the extent legally permissible.



   4.11 | _Confirmation relating to material adverse change_ 
---|--- 



The Board of Directors of the Company shall provide Buyer and Parent at least
two trading days prior to the Offer Expiration Date, a confirmation that
to the best of their knowledge as of the date of such confirmation no adverse
events have occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, are or are likely
to be material to the Leica Group within the meaning of Section 6(ii) of this
Agreement. 



   4.12 | _Resignation of the members of the Board of Directors of the
Company_ 
---|--- 



In the event that the Offer is declared successful, the current members of the
Board of Directors of the Company will resign as per the
shareholders meeting to be convened pursuant to Section 4.10. Upon
completion of the Offer, Buyer and Parent will offer to each member of the
Board of Directors a customary mandate agreement covering the period between
completion of the Offer and this shareholders meeting and Buyer and Parent
will procure that discharge is granted to these members of the Board of
Directors by the ordinary shareholders meeting for the fiscal year 2005/2006.
