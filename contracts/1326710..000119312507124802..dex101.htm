_KL Acquisition_ "), representing a 100% equity interest in KL.

WHEREAS, following the Closing, SHA will be renamed as China Kelun
Pharmaceutical Corporation.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE KL ACQUISITION

conditions hereof, at the Closing (as defined in Section 2.01), the KL
Shareholders shall sell, transfer, assign and convey to SHA, and SHA shall

the KL Shareholders in and to the KL Shares representing all of the registered
capital of KL.



 

1 Section 1.02 _Purchase Price; Payment Schedule_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the aggregate
purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") to be paid by SHA to the
KL Shareholders or their designees for the KL Shares shall consist of the
following:

(i) up to 29,000,000 SHA Ordinary Shares (the " _Share Payment_ ") pursuant
to Section 1.02(b)(i) and Section 1.02(b)(ii); and

(ii) US$11,500,000 to be paid pursuant to Section 1.02(b)(iii) below,
provided that the condition stated in such section is satisfied (" _Cash
Payment_ ").

(b) Subject to Section 1.04 below, the Purchase Price shall be paid in the
following manner:

(i) Initial Share Payment. At the Closing,

(A) SHA shall deliver to each KL Shareholder the number of SHA Ordinary Shares
set forth in the column entitled "Initial Share Payment" of _Schedule A_
opposite his/her name, issued in the name of such KL Shareholder, for an
aggregate of 20,000,000 SHA Ordinary Shares (the " _Initial Share Payment_ "):

(B) If the FY2006 Combined Net Profit is less than RMB113,000,000 by ten
percent (10%) or more, SHA shall have to right to re-negotiate with KL
and the KL Shareholders the aggregate number of SHA Ordinary Shares to be
delivered under Section 1.02(b)(i)(A); otherwise, there will be no adjustment
to the aggregate number of SHA Ordinary Shares to be delivered under Section
1.02(b)(i)(A). 

(C) Any adjustment made to the Initial Share Payment pursuant to Section
1.02(b)(i)(B) above shall be applied pro rata to the KL Shareholders as set
forth in Schedule A.

(ii) _Earn-Out Share Payments_. If SHA achieves or exceeds the Targeted Net

receive, and SHA shall issue and deliver, the number of SHA Ordinary Shares

" _Earn-Out Shares_ ") within sixty (60) days following the delivery of the

with US GAAP. The aggregate number of Earn-Out Shares to be awarded to the KL

the number of issued SHA Ordinary Shares resulting from a share split, reverse
share split, share dividend, combination or reclassification of the SHA
Ordinary Shares or similar transaction affecting the SHA Ordinary Shares
occurring prior to the date of actual award or (b) any other increase or
decrease in the number of issued SHA Ordinary Shares effected prior to the
date of issuance of such without receipt of consideration by SHA occurring

exercise of any option or share appreciation right or other right convertible
or  



 

2  exchangeable into SHA Ordinary Shares granted under such Equity Incentive
Plan, (ii) any issuance of SHA Ordinary Shares as a result of the exercise
of any Warrant, (iii) any issuance of SHA Ordinary Shares as a result of the
exercise of the Unit Purchase Option or as a result of the exercise of the
warrants issued as a result of the exercise of the Unit Purchase Option, or
(iv) any issuance of SHA Ordinary Shares in respect of share options
previously granted by SHA as disclosed in Section 4.02(a)(ii) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(iii) _Cash Payment_. Following the Closing, within sixty (60) calendar days

at least seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding Warrants have been
exercised by the holders thereof and (B) SHA sending the notice of redemption
to the holders of the outstanding Warrants to exercise its right to redeem the
Warrants pursuant to the Prospectus, SHA shall pay in aggregate to a bank
account designated by the KL Shareholders Representative (the " _Designated
Account_ ") US$11,500,000. Each KL Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the payment made to the Designated Account pursuant to this section
shall be deemed as satisfying in full the payment obligation under Section
1.02(a)(ii) above.

Section 1.03 _Payment of Cash Purchase Price_. All Cash Payments under
Section 1.02 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available United
States dollars to the Designated Account.

Section 1.04 _Withholding_. If SHA is required under any provision of
applicable PRC or foreign tax Laws to deduct and withhold any amounts with
respect to the making of the payment of the Purchase Price, SHA shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the payment of the Purchase Price such
amounts as required, provided that (a) copies of such provisions of applicable
PRC or foreign tax Laws are provided to the KL Shareholders and (b) such
payment is actually made to the applicable Governmental Authorities and copies
of receipts of which are provided to the KL Shareholders upon their request.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts will be treated

acting on behalf of SHA) shall be entitled to seek preliminary injunctive
relief, if possible, from any court of competent jurisdiction pending the
constitution of the arbitral tribunal.
