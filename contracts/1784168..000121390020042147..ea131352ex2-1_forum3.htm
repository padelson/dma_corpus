Parent shall pay to each former holder of Parent Common Stock or Stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Reference Price, by (ii) the fraction
of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive pursuant to this <U>Article II</U>. For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of any cash in lieu of fractional

to which such former holder of Parent Common Stock or Stockholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and not
with respect to the conversion of each share of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, respectively. For illustrative purposes
only, if, pursuant to this Agreement, a Stockholder would be entitled to 1.5 shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for each
share of Company Common Stock held by such Stockholder, and such Stockholder holds 11 shares of Company Common Stock, such Stockholder
would be entitled to cash in lieu of .5 shares of Parent Common Stock (i.e., 16.5 minus 16).</P>

setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing

thirty (30)-day period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed to the Closing Balance Sheet and

by Parent and the Stockholder Representative (such firm, subject to the following proviso, the &ldquo;<B><I>Accounting Referee</I></B>&rdquo;).

its determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably possible (which the Parties agree should not be later
than thirty (30) days following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Accounting Referee). The Accounting Referee
shall base its determination solely on (i) the written submissions of the Parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation

remaining disagreements submitted to the Accounting Referee) in order to be determined in accordance with <U>Section 2.7 </U>(including
the definitions of the defined terms used in <U>Section 2.7</U>), and the Parties shall instruct the Accounting Referee to make
all determinations in accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement. The Accounting Referee may not assign a value
greater than the greatest value for a disputed item claimed by either Party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The date on
which Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash are finally determined in accordance with this <U>Section 2.7(c)</U> is hereinafter
referred to as the &ldquo;<B><I>Determination Date.</I></B>&rdquo; All fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee relating to

as between Parent and the Stockholder Representative (as set forth in the written submissions to the Accounting Referee) made by
the Accounting Referee such that the Party prevailing on the greater dollar value of such disputes pays the lesser proportion of
the fees and expenses. For example, if the Stockholder Representative challenges items underlying the calculations of Closing Date
Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash in the net amount of $1,000,000, and the Accounting Referee determines that Parent has a valid
claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Parent shall bear sixty percent (60%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee
and the Stockholder Representative shall bear the remaining forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee.</P>

the ability of Parent to consummate the Transactions.</P>

Trust Account</U></B>. As of the Execution Date, Parent has no less than $250,000,000 in the account established by Parent for
the benefit of its stockholders at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the &ldquo;<B><I>Parent Trust Account</I></B>&rdquo;),
such monies being invested in U.S. Government treasury bills or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in trust pursuant to that certain Investment Management
Trust Agreement, dated as of August 18, 2020, between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, as trustee (the
&ldquo;<B><I>Parent Trust Agreement</I></B>&rdquo;). The Parent Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and has not been amended or modified. Parent has
complied in all material respects with the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder
and there does not exist under the Parent Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a breach or default by Parent or the trustee under the Parent Trust Agreement (the &ldquo;<B><I>Trustee</I></B>&rdquo;).
There are no separate Contracts, side letters or other arrangements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied) that would cause the description of the Parent Trust Agreement in the Parent Reports to be inaccurate in any material
respect or that would entitle any Person (other than pursuant to a Parent Share Redemption or with respect to the Deferred Discount
(as defined in the Parent Trust Agreement)) to any portion of the proceeds in the Parent Trust Account. There are no proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to the Parent Trust Account. Upon the consummation of the Merger
and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Parent Trust Agreement, Parent shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall
thereupon be obligated to, release to Parent as promptly as practicable, the funds in the Parent Trust Account in accordance with
the Parent Trust Agreement at which point the Parent Trust Account shall terminate; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
liabilities and obligations of Parent due and owing or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due,
including all amounts payable: (a)&nbsp;to stockholders of Parent who shall have exercised applicable redemption rights; (b)&nbsp;with
respect to filings, applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement required under Law; and (c)&nbsp;to the
Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with the Parent Trust Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, the conditions
to the use of funds in the Parent Trust Account will be satisfied and the funds available in the Parent Trust Account will be
available to Parent at the Effective Time.</P>

Investments</U></B>. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the Execution Date true, correct and complete copies of
the Subscription Agreements. As of the Execution Date, each Subscription Agreement (a)&nbsp;is in full force and effect without
amendment or modification; (b)&nbsp;is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent or its applicable Affiliate and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto (except, in any case, as may be limited by Bankruptcy and Equity Exception);

any PIPE Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to affect the obligations of the PIPE
Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment set forth in the Subscription Agreements, and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no facts or circumstances exist that may reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions
set forth in any Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment not being available to Parent, on the Closing
Date. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part
of Parent, or to the Knowledge of Parent, on the part of any PIPE Investor, under any material term or condition of any Subscription
Agreement, and, as of the Execution Date, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy in all material respects,
on a timely basis, any term or condition of Closing to be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription Agreement. The Subscription
Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents)
to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment set forth in the
Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.</P>

Parent and Merger Sub (a)&nbsp;have prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) all income and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax
Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects and accurately reflect all liability for Taxes of Parent and Merger
Sub for the periods covered thereby; (b)&nbsp;have paid all income and all other material Taxes that are required to be paid,
except with respect to current Taxes not yet due and payable or otherwise being contested in good faith; and (c)&nbsp;have not
waived any statute of limitations with respect to material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material
Tax assessment or deficiency. Any such Taxes or Tax liabilities of Parent and Merger Sub that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
that are not yet due and payable (i) for periods covered by the financial statements included in the Parent Report have been properly
accrued and adequately disclosed on such financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) for periods not covered by such
financial statements have been properly accrued on the books and records of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with GAAP. All
material Taxes that Parent and Merger Sub are (or were) required by Law to withhold or collect in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, member or other Person have been duly withheld or collected,
and have been timely paid over to the proper authorities to the extent due and payable. As of the Execution Date, there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened in writing, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings
in respect of material Taxes or Tax matters of Parent or Merger Sub. To the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, there are no unresolved
questions or claims concerning the Parent&rsquo;s or Merger Sub&rsquo;s Tax liability that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party to or bound by any Tax
Sharing Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub (A)&nbsp;have not been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal
income Tax Return for which the statute of limitations is open (other than a group the common parent of which was Parent); and
(B)&nbsp;do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person under Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Parent and Merger Sub have
not been, within the last two years or otherwise as part of a &ldquo;plan (or series of related transactions)&rdquo; within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a &ldquo;distributing corporation&rdquo; or a &ldquo;controlled
corporation&rdquo; (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify
for tax-free treatment under Section&nbsp;355 of the Code. Parent and Merger Sub have not participated in a &ldquo;reportable
transaction&rdquo; within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections&nbsp;1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five years
has Parent or Merger Sub been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section&nbsp;897(c)(2) of
the Code. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.</P>

Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of the Transactions, including the power: (A) to take

Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the covenants and agreements contained in <U>Section 1.1</U> (collectively the
&ldquo;<B>Non-Competition and Related Covenants</B>&rdquo;) relate to matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary value;
(ii) the Company has one or more legitimate business interest justifying enforcement in full of the Non-Competition and Related
Covenants, including for the protection of the goodwill of the business acquired by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and
the Non-Competition and Related Covenants are reasonable and narrowly tailored to protect the compelling interests of Parent, the
Company and the Business; (iii) a breach by the Restricted Party of any of the Non-Competition and Related Covenants will result
in irreparable harm and damages that may not be adequately compensated by a monetary award and, accordingly, the Company will be
entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or redress any such breach (without posting a bond or other security);
(iv) pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Restricted Party will receive valuable consideration (including, as applicable, significant
benefits, equity in Parent, and other valuable consideration), both directly or indirectly, from Parent in connection with the
Merger; and (v) the Non-Competition and Related Covenants are intended to comply with the Laws of all jurisdictions that might
be deemed to be applicable hereto and which restrict or otherwise limit the enforceability of a Contract that restrains a Person
from engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the restrictions contained in <U>Section
1.1</U> shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of their extending for too great
a period of time or over too great a geographical area of by reason of their being too extensive in any other respect, <U>Section
1.1</U> shall be modified to be effective for the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable and over the maximum geographical
area as to which it may be enforceable and to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable. Parent
and the Restricted Party hereby consent and agree to any such reformation of the restrictions to the maximum of enforceability
as determined by any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

Due to Disability or Death.</U> The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the Employee&rsquo;s employment,

Amounts through the date of such termination due to death or Disability. The term &ldquo;<U>Disability</U>&rdquo; as used in this

disability plan or, if there is no such plan, the Employee has incurred (1) a permanent and total disability within the meaning

the Employee unable to perform the required functions of the Employee&rsquo;s position, duties, and responsibilities under this

5.2(c), if the Employee timely and properly elects health continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985 (&ldquo;<U>COBRA</U>&rdquo;), the Company shall reimburse the Employee for the difference between the monthly COBRA
premium actually paid by the Employee for the Employee and the Employee&rsquo;s dependents and the monthly premium amount paid
by similarly-situated active executives of the Company during the same period. Such reimbursement shall be paid to the Employee
in the month immediately following the month in which the Employee timely remits the premium payment and the Employee provides
proof of payment of such premium. The Employee shall be eligible to receive such reimbursement until the earliest of: (i) the end
of the Severance Period; (ii) the date the Employee is no longer eligible to receive COBRA continuation coverage; and (iii) the
date on which the Employee becomes eligible to receive substantially similar coverage from another employer or other source. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to provide a cash payment to the Employee in lieu of providing reimbursement
as described herein in an amount reasonably determined by the Company to be equivalent to the amount of COBRA premium reimbursements
that would otherwise be due by the Company under this Section 5.6 for the Severance Period, without regard to any effect of taxation
of such cash payment to the Employee. If the Employee obtains other employment prior to the end of the Severance Period which offers
any of such insurance coverage, the Company&rsquo;s obligation to reimburse the Employee for COBRA payments will be immediately
terminated. The Employee agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all documentation required and/or reasonably requested by the
Company regarding subsequent benefit eligibility.</P>

not have entered into this Agreement had the Employee not agreed to the restrictions set forth in Section 7 of the Agreement. The

the Employee from any such breach. The Employee further consents and stipulates to the entry of such injunctive relief without

a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information
in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and does not disclose the
trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with federal law protecting confidential
disclosures of a trade secret to the government or in a court filing, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1833(b), or to create liability for disclosures

the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware unless said court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction in which case the Superior Court of the State of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation&rsquo;s stockholders,
(c) any action asserting a claim arising under any provision of the DGCL, this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or the Bylaws or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through
(d) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within
ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
to the contrary, unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts
of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
to the contrary, the provisions of this Section A of this Article VII will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability
created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than a court
located within the State of Delaware (a &ldquo;<B><I>Foreign Action</I></B>&rdquo;) in the name of any stockholder, then such stockholder
shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of
Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (ii) having service of process
made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder&rsquo;s counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for
such stockholder.</P>

otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person&rsquo;s capacity as a director
of the Corporation, such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise
be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue, and to the extent the director is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation

Holder&rsquo;s Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose (after Pre-Closing Holder or any of Pre-Closing Holder&rsquo;s
Representatives have used their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure and after promptly advising and consulting
with the Company and Parent about their intention to make, and the proposed contents of, such disclosure) any Company Confidential
Information (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process),
(1) provide the Company and the Parent with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Company and the Parent may seek
a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this <U>Section 4</U> and (2) in the event that such protective order
or other remedy is not obtained, or the Company and the Parent waive compliance with this <U>Section 4</U>, furnish only that portion
of such Company Confidential Information that is legally required to be provided or to avoid sanction for contempt or any similar
sanction, in each case, as advised in writing by outside counsel, and to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such Company Confidential Information so disclosed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that Pre-Closing Holder is already subject to confidentiality obligations to the Company which are in effect
as of the Closing Date which provide that such confidentiality obligations are the sole confidentiality provisions with respect
to the Company applicable to Pre-Closing Holder, then those confidentiality obligations will apply to Pre-Closing Holder in lieu
of the provisions of this <U>Section 4</U>. &ldquo;<B><I>Company Confidential Information</I></B>&rdquo; means any and all confidential,
proprietary documents, information or trade secret information of or pertaining to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives, their business, or affairs, as well as any and all information entrusted to the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in confidence by third parties, in each case, whether disclosed, directly
or indirectly, verbally, in writing or by any other means in tangible or intangible form, including that which is made, created,
authored, discovered, developed, invented, conceived, or reduced to practice (&ldquo;<B><I>Created</I></B>&rdquo;) by Company and/or
its Subsidiaries, Pre-Closing Holder, or any of their respective Representatives. Company Confidential Information includes, without
limitation, all Company Developments, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, improvements, research, product or service ideas
or plans, software (whether in source code or object code), designs, developments, processes, formulas, techniques, materials,
specifications, mask works, design, drawings, hardware configuration information, information relating to existing or potential
employees, consultants, clients, suppliers, vendors, or other service providers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives (including, but not limited to, their names, contact information, jobs, compensation and expertise), information
relating to suppliers and customers, servicing methods, equipment, programs, or strategies, information relating to stockholders
or lenders, price lists, pricing methodologies, cost data, market share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information,
business plans, financial forecasts, financial statements, profit margins, sales information, historical financial data, budgets
or other business information. Confidential Information also means all similar information disclosed to the Company by third parties,
which is subject to confidentiality obligations. For purposes hereof, (a) &ldquo;<B><I>Development</I></B>&rdquo; means any invention,
modification, idea, discovery, design, development, improvement, process, software, work of authorship, documentation, formula,
data, technique, know-how, trade secret, trademark, technology, or other intellectual property whatsoever or any interest therein
(whether or not patentable, copyrightable, or otherwise registrable under similar statutes or subject to analogous protection)
(together with all intellectual property rights therein or arising therefrom); and (b) &ldquo;<B><I>Company Development</I></B>&rdquo;
means any Development that Company, solely or jointly with others, Creates, including as such Development relates to or result
from the actual or anticipated business, work, products, services, research, or strategies of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of its Representatives or which are suggested by, relate to, or result from any task assigned to or performed for the benefit
of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, this <U>Section 4</U> shall not restrict
any Pre-Closing Holder from performing his or her duties as an officer, director or employee of the Company.</P>
