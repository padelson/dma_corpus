the part of the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of the Company,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for (x) the number of

if payable subject to and in accordance with _Section 2.7_ (such right, the "

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or any holder of any capital stock of the Company, all of the shares of
Company Common Stock shall represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ , shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate formerly representing any of the shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately

capacity as such, which sets forth: (i) a detailed capitalization schedule of
the Company, setting forth all Company Common Stock; (ii) a schedule of the

Company Common Stock held by such Stockholder), (B) the portion of the Stock
Merger Consideration required to be paid under the Company Certificate to each
Stockholder in respect of such Stockholder's Company Common Stock, and (C)

Company Certificate, the Convertible Notes and the requirements of the
DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to rely (without any duty of inquiry) upon the
Merger Consideration Schedule, and a Company Letter of Transmittal shall be
required to be delivered by each Stockholder as a condition to receipt of any
Merger Consideration and shall include a waiver of, among other things, any
and all claims (i) that the Merger Consideration Schedule did not accurately
reflect the terms of the Company Certificate, and (ii) in connection with the
issuance of any Company Common Stock (including any rights to indemnities
from the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any Contract entered
into by such Stockholder in connection with such issuance).

  



  

(c) Parent shall be entitled to review and comment upon the Closing Date
Statement and the Merger Consideration Schedule delivered by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , and the Company shall consider Parent's
comments thereto in good faith (and, in the event of any such adjustments
based on the comment of Parent, all references in this Agreement to the
Closing Date Statement or the Merger Consideration Schedule shall be deemed
to be references to such documents after giving effect to such adjustments).

Company Certificate (as reflected in the Merger Consideration
Schedule). Subject to the post-Closing adjustments contemplated by and set

(b) the amount of Estimated Closing Date Cash, _plus_

  



  

(c) the Pre-Paid Company Transaction Expense Amount, _minus_

  



  

(d) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _minus_

  



  

(e) the Convertible Note Adjustment Amount, _minus_

transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (" _Company Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in receiving the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
held by such Stockholder. After the Effective Time, each Stockholder, upon
surrender of a Company Letter of Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor such portion of the Merger Consideration into which such
holder's Company Common Stock (as applicable) shall have been converted as a
result of the Merger (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without giving effect
to any Merger Consideration Adjustment). If any Stockholder's shares of
Company Common Stock are certificated, such Stockholder shall be required to
surrender and deliver to Parent all Certificates for such Company Common
Stock, or a duly completed affidavit of loss (in a customary form reasonably
acceptable to Parent) with respect to any lost, stolen, or destroyed
Certificate, together with such Stockholder's Company Letter of Transmittal,
before such Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_. Pending such
surrender of a Stockholder's Certificate(s), such Certificate(s) shall be
deemed for all purposes to evidence such Stockholder's right to receive
the portion of the Merger Consideration into which such Company Common Stock
shall have been converted as a result of the Transactions and pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued (whether in book-entry form or
otherwise) in exchange for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each
former holder of Parent Common Stock or Stockholder who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Reference Price, by
(ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the calculation of any cash in lieu of fractional shares
to be paid pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall be made with respect to the
aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock, to which such former holder of
Parent Common Stock or Stockholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant to
this Agreement, and not with respect to the conversion of each share of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, respectively. For illustrative
purposes only, if, pursuant to this Agreement, a Stockholder would be
entitled to 1.5 shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for each share of
Company Common Stock held by such Stockholder, and such Stockholder holds 11
shares of Company Common Stock, such Stockholder would be entitled to cash in
lieu of .5 shares of Parent Common Stock (i.e., 16.5 minus 16).

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, each remaining Stockholder and each record
holder of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat, and other similar Laws) as a general creditor thereof with respect
to such shares and warrants and dividends and distributions thereon to which
he, she, or it is entitled upon surrender of his, her, or its Certificates.

Section 2.7 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) The Merger Consideration may be increased or reduced as set forth in this
_Section 2.7_. Any increase or decrease in the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 2.7_ shall be referred to as a " _Merger Consideration
Adjustment_ ". Any payments made in respect of any Merger Consideration
Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes unless otherwise required by
any applicable Law.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholder Representative (A) an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Final Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), and (B) a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth Parent's good faith calculations of (with reasonable supporting detail):
(x) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company as of immediately
prior to the Closing on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Indebtedness_
") and, (y) the aggregate Cash of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Cash_ "), in each case,
calculated in accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement. The
Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the Accounting
Principles. From the Closing Date through the final determination and
delivery of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ , Parent
shall provide the Stockholder Representative and its
representatives reasonable access (during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice and at the sole cost and expense of the
Stockholder Representative) to the records, properties, personnel and
(subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if
requested) auditors of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the
preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and shall cause the personnel
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with the
Stockholder Representative in connection with its review of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to
provide any information the disclosure of which would violate applicable Law
(including competition or antitrust Law) or that would, based on the
advice of counsel, result in the waiver of attorney client privilege. If
Parent does not provide information pursuant to the proviso of the preceding
sentence, Parent will provide notice to the Stockholder Representative that
such information is being withheld and Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that will not violate the applicable privilege or applicable Law.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(c) If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with the calculations of
Closing Date Indebtedness and/or Closing Date Cash set forth in the Closing
Statement, it shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing (a "
_Disagreement Notice_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars
of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. If the Stockholder
Representative does not provide a notice of disagreement within such thirty
(30)-day period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall be deemed to
have agreed to the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of Closing Date
Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash set forth in the Closing Statement, which
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If any
Disagreement Notice is timely provided, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree)
to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations of Closing Date
Indebtedness or Closing Date Cash. If, at the end of such period, they are
unable to resolve such disagreements, then any such remaining disagreements
shall be resolved by Grant Thornton LLP or such other independent accounting
or financial consulting firm of recognized national standing as may be
mutually selected by Parent and the Stockholder Representative (such firm,
subject to the following proviso, the " _Accounting Referee_ "). Each of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly provide their
respective assertions regarding Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date
Cash and, to the extent relevant thereto, the Final Closing Balance Sheet in
writing to the Accounting Referee and to each other; _provided,_ that no
Party shall disclose to the Accounting Referee any settlement discussions (or
the contents thereof) between the Parties without the prior consent of the
other Party. The Accounting Referee shall be instructed to render its
determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably
possible (which the Parties agree should not be later than thirty (30) days
following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Accounting
Referee). The Accounting Referee shall base its determination solely on (i)
the written submissions of the Parties and shall not conduct an independent
investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which Closing Date Indebtedness
or Closing Date Cash require adjustment (only with respect to the remaining
disagreements submitted to the Accounting Referee) in order to be determined
in accordance with _Section 2.7_ (including the definitions of the defined
terms used in _Section 2.7_ ), and the Parties shall instruct the Accounting
Referee to make all determinations in accordance with the definitions set
forth in this Agreement. The Accounting Referee may not assign a
value greater than the greatest value for a disputed item claimed by either
Party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Party. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties. The date on which Closing Date Indebtedness and
Closing Date Cash are finally determined in accordance with this _Section
2.7(c)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date._ " All fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Accounting Referee hereunder shall be borne pro rata as
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the
other hand, in proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts
in dispute as between Parent and the Stockholder Representative (as set forth
in the written submissions to the Accounting Referee) made by the Accounting
Referee such that the Party prevailing on the greater dollar value of such
disputes pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses. For example, if
the Stockholder Representative challenges items underlying the calculations of
Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash in the net amount of
$1,000,000, and the Accounting Referee determines that Parent has a
valid claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Parent shall bear sixty percent
(60%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee and the Stockholder
Representative shall bear the remaining forty percent (40%) of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee.

  



  

(d) The " _Adjustment Amount,_ " which may be positive or negative, shall
mean (i) Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, minus Closing Date Indebtedness
(as finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_ ), _plus_ (ii)
Closing Date Cash (as finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_
), _minus_ Estimated Closing Date Cash. If the Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased by the
Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then
the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 2.7(e)_ or _Section 2.7(f)_ , as applicable.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following
the Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days after
the delivery by the Stockholder Representative of the updated Merger
Consideration Schedule required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.7(g)_
, (i) Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative for further
delivery to each Stockholder a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to (A) the Adjustment Amount, divided by (B) the Reference Price, and (ii)
the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to release from
the Escrow Account to the Stockholder Representative (for further delivery to
each Stockholder) all of the shares of Adjustment Escrow Stock; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be required
pursuant to subclause (i) to issue or deliver an amount of Parent Common
Stock that exceeds the quotient of the Adjustment Escrow Amount divided by
the Reference Price.

  



  

(f) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then, promptly following the Determination
Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination
Date, the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to
deliver, from the Escrow Account to Parent that number of shares of
Adjustment Escrow Stock that is equal to (A) the Deficit Amount divided by (B)
the Reference Price. If, after release of the Adjustment Escrow Stock to
Parent in accordance with the preceding sentence, any Adjustment Escrow Stock
remains in the Escrow Account, the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release such balance to the Stockholder Representative (for
further delivery to each Stockholder). The Adjustment Escrow Stock in the
Escrow Account shall be Parent's sole recourse for any Deficit Amount.

  



  

(g) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then within three (3)
Business Days after the Determination Date, the Stockholder
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Parent a certified update to the
Merger Consideration Schedule, prepared in accordance with the terms of the
Company Certificate (the " _Updated Merger Consideration Schedule_ "). The
Updated Merger Consideration Schedule shall give effect to the Merger
Consideration Adjustment, the Adjustment Amount and specify in detail the
portion of any such additional Parent Common Stock or released Adjustment
Escrow Stock that each Stockholder is entitled to receive as a result. The
Stockholder Representative, Parent and each of their respective agents and
Affiliates shall be entitled to rely (without any duty of inquiry) upon the
Updated Merger Consideration Schedule.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Parent Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock by the Parent pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to any officer, director or stockholder (by
reason of "director by deputization") of the Company or Parent who is
expected to become a "covered person" of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ")
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Tax Consequences of the Merger_. It is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that this Agreement be, and hereby is, adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and
within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the United States
Treasury Regulations (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ").

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

Section 2.10 _Earnout_.

  



  

(a) After the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Stockholders shall have the contingent right to receive additional
consideration from Parent based on the performance of Parent and its
Subsidiaries if the requirements as set forth in this _Section 2.10_ are
achieved. If during the thirty-six (36) month period following the Closing
Date (the " _Earnout Period_ "), the closing price per share of Parent Common
Stock on any twenty (20) trading days in any thirty (30) consecutive day
trading period (i) equals or exceeds Fourteen Dollars ($14.00) (the " _First
Share Price Trigger_ "), or (ii) equals or exceeds Sixteen Dollars ($16.00)
(the " _Second Share Price Trigger_ " and, together with the First Share
Price Trigger, each a " _Share Price Trigger_ " and collectively, the "
_Share Price Triggers_ ") then, for each Share Price Trigger that is
achieved, the holders of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall receive additional consideration (in accordance with
their Pro Rata Share) from Parent (each, an " _Earnout Release_ ") of Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand (2,500,000) shares of Parent Common
Stock released from the Escrow Account (which shall be equitably adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like
that occur after the Closing and prior to the relevant Earnout Release)
(collectively, the " _Earnout Shares_ "). For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the holders of Company
Common Stock shall have the right to receive no more than two Earnout
Releases, an Earnout Release may only be achieved once with respect to any
Share Price Trigger and the aggregate sum of all Earnout Releases issuable
hereunder (assuming both Share Price Triggers are achieved), shall be a
maximum of Five Million (5,000,000) shares of Parent Common Stock in the
aggregate (which shall be equitably adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like that occur after the
Closing and prior to the relevant Earnout Release).

  



  

(b) If, during the Earnout Period, there is a Change of Control, then any
Earnout Release that has not previously been released from escrow to the
Stockholder Representative (whether or not previously earned) shall be deemed
earned (and the applicable Share Price Trigger(s) achieved, as applicable);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Earnout Release shall be deemed earned (and
the applicable Share Price Trigger(s) achieved, as applicable) only (i) if
such Change of Control has been approved by a majority of the
independent directors on the Parent Board; and (ii) to the extent the price
per share of Parent Common Stock in the Change of Control exceeds the
applicable Share Price Trigger. Upon such Change of Control if applicable,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow
Agent to release from the Escrow Account to Stockholder Representative a
number of shares equal to such remaining Earnout Release(s) within ten (10)
Business Days following the date of such Change of Control.

  



  

(c) If, during the Earnout Period, there is a Final Determination in
accordance with this _Section 2.10_ that the Stockholders are entitled to
receive a Earnout Release, then Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to
Stockholder Representative a number of shares equal to such Earnout Release
within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the applicable
Share Price Trigger was met or exceeded.

  



  

(d) With respect to any Earnout Shares that have not been released during the
Earnout Period pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ within five (5) Business Days
following the date that it is finally determined that the Stockholders are not
entitled to or eligible to receive any further Earnout Releases under this
Agreement, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly direct the
Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to Parent for immediate
cancellation all such Earnout Shares that have not been released.

(v) copies of customary payoff letters in connection with the repayment of

11

accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

  



  

(iv) shares of Parent Common Stock to the holder(s) of each Convertible Note

(viii) any other document reasonably requested by the Company to be delivered
by or on behalf of Parent at Closing.

  



  

(d) _Payment of Other Amounts at Closing_. At the Closing, Parent:

  



  

(i) shall, on behalf of the Company, pay or cause to be paid to such account
or accounts as the Company specifies to Parent pursuant to the Closing Date
Statement, the Company Transaction Expenses for which invoices have been
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)(v)_  above which have not been paid
prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that any Company Transaction Expenses
payable to any director, officer or employee of the Company (including any

Indebtedness, with the result that immediately following the Closing there
will be no further monetary obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to such Funded Indebtedness outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing.

Article III _ 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

  



  

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to the Execution
Date (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent with respect to the Company as of the Execution Date and
as of the Closing (or in the case of representations and warranties that speak
of a specified date, as of such specified date) as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company (a)
is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (b) has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted; and (c) is
qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept is applicable, is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except in
the case of clause (b) and (c) where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, could not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent prior to the Execution Date complete and
correct copies of the Company's Organizational Documents and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Capital Structure_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, of which 100,000 shares were issued and outstanding,
and no shares of Company Common Stock were issued and held by the Company in
its treasury.

  



  

(b) All of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not
subject to any preemptive rights, anti-dilution, down-valuation or similar
rights. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations, the holders of which have the right to vote (or convert
into or exercise for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. Except for this Agreement and the
Company's Organizational Documents, the Company Common Stock is not subject
to any voting trust agreements, proxies, or other Contracts with respect to
the voting, purchase, repurchase, dividend rights, disposition or transfer of
the shares of Company Common Stock. The Company is not party to any Contract
that provides for any preemption, anti-dilution, down-valuation or similar
protections in respect of Company Common Stock or Parent Capital Stock.

  



  

(c) _Section 3.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
correct (i) description of the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by each Stockholder as of the Execution Date and that will be held by each
Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)
description of the principal amount of each Convertible Note held by each
Convertible Note Holder as of the Execution Date.

  



  

(d) The Company has no Subsidiaries, and does not directly or indirectly own
or hold any: (i) equity interests, including any partnership, limited
liability company or joint venture interests, in any other Person; (ii)
securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity interests of any other
Person; or (iii) options or other rights to acquire equity interests of any
other Person.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Section 3.3 _Authority; Approval_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and, subject to
receipt of the Initial Stockholder Consent, perform its obligations under this
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. This
Agreement has been, and each of the Transaction Documents to which the Company
is a party will be at Closing, duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, when executed and delivered by the Parent and the other parties hereto
and thereto, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, preferential transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law) (the "
_Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

  



  

(b) The Company's board of directors has, at a duly convened and held
meeting, unanimously determined that the Merger is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. Other than the Initial
Stockholder Consent, no other approvals are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions. The Company's board of directors
has taken all necessary action to ensure that Parent will not be an
"interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a
"business combination" with the Company (in each case, as such term is used
in Section 203 of the DGCL), as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions in the manner contemplated hereby. No
Takeover Statute is applicable to the Company, the Company Common Stock or the
Transactions.

  



  

(c) The Initial Stockholder Consent, upon delivery to the Company as provided
in Section 228 of the DGCL and subject to the notice requirements thereof,
shall be sufficient to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger on behalf
of the Company pursuant to Delaware Law.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Governmental Filings; No Violation; Certain Contracts_.

  



  

(a) Other than the expirations of waiting periods and the filings, notices,
reports, consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations under
the HSR Act, any applicable requirements under applicable securities Laws, and
the DGCL, no expirations of waiting periods under applicable Antitrust Laws
nor any notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the
Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents by the Company or
the consummation of the Transactions, or in connection with the continuing
operation of the business of the Company immediately following the Execution
Date, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not, and the
consummation of the Transactions will not, conflict with, or result in any
breach or violation of or default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to any right of termination, loss of rights, adverse
modification of provisions, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
under, or result in the creation of a Lien (except for any Permitted Lien) on
any of the assets of the Company under any provision of (i) the
Organizational Documents of the Company; (ii) any Contract; or (iii) assuming
(solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and consummation of the Transactions) compliance with the matters
referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ any Laws to which the Company is subject,
except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ above, for any breach,
violation, default, termination, loss, adverse modification, cancellation,
acceleration or creation that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 3.4(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list
of Material Contracts pursuant to which consents, notices or waivers are or
may be required prior to consummation of the Transactions (whether or not
subject to the exception set forth with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii)
above).

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Correct and complete copies of the following financial statements have
been made available to Parent or its Representatives prior to the Execution
Date: (i) the audited combined carve-out balance sheets of the ECV Operations
as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and the related audited
combined carve-out statements of (A) operations and comprehensive loss, (B)

Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which they are a party do not, and
the consummation of the Transactions will not, conflict with, or result in any
breach or violation of, or default (with or without notice, lapse of time or
both) under, or give rise to any right of termination, loss of rights, adverse

under, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or
Merger Sub under any provision of (i) their respective Organizational
Documents; (ii) any Contract binding upon Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective properties or assets; or (iii) assuming (solely with respect
to performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and
consummation of the Transactions) compliance with the matters referred to in 
_Section 4.4(a)_ , any Law to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject, except,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such breach, violation,

Company copies, in the form filed with the SEC, of all Parent Reports. As of
their respective dates of filing (and, if amended, as of the date of filing
such amendment), no Parent Report contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date

requirements by virtue of Parent's status as an "emerging growth company"
within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012, Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in paragraph (e)
of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act.

Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act.

  



  

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows
included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of operations,
changes in stockholders' equity, cash flows, retained earnings (loss) and
changes in financial position, as applicable, of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that
will not be material in amount or effect), in each case prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein or in the notes thereto and comply in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and with the rules and regulations
of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act in effect as of the
respective dates thereof.

financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
under the Exchange Act that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(f) (i)  To the Knowledge of Parent, the Parent has not identified or been
made aware of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal controls that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information for inclusion in the applicable financial statements;
and (ii) since the date of Parent's formation, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the Parent has not identified or been made aware of any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves the management or other employees of Parent who have a

controls or auditing matters have been received by Parent.

Section 4.7 _Litigation and Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) There are no Actions pending, threatened in writing, or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, otherwise threatened, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(and no Governmental Entity has notified Parent of its intention to initiate
an Action), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Since its date of incorporation, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
carried on any business or conducted any operations other than: (i)
directed towards the accomplishment of a business combination; and (ii) the
execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it
is a party, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
matters ancillary thereto. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any obligations
or liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unknown or otherwise),
other than liabilities that (i) have been adequately reserved against or
reflected in the financial statements included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and
schedules); (ii) were incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and which are not material; or (iii) have been incurred as
expressly required by this Agreement. Parent is not a party to or subject to
the provisions of any Order that restricts the manner in which Parent conducts
its business except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.8 _Parent Trust Account_. As of the Execution Date, Parent has no
less than $250,000,000 in the account established by Parent for the benefit
of its stockholders at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the " _Parent
Trust Account_ "), such monies being invested in U.S. Government treasury
bills or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and
held in trust pursuant to that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement,
dated as of August 18, 2020, between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, as trustee (the " _Parent Trust Agreement_ "). The Parent
Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and
has not been amended or modified. Parent has complied in all material
respects with the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement and is not in breach
thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist under the Parent Trust
Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default by Parent or the trustee under the
Parent Trust Agreement (the " _Trustee_ "). There are no separate Contracts,
side letters or other arrangements or understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of the Parent
Trust Agreement in the Parent Reports to be inaccurate in any
material respect or that would entitle any Person (other than pursuant to a
Parent Share Redemption or with respect to the Deferred Discount (as defined
in the Parent Trust Agreement)) to any portion of the proceeds in the Parent
Trust Account. There are no proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened with respect to the Parent Trust Account. Upon the
consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the
Parent Trust Agreement, Parent shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee
shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Parent as promptly as
practicable, the funds in the Parent Trust Account in accordance with the
Parent Trust Agreement at which point the Parent Trust Account shall
terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the liabilities and obligations of
Parent due and owing or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be
paid as and when due, including all amounts payable: (a) to stockholders of
Parent who shall have exercised applicable redemption rights; (b)
with respect to filings, applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to
this Agreement required under Law; and (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs
incurred in accordance with the Parent Trust Agreement. Assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company herein and the
compliance by the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, the
conditions to the use of funds in the Parent Trust Account will be satisfied
and the funds available in the Parent Trust Account will be available to
Parent at the Effective Time.

Section 4.9 _PIPE Investments_. Parent has made available to the Company
prior to the Execution Date true, correct and complete copies of the
Subscription Agreements. As of the Execution Date, each Subscription Agreement
(a) is in full force and effect without amendment or modification; (b) is the
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent or its applicable
Affiliate and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto (except,
in any case, as may be limited by Bankruptcy and Equity Exception); and (c)
have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. There are no
other Contracts between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to any
Subscription Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to affect the
obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable
portion of the PIPE Investment set forth in the Subscription Agreements,
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no facts or circumstances exist that may
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any
Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment not being
available to Parent, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent, or to the Knowledge of Parent, on the part of any PIPE
Investor, under any material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement,
and, as of the Execution Date, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy in all material respects, on a timely basis, any term or
condition of Closing to be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription
Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions
precedent (other than the conditions contained in this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute
to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment set forth in
the Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.

  



  

Section 4.10 _[RESERVED]_.

  



  

Section 4.11 _Investment Intent_. Parent is acquiring the Company Common
Stock solely for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Parent
acknowledges that the Company Common Stock is not registered under the
Securities Act, any state securities Laws or any other applicable securities
Laws, and that the shares of Company Common Stock may not be transferred or
sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act
or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state
securities Laws and regulations and any other applicable securities Laws, as
applicable.

  



  

Section 4.12   _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective directors or employees (including
any officers), as applicable, has employed any investment banker, broker or
finder or has incurred or will incur any obligation or liability for any
brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees or other similar payments in
connection with the Transactions.

  



  

   

40

 



    



  

Section 4.13 _Information Supplied; Proxy Statement_. The information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will not, (a) at the time
the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of Parent, (b) at the
time of the Parent Special Meeting to be held in connection with the
Transactions after giving effect to any supplements or updates to the Proxy
Statement, and (c) at the Effective Time after giving effect to any
supplements or updates to the Proxy Statement, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on
information that was supplied by the Company or its Representatives expressly
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

  



  

Section 4.14 _Taxes_. Parent and Merger Sub (a) have prepared in good faith
and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within
which to file) all income and all other material Tax Returns required to be
filed by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate
in all material respects and accurately reflect all liability for Taxes of
Parent and Merger Sub for the periods covered thereby; (b) have paid all
income and all other material Taxes that are required to be paid, except with
respect to current Taxes not yet due and payable or otherwise being contested
in good faith; and (c) have not waived any statute of limitations with
respect to material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a
material Tax assessment or deficiency. Any such Taxes or Tax liabilities of
Parent and Merger Sub that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that are not
yet due and payable (i) for periods covered by the financial statements
included in the Parent Report have been properly accrued and adequately
disclosed on such financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) for
periods not covered by such financial statements have been properly accrued
on the books and records of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with GAAP.
All material Taxes that Parent and Merger Sub are (or were) required by Law
to withhold or collect in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, member or other
Person have been duly withheld or collected, and have been timely paid over
to the proper authorities to the extent due and payable. As of the Execution
Date, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub,
threatened in writing, audits, examinations, investigations or other
proceedings in respect of material Taxes or Tax matters of Parent or Merger
Sub. To the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, there are no
unresolved questions or claims concerning the Parent's or Merger Sub's Tax
liability that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub is a party to or bound by any Tax Sharing Agreement. Parent and Merger
Sub (A) have not been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return for which the statute of limitations is open (other
than a group the common parent of which was Parent); and (B) do not have any
liability for the Taxes of any person under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Parent and Merger Sub
have not been, within the last two years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or
series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Parent and Merger Sub have not participated in
a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections
1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five years has Parent or Merger
Sub been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning
of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of
any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent
the Merger from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

Section 4.15 _Material Contracts_. Except for those Contracts filed (or
incorporated by reference) as exhibits to the Parent Reports and except for
the documents to be executed by Parent in connection with the PIPE Investment
and the other Transactions, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
party to any Contract that would be required to be filed (or incorporated by
reference) as an exhibit to Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Benefit Plans_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
maintains, sponsors or contributes to, or has any actual or
contingent obligation or liability under, any Plan (including, without
limitation, any multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code), nor does Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have
any obligation or commitment to create or adopt any Plan, except as
contemplated pursuant to _Section 5.14_ of this Agreement. For purposes of
this section only, " _Plan_ " shall have the same meaning as "Benefit Plan",
except that references to the "Company" shall be replaced with "Parent".

  



  

Section 4.17 _Compliance with Laws_. Parent has, at all times since its
incorporation, been and is in compliance in all material respects with
all Laws and Orders applicable to it or to its businesses or operations.
Parent has not received any written notice or, to the Knowledge of Parent,

interest to pay any Tax obligation owed by Parent as a result of assets owned

to the trustee of the Parent Trust Account (the " _Parent Trustee_ ") and the
satisfaction of the requirements for release set forth in the Parent Trust
Agreement, the Parent Trustee shall be obligated to release as promptly as
practicable any and all amounts still due to holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock who have exercised their redemption rights with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock, and, thereafter, release the remaining funds in
the Parent Trust Account to Parent to be reflected on Parent's consolidated
balance sheet and the Parent Trust Account shall thereafter be terminated.

  



  

(b) _Trust Account Waiver_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i)
Parent is a blank check company with the power and privileges to effect a
merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination
involving the Company and one or more businesses or assets; and (ii) Parent's
sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of Parent's initial public offering
and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of these
proceeds have been deposited in the Parent Trust Account for the benefit of
Parent's public stockholders until the Closing. For and in consideration of
Parent entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Company on behalf of itself and any of its managers,
directors, officers, affiliates, members, stockholders and trustees, hereby
irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they have
or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Parent Trust Account, and
agrees not to seek recourse against the Parent Trust Account or any funds
distributed therefrom in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as a
result of, or arising out of, any claims against Parent arising under this
Agreement (it being agreed that such waiver shall automatically
terminate without further action by any party hereto at the Closing and shall

reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Trustee to pay as and when due

Common Stock sold in Parent's initial public offering who shall have validly

rescinded such election) pursuant to Parent's Organizational Documents and

Section 5.5 _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC; and (ii) promptly
notify the other of, cooperate with each other with respect to and respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(b) After all the comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC
staff and all information required to be contained in the Proxy Statement has
been included therein by Parent and the Company, Parent shall file the Proxy
Statement in definitive form with the SEC in accordance with the rules and
regulations under the Exchange Act and mail the Proxy Statement to holders of
record of Parent Common Stock, as of the record date to be established by the
board of directors of Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish
all information concerning such Party and its Affiliates to the other Party,
and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement, and the Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably
requested by such other Party to be included therein. The Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of the receipt of all comments (written or oral)
from the SEC and of any request (written or oral) by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to the Company copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to responding to any comments or
requests from the SEC, Parent will make available to the Company drafts of any
such response and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such drafts (including the proposed final version of such document
or response);  _provided_ , that Company shall be required to provide any
comments on such drafts reasonably promptly (but in no event later than the
end of the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Company's receipt thereof).

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will provide its respective legal counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy
Statement and other documents related to the Parent Special Meeting or the
Parent Stockholder Proposals, prior to filing such documents with the
applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the stockholders
of Parent. Each Party will include in the Proxy Statement and such other
documents related to Parent Special Meeting all comments reasonably and
promptly proposed by the other Party or its legal counsel and each agrees
that all information relating to Parent and Merger Sub included in the Proxy
Statement shall be in form and content satisfactory to Parent, acting
reasonably, and all information relating to the Company included in the Proxy
Statement shall be in form and content satisfactory to the Company, acting
reasonably.

  



  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of the information
supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, as of the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Parent Stockholders, at the
time of the Parent Special Meeting, or at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the Parent Special Meeting there shall be discovered any
information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly transmit to its
stockholders an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement containing
such information. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
discovers any information, event or circumstance relating to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors or
employees that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, then the Company shall promptly inform
Parent of such information, event or circumstance and shall promptly provide
all information required for Parent to transmit to the holders of its capital
stock an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement containing such
information.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(e) The Company shall provide Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
with all information (including applicable financial statements prepared in
accordance with Regulation S-X of the SEC to the extent required by applicable
SEC rules and regulations) concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
ECV Operations as required by the SEC or as reasonably requested by Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement (if any). The Company shall cause the officers and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to be reasonably available to Parent and its
counsel in connection with the drafting of the Proxy Statement and responding
in a timely manner to comments on the Proxy Statement from the SEC.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Parent Meeting_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and its Organizational
Documents, all action necessary to convene the Parent Special Meeting as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC advises it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ ") (and
will commence the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Parent Stockholders
as promptly as practicable after the SEC Clearance Date and schedule such
meeting for a date that is no more than thirty-five (35) days after the Proxy
Statement is mailed), to (i) consider and vote upon the approval of the
Parent Stockholder Proposals and to cause such vote to be taken; and (ii)
provide Parent Stockholders with the opportunity to elect to effect a Parent
Share Redemption. Parent may only elect to postpone or adjourn such meeting
on one or more occasions if (x) a postponement or adjournment is required by
Law, (y) as of the time for which the Parent Special Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares
of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting
to approve the Parent Stockholder Proposals or to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Special Meeting or (z) Parent
determines the payments for the Parent Share Redemption could reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions in _Section 6.1(d)_ to not be satisfied at
the Closing; _provided_ , that in the event of a postponement or adjournment
pursuant to clauses (x) or (y) above, the Parent Special Meeting shall be
reconvened as promptly as practicable following such time as the matters
described in the applicable clause have been resolved. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies as promptly
as possible in favor of the Parent Stockholder Proposals and shall include in
the Proxy Statement the Parent Board Recommendation; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to compliance by Parent, its
Affiliates and their Representatives with _Section 5.15(b)_ , at any
time prior to obtaining approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposals, the
Parent Board may fail to make, amend, change, withdraw, modify, withhold or
qualify the Parent Board Recommendation (any such action, a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") if the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and
without any violation by Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives of _Section 5.15(b)_ , that a failure to make a Change in
Recommendation would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
following such Change in Recommendation the obligation to solicit proxies in
favor of the Parent Stockholder Proposals shall terminate; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Parent Board may not make such Change in Recommendation
unless (1) the Parent Board has provided prior written notice to the Company
(a " _Parent Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect a
Change in Recommendation at least ten (10) Business Days prior to taking such
action, which notice shall specify the basis for such Change in
Recommendation, (2) during the five (5) Business Day period after delivery of
the Parent Recommendation Change Notice, the Company may propose to Parent
any revisions to this Agreement that the Company proposes to make and Parent
will engage in good faith discussions with the Company regarding such
proposal(s), (3) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period and taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in
writing by the Company, the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the
failure to make such a Change in Recommendation would constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to Parent Stockholders under applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, a Change in Recommendation will not affect Parent's
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ (other than as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence) or elsewhere in this Agreement.

following approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposals, Parent shall

Documents, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Required Stockholder Approval_. In accordance with applicable
Laws, and the Company's Organizational Documents, promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall seek and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (a) as promptly as practicable, and in any

Agreement (the " _Stockholder Support Delivery Period_ "), the Initial
Stockholder Consent; and (b) as promptly as practicable, Support Agreements
from Stockholders holding 100% of the Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the Execution Date, in each case, in lieu of a meeting
pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL for the purposes of (i) adopting this
Agreement and approving the Merger; (ii) acknowledging that the adoption and
approvals are irrevocable and result in the waiver of any right of such
stockholders to demand appraisal in connection with the Merger pursuant to
Delaware Law; and (iii) such other matters set forth therein. As promptly as
practicable and, in any event, prior to the expiration of the Stockholder
Support Delivery Period, if the Initial Stockholder Consent is obtained, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy thereof (including by facsimile or
other electronic image scan transmission), certified as correct and
complete by an executive officer of the Company.

at the same time as any Support Agreement is solicited from any
Stockholder (other than the Initial Stockholder Consents), the Company shall
prepare (with the cooperation of Parent) and mail to each Stockholder an
information statement regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent (as it
may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Information
Statement_ "). If applicable, the Information Statement shall constitute an
information statement for the Company's solicitation of consent of the
Stockholders with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger and shall include (a) a statement to the effect that the
Company's board of directors had unanimously recommended that the Stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger; and (b) such other information as Parent and the Company reasonably
agree is required or advisable under applicable Law to be included therein.
The Company shall, with the cooperation of Parent (to the extent reasonably
required), prepare any other necessary documentation required or advisable to
be provided to Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent or the Company for inclusion in the
Information Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto will contain, as
of the date of the delivery of such document, any untrue statement of a
material fact, or will omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

Section 5.10 _Regulatory Filings/Approvals_.

  



  

(a) _Exchanging Information_. The Company and Parent shall each, upon request

any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions.

  



  

(b) _Initial Submissions_. The Company and Parent shall prepare and file as
promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable

(d) _Conduct of Interactions with Government Entities_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to
direct all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its
obligations under this _Section 5.10_ ;  _provided_ , that Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all the information relating
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In
exercising the foregoing rights, the Company and Parent shall act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. With regard to any sharing of information
contemplated under this  _Section 5.10(d)_ , (i) any disclosure of
information shall be been done in a manner consistent with applicable Law;
(ii) information may be withheld as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client privilege concerns or comply with contractual obligations; (iii) any
Party, as it deems advisable or necessary to address reasonable

shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to
participate in any pre-scheduled meeting with any Governmental Entity in

Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions contained in
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use (and shall cause their
responsive controlled Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take any and all steps and actions necessary or advisable to avoid
or eliminate as promptly as possible each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Laws that may exist, arise or be asserted by any antitrust or
competition or any other Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to
enable the Parties to close the Transactions as promptly as possible, and in
any event prior to the Outside Date.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, including _Section 5.11(a)_ , shall require
Parent or any of its Affiliates to proffer to, agree to, or sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold
separate, before or after the Closing, any assets of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates (or consent thereto), where such action or
agreement would be reasonably likely to (i) give rise to a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) have an adverse impact that is material to the business
of Parent and the business of the Company, taken as a whole; provided that,
any such action or agreement required of Parent or any of its Affiliates is
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(g) Parent shall pay fifty percent (50%), and the Company shall pay fifty
percent (50%), of the filing fees in connection with the HSR Act
(collectively, the " _Merger Agreement HSR Fees_ ") required in connection
with this Agreement, but not, for avoidance of doubt any regulatory filing
fees payable under or in connection with any Key Contract which fees shall be
borne solely by the Company; _provided_ , that, at the Closing, Parent shall
reimburse the Company for such fifty percent (50%) of the Merger Agreement
HSR Fees paid by the Company.

other of any failure of any condition to the other Party's obligation to
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.11_ shall not affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any Party or update the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable.

delayed). The Parties shall each, upon request, furnish the other Party with
all information concerning itself and its Representatives and such
other matters as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of the Parties to any third party in connection with obtaining any
third-party consents (including, in the case of Parent, such evidence as to
financial capability, resources, and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought hereunder).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates be
required to make any payments, incur any liability, commence any litigation,
amend, supplement or otherwise modify any Contract, or make any concessions
or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing to obtain any consents of third
parties contemplated by this _Section 5.12_ , and the failure to receive any
such consents shall not be taken into account with respect to whether any
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ shall have been satisfied
(but the accuracy of this _Section 5.12(b)_ will be so taken into account)
and no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall be breached or deemed breached.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law and except as
required to comply with any COVID-19 Measures, upon reasonable

investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation made by the Company in _Article III_ ; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to unreasonably interrupt or
interfere with the business or operations of the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that for so long as any applicable COVID-19 Measures are in
effect, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
access under this _Section 5.13_ through virtual or other remote means. All

engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning an Alternative
Transaction so long as such exclusivity agreement remains in effect. The
Company shall promptly (but in any event within forty-eight hours) notify
Parent if the Company or any of its Representatives receive any offer for, or

inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, written or oral relating to, any
Business Combination (each such transaction, a " _Business Combination
Transaction_ "). Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Person (other than the Company and its Affiliates) and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, any of its Affiliates and any of its
or their respective Representatives may respond to any unsolicited proposal

Combination Transaction so long as such exclusivity agreement remains in
effect. Parent shall promptly (but in any event within forty-eight hours)

Transaction which notice shall include a written summary of the material terms
and conditions of any such offer, whether conveyed verbally or in writing.
Parent represents and warrants to the Company that this _Section 5.15(b)_ does
not and will not conflict with or violate any agreement, understanding or
arrangement, whether written or oral, to which the Parent or any of its
Affiliates are currently bound. Solely for purposes of this _Section 5.15(b)_

securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity.

adverse to the Company. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms and
conditions described therein, including maintaining in effect the
Subscription Agreements and using its commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions and
covenants applicable to Parent in the Subscription Agreements and otherwise

in any event within three Business Days) written notice: (i) of any amendment
to any Subscription Agreement (together with a copy of such amendment); (ii)
of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to any Subscription Agreement known to Parent; (iii) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any party
to any Subscription Agreement with respect to any actual, potential or
claimed expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach, default, termination or

Section 5.20 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the Parent
Board and the Company Board, respectively, shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.21 _Further Assurances_. The Parties shall execute and deliver, or
shall cause to be executed and delivered, such documents and
other instruments and shall take, or shall cause to be taken, such further

Agreement and give effect to the Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.22 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Parties hereto intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. None of the Parties
or their respective Affiliates shall knowingly take or knowingly cause to be
taken, or knowingly fail to take or knowingly cause to be failed to be taken,
any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent qualification for such
Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties hereto shall (i) file and retain such
information as shall be required under Section 1.368-3 of the United States

Intended Tax Treatment unless otherwise required by a "determination" within

use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify all other Parties of any
challenge to the Intended Tax Treatment by any taxing authority.

of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Parties shall reasonably
cooperate to establish any available exemption from (or reduction in) any
Transfer Tax. Parent shall provide the Company with evidence reasonably

filing of an appropriate certificate or other evidence of exemption.

  



  

(c) The Stockholders, the Company, and its Subsidiaries shall terminate or
cause to be terminated any and all of the Tax Sharing Agreements in effect,
written or unwritten, on the Closing Date as between the Stockholders or any

authority or other Governmental Entity, regardless of the period in which
such Taxes are imposed, and there shall be no continuing obligation to
make any payments under any such Tax Sharing Agreements.

Section 5.24 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance Policy_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall cause the Company, as of the Closing, to obtain and fully
pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case with a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing from
one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's insurance carrier as of the Closing with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively,
" _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing (including in connection with the Transactions). As
of the Closing, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Closing the DandO Insurance in place as of the Closing with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the Closing, or if the
Company obtains the "tail" insurance policies, the Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Company to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six
(6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies
as of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be
required to pay a premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for such purpose; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, Parent shall cause the Company to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(b) During the six (6)-year period from and after the Closing, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing and rights to advancement of expenses relating
thereto now existing in favor of any indemnitee as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any indemnification agreement
between such indemnitee and the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ "), in each
case, as in effect on the Execution Date and made available to Parent prior
to the date hereof, shall not be amended, restated, amended and restated,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnitee.

  



  

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective legal
successors or permitted assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the legal successors and permitted assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.24_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.24_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and from and after the
Closing shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, who is an intended third-
party beneficiary of this _Section 5.24_. The rights of the Indemnitees
under this _Section 5.24_ shall be in addition to any rights such
Indemnitees may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company and
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws and nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed or shall release or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company for any of their respective directors, officers
or other employees (it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.24_ is not prior to or in substitution of
any such claims under such policies).

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(d) At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase, through a representative at Aon plc designated by Parent, a

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall have the right to update the following sections of the Company
Disclosure Letter: (i) _Section 1.2_ ( _Funded Indebtedness_ ); and (ii)

Contracts_ ) _,_ _Section 3.13(a)_ and _Section 3.13(b)_ ( _Real Property_ )
and _Section 3.16(a)_ ( _Intellectual Property_ ); provided, however, that for
purposes of subsection (ii), the ability to update those sections of the
Company Disclosure Letter is limited only to actions underlying such
disclosures taken by the Company to the extent occurring and arising after
the date hereof that do not constitute a breach of the Company's covenants
contained in _Section 5.1_.

  



  

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall also have the
right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Letter with respect to any matter hereafter arising and first existing or
occurring after the Execution Date and not existing or arising prior to the
Execution Date that would cause the failure of any closing condition set forth
in _Section 6.2(a)_  to be satisfied (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ ") but
only to the extent such matter has not arisen as a result of the Company's
breach of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement. Any disclosure in
any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of termination rights contained in this Agreement or
of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ have
been satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent has the right to, but

have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to
such matter.

commercially reasonable efforts to seek approval by its stockholders, in
accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the right of any
"disqualified individual" to receive or retain any payments that would, in

parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Prior to
seeking such approvals, the Company shall seek, and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, waivers from the intended recipients of such
payments such that unless such payments are approved by the stockholders to

entitlement with respect thereto. At least three (3) days prior to obtaining

5.27_  and (b) a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
its determination of the payments and benefits that it is proposing to have
waived and disclosed to comply with this _Section 5.27_. The Company shall
incorporate any reasonable comments made by Parent prior to obtaining the
waivers and soliciting the stockholder vote. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the Company's
stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 5.27_ and that either (i) the requisite number of votes was
obtained (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not
obtained and, to the extent waived by the recipient thereof, no such excess
parachute payment shall be made.

the Stockholder (collectively, the " _Subject Shares_ ") that are entitled to
vote (or express consent or dissent in writing, as applicable), in each case
as follows:

  



  

(i) in favor of any proposal for stockholders of the Company to adopt the
Merger Agreement and approve any other matters necessary for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger;

  



  

(ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn a Meeting at which there is a
proposal for stockholders of the Company to adopt the Merger Agreement to a
later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement or
if there are not sufficient Shares present in person or represented by proxy
at such Meeting to constitute a quorum;

  



  

(iii) against any proposal providing for an Alternative Transaction or the
adoption of an agreement to enter into an Alternative Transaction;

  



  

   

C-2

 



    



  

(iv) against any proposal for any amendment or modification of the Company's
Organizational Documents that would change the voting rights of any Shares or
the number of votes required to approval any proposal, including the vote
required to adopt the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

(v) against any action, transaction or agreement that (A) would result in a
breach of any representation or warranty or covenant of the Company under the
Merger Agreement; (B) would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair

any of the conditions set forth in Article VI of the Merger Agreement not
being fulfilled.

  



  

(b) Any vote required to be cast or consent or dissent in writing required
to be expressed pursuant to this _Section 1.01_ shall be cast or expressed in
accordance with the applicable procedures relating thereto so as to ensure
that it is duly counted for purposes of determining that a quorum is present
(if applicable) and for purposes of recording the results of that vote or
Consent Solicitation. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein
requires the Stockholder (or entitles any proxy of the Stockholder) to
convert, exercise or exchange any options, warrants or convertible securities
in order to obtain any underlying Shares.

  



  

(c) The Stockholder agrees not to enter into any commitment, agreement,
understanding or similar arrangement with any Person to vote or give voting

Shares (or any right, title or interest therein) or any rights to acquire any
securities or equity interests of the Company; (b) deposit any Subject Shares
or any rights to acquire any securities or equity interests of the Company
into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or any other arrangement
with respect to any Subject Shares or any rights to acquire any securities or
equity interests of the Company or grant or purport to grant any proxy or
power of attorney with respect thereto; (c) enter into any contract, option,
call or other arrangement or undertaking, whether or not in writing, with
respect to the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer (including by
succession or otherwise by operation of Law), exchange, pledge, hypothecation
or other encumbrance or disposition, or limitation on the voting rights, of
any Subject Shares (or any right, title or interest therein) or any rights to
acquire any securities or equity interests of the Company; (d) otherwise
grant, permit or suffer the creation of any Liens on any Subject Shares
(other than applicable restrictions on transfer under U.S. state or federal
securities or "blue sky" Laws) or (e) commit or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions (any action described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and
(e), a " _Transfer_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
prohibit Transfers (i) between the Stockholder and any Affiliate of the
Stockholder, (ii) to a trust for the benefit of the Stockholder or to any
member of a Stockholder's immediate family or a trust for the benefit of such
immediate family member or (iii) by will, other testamentary document or
under the laws of intestacy upon the death of Stockholder, in each case, so
long as, prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of any such
Transfer, such Affiliate or transferee executes and delivers to Parent a
joinder to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Annex C_. Any
Transfer or action in violation of this _Section 1.02_ shall be void _ab
initio_. If any involuntary Transfer of any of Subject Shares occurs, the
transferee (and all transferees and subsequent transferees of such
transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of the
restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect during the Applicable Period. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 1.02_ shall prevent entry into
or performance of any obligations pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Registration Rights Agreement.

  



  

   

C-3

 



    



  

Section 1.03. _Stop Transfer_. The Stockholder shall not request that the

uncertificated interest representing any Subject Shares made in violation of

Section 1.04. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. The Stockholder hereby agrees not
to assert, exercise or perfect, directly or indirectly, and irrevocably and

to the Merger (collectively, " _Appraisal Rights_ ").

  



  

Section 1.05. _Public Announcements; Filings; Disclosures_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder (and the Stockholder's controlled Affiliates) shall not
issue any press release or make any other public announcement or public
statement (a " _Public Communication_ ") with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
may be withheld in Parent's sole discretion), except (i) as required by
applicable Law or court process, in which case the Stockholder shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and Parent's legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Public Communication in
advance of its issuance and shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any such comments or (ii) with respect to a Public
Communication that is consistent with prior disclosures by Parent; _provided_
, that the foregoing shall not apply to any disclosure required to be made by
the Stockholder to a Governmental Entity so long as such disclosure is
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the
disclosures made by the Company and Parent pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 1.05(a)_ , if the Stockholder is a director or officer of the
Company, in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company, he
or she may make public statements in such capacity to the extent permitted
under the Merger Agreement.

to publish and disclose in any Public Communication or in any disclosure
required by the SEC and in the proxy statement prepared by Parent and filed
with the SEC relating to the Parent Special Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_
") the Stockholder's identity and ownership of Subject Shares and the
Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement (the " _Stockholder
Information_ "), consents to the filing of this Agreement to the extent
required by applicable Law to be filed with the SEC or any regulatory
authority relating to the Merger, and agrees to cooperate with Parent in
connection with such filings, including providing Stockholder
Information reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide the Stockholder with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any Stockholder Information included in such disclosure
in advance of its filing. As promptly as practicable, the Stockholder shall
notify Parent of any required corrections with respect to any Stockholder
Information supplied by the Stockholder, if and to the extent the Stockholder
becomes aware that any such Stockholder Information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect.

5.15(a) ( _Exclusivity_ ) of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the
Stockholder, solely in the Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of the
Company, agrees not to, directly or indirectly, take any action that would
violate Section 5.15(a) of the Merger Agreement if such Stockholder were
deemed a "Representative" of the Company for purposes of Section 5.15(a) of
the Merger Agreement; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not serve
to limit or restrict any actions taken by such Stockholder in any capacity
other than as a stockholder of the Company, to the extent such actions are in
compliance with or required under Section 5.15(a) of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 1.06(a)_ , the Stockholder may participate in
discussions and negotiations with any Person making a proposal relating to an
Alternative Transaction (or its Representatives) with respect to such proposal
if (i) the Company is engaging in discussions or negotiations with such
Person in compliance with Section 5.15(a) of the Merger Agreement and (ii)
such Stockholder's negotiations and discussions are in conjunction with and
ancillary to the Company's discussions and negotiations.

  



  

Section 1.07. _No Agreement as Director or Officer_. The Stockholder is
entering into this Agreement solely in the Stockholder's capacity as record
or beneficial owner of Subject Shares and nothing herein is intended to or
shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder or any employee,
officer, director (or person performing similar functions), partner or other
Affiliate (including, for this purpose, any appointee or representative of
the Stockholder to the board of directors of the Company) of the
Stockholder, solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company) or other fiduciary capacity for the
Company's stockholders.

  



  

Section 1.08. _Acquisition of Additional Shares_. The Stockholder shall
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) notify Parent of the
number of any additional Shares with respect to which the Stockholder becomes
the holder of record or acquires beneficial ownership, if any, after the
execution of this Agreement and before the Expiration Date, which Shares
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, automatically become Subject Shares in
accordance with _Section 1.01_.

action, in law or in equity, in any court or before any Governmental Entity
(a) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin or delay the operation
of, any provision of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (including any
claim seeking to enjoin or delay the consummation of the Merger), (b) alleging
a breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with the Merger
Agreement or the Transactions, or (c) seeking Appraisal Rights in connection

entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof.

the surviving corporation;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger and subject to the terms and conditions of

(30) days after the Closing, prepare and file with the Commission a
registration statement on Form S-1, or Form S-3 if such registration statement
form is available to the Company, and take all such other actions as are
necessary to ensure that there is an effective "shelf" registration statement
containing a prospectus that remains current covering (and to qualify under
required U.S. state securities laws, if any) the offer and sale of all
Registrable Securities by the Holders on a continuous or delayed basis
pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act (the registration statement, the "
_Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Commission to declare the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement effective as soon as possible thereafter, but in any event
within three (3) days after the Commission advises the Company that it has
completed its review of such registration statement, and to remain effective
and the prospectus contained therein current until all Holders cease to hold
Registrable Securities. The Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall provide
for any method or combination of methods of resale of Registrable Securities
legally available to, and requested by, the Holders, and shall comply with
the relevant provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) _Request for Underwritten Takedowns_. The Holders that qualify as
Initiating Holders will be entitled to Underwritten Takedowns with respect to
their Registrable Securities in accordance with this _Section 2.1_. If the
Company shall receive from any Initiating Holder a written request signed by
such Initiating Holder that the Company effect any Underwritten Takedown with
respect to all or a part of the Registrable Securities (such request shall
state the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be disposed
of by such Initiating Holder), the Company will:

  



  

(i) promptly, and in any event, within five (5) days after receiving such
request, give written notice of the proposed Underwritten Takedown to
all other Qualified Holders; and

  



  

(ii) as soon as practicable, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Commission to declare such Underwritten Takedown effective within ninety (90)
days thereafter (including, without limitation, filing post-effective
amendments, one or more prospectus supplements, appropriate
qualifications under any applicable blue sky or other state securities laws,
and appropriate compliance with the Securities Act) and to permit and
facilitate the sale and distribution in an underwritten offering of all or
such portion of such Registrable Securities as are specified in such request,
together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities of any Holder
or Holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request
received by the Company within ten (10) days after such written notice
from the Company is mailed or delivered.

  



  

(c) _Limitations on Underwritten Takedowns_. The Company shall not be
obligated to effect any Underwritten Takedown pursuant to this _Section 2.1_
:

  



  

(i) If the Initiating Holder, together with the holders of any other
securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such Underwritten Takedown,
propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any),
the aggregate proceeds of which are anticipated to be less than $20,000,000;

  



    

D-7

 



    



  

(ii) In any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to
execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such
registration, qualification, or compliance, unless the Company is already
subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the
Securities Act;

  



  

(iii) If the Company has effected two (2) such Underwritten Takedowns in any
given twelve (12) month period;

  



  

(iv) If the Initiating Holder proposes to dispose of shares of Registrable
Securities that may be registered on Form S-3 pursuant to the request
made pursuant to _Section 2.2_;

  



  

(v) If the Initiating Holder does not request that such offering be firmly
underwritten by underwriters selected by the Initiating Holder (subject
to the consent of the Company); or

  



  

(vi) If the Company and the Initiating Holder are unable to obtain the
commitment of the underwriter described in clause (v) above to firmly
underwrite the offer.

  



  

(d) _Other Shares_. Any Underwritten Takedown may, subject to the provisions
of _Section 2.1(f)_ , include Other Shares, and may include securities of the
Company being sold for the account of the Company, _provided that_ , any Other
Shares or securities of the Company to be included in an Underwritten
Takedown must be the subject of an effective shelf registration statement at
the time the Company receives the request for an Underwritten Takedown from
the Initiating Holder.

  



  

(e) _Underwriting; Cutback_. If the Company requests inclusion in any
Underwritten Takedown of securities to be sold for its own account, or if
other persons request inclusion of Other Shares in any Underwritten Takedown,
the Initiating Holder shall, on behalf of all Holders, offer to include such
securities in the underwriting and such offer shall be conditioned upon the
participation of the Company or such other persons in such underwriting and
the inclusion of the Company's and such other person's securities of the
Company and their acceptance of the applicable provisions of this _Section 2_.
The Company shall (together with all Holders and other persons proposing to
distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the representative of the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company,
which underwriters are reasonably acceptable to a majority-in-interest of
Holders that qualify as Initiating Holders. No Holder (or its permitted
transferee or assignee under _Section 2.11_ or _Section 2.13_ ) shall be
required to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements with,
the Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Holder's (or such transferee's or assignee's)
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by law.

  



    

D-8

 



    



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 2.1_ , if the
underwriters, in good faith, advise the Initiating Holder in writing that
marketing factors require a limitation on the number of securities of the
Company to be underwritten, the number of Registrable Securities and Other
Shares that may be so included shall be allocated as follows: (i) first, among
Initiating Holders requesting to include Registrable Securities in such
Underwritten Takedown based on the _pro rata_ percentage of Registrable
Securities held by such Initiating Holders (determined based on the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities held by each such Initiating
Holder), provided that not less than 20% of the allocation in this clause (i)
shall be for the Sponsor or its permitted transferees under  _Section 2.11_
or _Section 2.13_ ; (ii) second, among all other Holders requesting to include
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Takedown based on the _pro rata_
percentage of Registrable Securities held by such Holders (determined
based on the aggregate number of Registrable Securities held by each such
Holder); (iii) third, to the Company, which the Company may allocate, at its
discretion, for its own account, or for the account of other Holders or
employees of the Company, and (iv) fourth, to any Other Selling Stockholders
requesting to include Other Shares in such Underwritten Takedown.

  



  

If a person who has requested inclusion in such Underwritten Takedown as
provided above does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting,
such person shall be excluded therefrom by written notice to the Company, the
underwriter or the Initiating Holders, and the securities so excluded shall
also be withdrawn from the Underwritten Takedown. If securities are so
withdrawn from the Underwritten Takedown and if the number of shares to be
included in such Underwritten Takedown was previously reduced as a result of
marketing factors pursuant to this _Section 2.1(e)_ , then the Company shall
offer to all Holders who have retained rights to include securities in the
Underwritten Takedown the right to include additional Registrable Securities
in the offering in an aggregate amount equal to the number of shares so
withdrawn, with such shares to be allocated among such Holders requesting
additional inclusion, as set forth above.

  



  

(f) _Deferral; Suspension_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Company furnishes to the Holders a certificate (the "
_Suspension Notice_ ") signed by an executive officer of the Company stating
that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors,
effecting a registration (whether by the filing of a registration statement or
by taking any other action) or the offering or disposition of Registrable
Securities thereunder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, through an
Underwritten Takedown) should be postponed or suspended because such
registration, offering or disposal would (1) materially impede, delay
or interfere with a pending material acquisition, corporate reorganization,
or other similar transaction involving the Company; (2) require premature
disclosure of material non-public information that the Company has a material
bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (3) render the
Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act, then by delivery of the Suspension Notice to the Holders, then
(in addition to the limitations set forth in _Section 2.1(c)_  of this
Agreement) the Company may so postpone effecting a registration or require the
Holders to refrain from offering or disposing of Registrable Securities for a
period of not more than sixty (60) days, and, provided further, that the
Company shall not suspend usage of a registration statement in this manner
more than once in any twelve (12) month period.

2.2 Company Registration

  



     

(a) _Company Registration/Underwritten Offering_. If the Company determines
to (1) register any of its securities either for its own account or the
account of Other Selling Stockholders (or a combination of the foregoing)
during a period in which a Resale Shelf Registration Statement covering a
Holder's Registrable Securities is not then effective, other than: a
registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ; a registration relating to the
shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants; a registration relating
solely to employee benefit plans; a registration relating to the offer and
sale of non-convertible debt securities; a registration relating to a
corporate reorganization or other Rule 145 transaction; or a registration on
any registration form that does not permit secondary sales, or (2) effect an
underwritten public offering of securities, either for its own account or the
account of Other Selling Stockholders (or a combination of the foregoing),
the Company will:

  



  

(i) promptly give written notice (in any event not later than ten (10) days
prior to the filing of the registration statement or preliminary prospectus
to which such offering relates) of the proposed registration or offering, as
applicable, to all Holders; and

  



  

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to include in such registration or
offering, as applicable, and any related qualification under blue sky laws or
other compliance, except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_, and in any
underwriting involved therein, all of such Registrable Securities as are
specified in a written request or requests made by any Holder or Holders
received by the Company within five (5) days after receipt of such written
notice from the Company. Such written request may specify all or a part of a
Holder's Registrable Securities; _provided however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, only Qualified Holders shall be entitled to
notice of and to participate in underwritten public offerings contemplated by
clause (ii) of this _Section 2.2(a)_.

  



  

(b) _Underwriting; Cutback_. If the registration or offering of which the
Company gives notice is for an underwritten public offering, the Company
shall so advise the Qualified Holders who have elected to participate (and
include the names of the proposed underwriters) as a part of the written
notice given pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(2)(i)_. All Qualified Holders
proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall
(together with the Company and the Other Selling Stockholders with
registration rights to participate therein) enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the representative of the underwriter or
underwriters selected by the Company. No Qualified Holder (or its permitted
transferee or assignee under _Section 2.11_ or  _Section 2.13_ ) shall be
required to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements with, the
Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Qualified Holder's (or such transferee's or
assignee's) authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell,
and its ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its
intended method of distribution and any other representation required by law.

  



    

D-10

 



    



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 2.2_, if the
underwriters in good faith advise the Company and the Qualified Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the offering in writing that marketing
factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the
underwriters may (subject to the limitations set forth below) limit the number
of Registrable Securities to be included in the registration and
underwriting. The Company shall so advise all holders of securities requesting
registration, and the number of shares of securities that are entitled to be
included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated (1) if the
underwritten offering is for the Company's account, (m) first, to the Company;
(n) second, to the Qualified Holders requesting to include Registrable
Securities in such offering based on the _pro rata_ percentage of Registrable
Securities held by such Qualified Holders (determined based on the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities held by each such Qualified Holder); and (o)
third, to the Other Selling Stockholders, if any, requesting to include Other
Shares in such underwritten offering pursuant to piggyback rights and (2) if
the underwritten offering is for the account of Other Selling Stockholders,
then (x) first, to the Other Selling Stockholders, (y) second, to the
Qualified Holders requesting to include Registrable Securities in such
offering based on the _pro rata_ percentage of Registrable Securities held by
such Qualified Holders (determined based on the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities held by each such Qualified Holder); and (z) third, to
the Company.

  



  

If a person who has requested inclusion in such registration as provided
above does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting, such person
shall be excluded therefrom by written notice to the Company and the
underwriter. Any Registrable Securities or Other Shares excluded or withdrawn
from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall be responsible
for the Registration Expenses prior to any such withdrawal.

  



  

(c) _Right to Terminate Registration_. The Company shall have the right to
terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this _Section
2.2_ prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any
Holder has elected to include securities in such registration.

  



  

(d) _Limitations_. The Company shall not be obligated to effect any
registrations pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ :

  



  

(i) After the Company has initiated five (5) such Underwritten Takedowns
pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ (counting for these purposes only (x)
registrations in which Registrable Securities are not excluded or reduced
pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ and which have been declared or ordered
effective and pursuant to which securities have been sold, and (y) withdrawn
registrations);

  



  

(ii) If the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable
Securities that may be registered on Form S-3 pursuant to the request
made pursuant to _Section 2.1_;

  



  

(iii) If the Initiating Holders do not request that such offering be firmly
underwritten by underwriters selected by such Initiating Holders (subject
to the consent of the Company); or

  



  

(iv) If the Company and the Initiating Holders are unable to obtain the
commitment of the underwriter described in clause (iii) above to firmly
underwrite the offer.

  



    

D-11

 



    



  

2.3 Expenses of Registration. All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with registrations pursuant to this _Section 2_ shall be borne by
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to
_Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ if the registration request is subsequently
withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities to be registered or because a sufficient number of Holders shall
have withdrawn so that the minimum offering conditions set forth in _Sections
2.1_ and _2.2_ are no longer satisfied (in which case all participating
Holders shall bear such expenses _pro rata_ among each other based on the
number of Registrable Securities requested to be so registered), unless the
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to forfeit
their right to a demand registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if a withdrawal by the Holders is based upon material adverse
information relating to the Company that is different from the information
known or available (upon request from the Company or otherwise) to the
Holders requesting registration at the time of their request for registration
under  _Section 2.1_, such registration shall not be treated as a counted
registration for purposes of _Section 2.1_, even though the Holders do not
bear the Registration Expenses for such registration. All Selling Expenses
relating to securities registered on behalf of the Holders and the holders of
any Other Shares shall be borne by the Holders and any holders of any
Other Shares included in such registration _pro rata_ among each other on the
basis of the number of Registrable Securities and Other Shares, respectively,
registered on their behalf.

  



  

2.4 Registration Procedures. In the case of each registration of Registrable
Securities pursuant to _Section 2_, the Company will keep each Holder

all securities covered by such registration statement;

  



  

(d) Notify the participating Holders of Registrable Securities, and confirm

statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions
as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders; _provided_ , that the
Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition
thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of
process in any such states or jurisdictions where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify or when it is not then otherwise subject to service of
process;

  



  

(g) Notify each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result
of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or incomplete in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and following such notification
promptly prepare and file a post-effective amendment to such
registration statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or any
document incorporated therein by reference, and file any other
required document that would be incorporated by reference into such
registration statement and prospectus, so that such registration
statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, and that such prospectus does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and, in the case of a post-effective amendment to a registration
statement, use reasonable best efforts to cause it to be declared effective
as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and give to the Holders listed as
selling security holders in such prospectus a written notice of such amendment
or supplement, and, upon receipt of such notice, each such Holder agrees not
to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement
until such Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus or until it receives further written notice from the Company that
such sales may re-commence;

  



  

(h) Use its reasonable best efforts to prevent, or obtain the withdrawal of,
any order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement

statement of the withdrawal of any such order);

  



    

D-13

 



    



  

(i) Provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and registrar
for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to such registration
statement and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each
case not later than the effective date of such registration;

Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates

certificates, or agreements as may be necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities to be so delivered;

(m) Furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
registration statement a signed counterpart, addressed to such Holder, of (1)
any opinion of counsel to the Company delivered to any underwriter dated the
effective date of the registration statement or, in the event of an
underwritten offering, the date of the closing under the applicable
underwriting agreement, in customary form, scope, and substance, at a minimum
to the effect that the registration statement has been declared effective and
that no stop order is in effect, which counsel and opinions shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and their respective counsel and (2)
any comfort letter from the Company's independent public accountants
delivered to any underwriter in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by comfort letters as the managing underwriter or
underwriters reasonably request. If no legal opinion is delivered to any
underwriter, the Company shall furnish to each Holder of Registrable
Securities included in such registration statement, at any time that such
Holder elects to use a prospectus, an opinion of counsel to the Company
to the effect that the registration statement containing such prospectus has
been declared effective and that no stop order is in effect and any other
matters as the Holders or underwriter may reasonably request and as are
customarily included;

  



  

(n) Promptly identify to the selling Holders any underwriter(s) participating

diligence in connection therewith;

  



    

D-14

 



    



  

(o) Reasonably cooperate, and cause each of its principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, and all other
officers and members of the management to fully cooperate in any offering of
Registrable Securities hereunder, which cooperation shall include, without
limitation, assisting with the preparation of any registration statement or
amendment thereto with respect to such offering and all other offering
materials and related documents, and participation in meetings with
underwriters, attorneys, accountants and potential stockholders;

  



  

(p) Otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission and make available to its
stockholders an earnings statement (in a form that satisfies the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act
or any successor rule thereto) no later than thirty (30) days after the end of
the 12-month period beginning with the first day of the Company's first full
fiscal quarter after the effective date of such registration statement, which
earnings statement shall cover said 12-month period, and which requirement
will be deemed to be satisfied if the Company timely files complete
and accurate information on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K under the Exchange Act
and otherwise complies with Rule 158 under the Securities Act or any
successor rule thereto;

  



  

(q) Reasonably cooperate with each Holder and each underwriter or agent, if
any, participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and
their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made
with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (" _FINRA_ "), and use
its reasonable best efforts to make or cause to be made any filings required
to be made by an issuer with FINRA in connection with the filing of any
registration statement;

  



  

(r) In the event of any underwritten public offering of Registrable
Securities, cause senior executive officers of the Company to participate in
customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably requested by the
managing underwriter in any such underwritten offering and otherwise to
facilitate, cooperate with, and participate in each proposed offering
contemplated herein and customary selling efforts related thereto;

  



  

(s) Take all reasonable action to ensure that any "free writing prospectus"
(as defined in the Securities Act) utilized in connection with any
registration of Registrable Securities complies in all material respects with
the Securities Act, is filed in accordance with the Securities Act to the
extent required thereby, is retained in accordance with the Securities Act to
the extent required thereby and, when taken together with the related
prospectus, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and

  



  

(t) Take all such other reasonable actions as are necessary or advisable in

2.5 Price and Underwriting Discounts. In the case of an underwritten offering
requested by Holders pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , the price,
underwriting discount and other financial terms of the related underwriting
agreement for the Registrable Securities shall be determined by the
participating Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities. In the
case of any underwritten offering pursuant to  _Section 2.2_, such price,
discount and other terms shall be determined by the Company, subject to the
right of the Holders to withdraw their request to participate in the
registration pursuant to _Section 2.2_ after being advised of such
price, discount and other terms.

  



  

2.6 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement. The Holders shall not sell, transfer, make
any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any
hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale with
respect to, any Common Stock (or other securities of the Company) held by the
Holders (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified
by the representatives of the managing underwriter or underwriters of Common
Stock (or other securities of the Company convertible into Common Stock) not
to exceed five (5) days prior and ninety (90) days following any Underwritten
Takedown. Each of the Holders that is a director or officer of the Company or
that owns more than five percent (5%) of the Company's Common Stock also shall
execute and deliver any "lock-up" agreement reasonably requested by the
managing underwriter of such Underwritten Takedown, but only to the extent as
is required generally of any executive officers, directors or five percent
(5%) or greater stockholder by such managing underwriter.

  



  

2.7 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder, and each shareholder, member, limited or general partner
thereof, each shareholder, member, limited or general partner of each such
shareholder, member, limited or general partner, each of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advisors, and agents
and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act) such Persons and each of their respective Representatives, and
each underwriter, if any, and each person or entity who controls within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act any underwriter, against all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, claims, judgments, suits, costs, penalties,
losses, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings or settlements in
respect thereof) arising out of or based on: (i) any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained or incorporated by
reference in any prospectus, offering circular or other document (including
any related registration statement, notification or the like) incident to any
such registration, qualification or compliance, (ii) any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any
violation (or alleged violation) by the Company of the Securities Act,
Exchange Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation thereunder
applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction required of the
Company in connection with any offering covered by such registration,
qualification or compliance, and the Company will reimburse each Holder, and
each shareholder, member, limited or general partner thereof, each
shareholder, member, limited or general partner of each such shareholder,
member, limited or general partner, each of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advisors, and agents and each
Person who controls such persons and each of their respective
Representatives, and each underwriter, if any, and each person or entity who

reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and defending or
settling any such claim, judgment, suit, penalty, loss, damage, liability or
action; _provided_ that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such claim, judgment, suit, penalty loss, damage, liability,
or action arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission based
upon written information furnished to the Company by such Holder, any of such
Holder's Representatives, any person or entity controlling such Holder, such
underwriter or any person or entity who controls any such underwriter, and
stated to be specifically for use therein; _provided_ ,  _further_ that, the
indemnity agreement contained in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). This indemnity shall be
in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by such Holder.

  



    

D-16

 



    



  

(b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not
jointly, will, if Registrable Securities held by such Holder are included in
the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is
being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its
directors, officers, employees, partners, legal counsel and accountants and
each underwriter, if any, of the Company's securities covered by such a
registration statement, each person or entity who controls the Company or such
underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, each
other such Holder, and each of their officers, directors and partners, and
each person or entity controlling each other such Holder, and each of their
respective Representatives, against all claims, judgments, penalties losses,
damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or
based on: (i) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a
material fact contained or incorporated by reference in any prospectus,
offering circular or other document (including any related registration
statement, notification, or the like) incident to any such
registration, qualification or compliance made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration,
(ii) any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each
case made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing by or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection
with such registration, or (iii) any violation (or alleged violation) by the
Company of the Securities Act, any state securities laws or any rule or
regulation thereunder applicable to the Holder and relating to action or
inaction required of the Holder in connection with any offering covered by
such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse the Company
and such Holders, directors, officers, partners, legal counsel and
accountants, persons, underwriters, or control persons for any legal or any
other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to
the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission (i)
is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or
other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by such Holder and stated to be specifically for use
therein and (ii) has not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or
concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities to the person
asserting the claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of such
Holder hereunder shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) if
such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and _provided_ that in no event
shall any indemnity under this _Section 2.7_ exceed the net proceeds from
the offering received by such Holder, except in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct by such Holder.

  



    

D-17

 



    



  

(c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this _Section 2.7_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall (i) give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after such Indemnified
Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought
( _provided_ , that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only to the
extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of
such delay or failure), and (ii) permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the
defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; _provided_ that
counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such
claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and
the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such party's expense
unless (w) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or
expenses, (x) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of such
claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the
Indemnified Party hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, (y) the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded
(based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses available
to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (z) in the reasonable judgment
of any such person (based upon advice of its counsel) a conflict of interest
may exist between such person and the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
claims (in which case, if the person notifies the Indemnifying Party in
writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person). No Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Each Indemnified
Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question
as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be
reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and
litigation resulting therefrom.

  



  

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.7_ is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified
Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred
to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or
expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of
the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. No Holder will be required under this
_Section 2.7(d)_ to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds from

The obligations of the Company and Holders under this _Section 2.7_ shall
survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a
registration under this _Section 2.7_ and otherwise shall survive the
termination of this Agreement until the expiration of the applicable period
of the statute of limitations.

  



  

2.8 Information by Holder. Each Holder of Registrable Securities shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and
the distribution proposed by such Holder as the Company may reasonably
request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any
registration, qualification, or compliance referred to in this _Section 2_.

  



  

2.9 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of
certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale of
the Restricted Securities to the public without registration, the Company
agrees to:

  



  

(a) Make and keep adequate current public information with respect to the
Company available in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

  



  

(b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act; and

  



  

(c) So long as a Holder owns any Restricted Securities, furnish to the Holder
forthwith upon written request a written statement by the Company as to
its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, or that it qualifies as registrant whose
securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Company
so qualifies), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the
Company, and such other reports and documents so filed as a Holder may
reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the
Commission allowing a Holder to sell any such securities without
registration. The Company further covenants that it shall take such further
action as any Holder may reasonably request to enable such Holder to sell
from time to time shares of Common Stock held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144, including providing at the Company's expense any legal
opinions.

  



  

2.10 No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered, as of the date
hereof, nor shall the Company, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter
into any agreement with respect to its securities, that would have the effect
of impairing the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities or
otherwise conflict with the provisions hereof. Unless the Company receives the
consent of each of (i) the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities issued to the Sponsor and (ii) the Holders holding a majority of
the Merger Shares that are Registrable Securities, the Company shall not enter
into any agreement with respect to its securities, that would have the effect
of impairing the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities or
otherwise conflict with the provisions hereof.

2.11 Transfer or Assignment of Rights. This Agreement and the rights, duties
and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or delegated by
the Company in whole or in part. The rights granted to a Holder by the Company
under this _Section 2_ may be transferred or assigned (but only with all
related obligations) by a Holder only to a transferee of Registrable
Securities;  _provided,_ that (x) such transfer or assignment of Registrable
Securities is effected in accordance with applicable securities laws, (y) the
Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with
written notice of the name and address of such transferee and the Registrable
Securities with respect to which such rights are being transferred and (z)
such transferee agrees in a written instrument delivered to the Company to be
bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

day period commencing at least 150 days after the Merger and (3) the date on
which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange,
reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the
Company's stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common
Stock for cash, securities or other property. Each of Sponsor and Jefferies
agree that they shall not Transfer Private Placement Units (or any securities
underlying the Private Placement Units, including the shares of Common Stock
and Private Placement Warrants included in the Private Placement Units
and the shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the
Private Placement Warrants), until 30 days after the Closing. This Section

Agreement, dated August 18, 2020, among the Company, Forum Capital Management
III LLC and certain directors and officers of the Company.

  



  

(b) The Holders of Merger Shares agree that they shall not Transfer any of
the Merger Shares held by the Holders until the date that is the six month

that is the twelve month anniversary of the Closing and (ii) 50% of the Merger

of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Founder Shares that are
held by the Sponsor, any Holder of Merger Shares or any of their permitted

any of the Company's officers or directors, any members of the Sponsor, any

(b) in the case of a Holder that is an entity, to the equityholders of such
Holder; (c) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of such
individual's immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a
member of such individual's immediate family, an affiliate of such individual
or to a charitable organization; (d) in the case of an individual, by virtue
of laws of descent and distribution upon death of such individual; (e) in the
case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (f)
by private sales or transfers made in connection with the consummation of the
Merger at prices no greater than the price at which the securities were

in the case of clauses (a) through (f) or (h), these permitted transferees
must enter into a written agreement with the Company agreeing to be bound by
the transfer restrictions herein.

conferred on an Investor, as if such Investor remained a single party to this
Agreement.

occurs prior to the conclusion of any applicable lock-up period pursuant to
Section 2.12 applicable to the Sponsor or an Investor, distributees shall be

This Restrictive Covenant Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of

References to the "Company" in this Agreement shall refer to Parent after
giving effect to the consummation of the Merger (as defined below) and each of
Parent's direct and indirect Subsidiaries (including ELM) and any of their
respective successors-in-interest or joint ventures (if any).

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, this Agreement is being entered into in connection with that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 10, 2020 (the "Signing
Date") (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time in
accordance therewith, the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Parent, ELMS
Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), Electric Last Mile, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ELM") and
Jason Luo, in the capacity as the initial Stockholder Representative thereto.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent (i) is a publicly listed special purpose acquisition vehicle,
which has been established for the purpose of effecting an initial business
combination, and (ii) has no material operating assets (other than those of a
kind customarily held by a special purpose acquisition vehicle).

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in,
the Merger Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, and ELM will enter into a
business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with ELM
continuing as the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, (i) the stockholders of ELM that existed
a moment in time prior to the Merger, will have their equity interests in ELM
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth
in the Merger Agreement, and (ii) ELM (as the Surviving Corporation) will be
a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Agreement
is being entered into as part of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, (ii)
the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are a material
inducement to, and a condition precedent of, Parent's willingness to enter
into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger, (iii) the Restricted
Party shall receive substantial direct and indirect benefits by the
consummation of the Merger (including the Restricted Party's portion of
the consideration received by such Restricted Party in connection with the
Merger), if any, and (iv) Parent and its Affiliates would not obtain the
benefit of the bargain set forth in the Merger Agreement as specifically
negotiated by the parties thereto if the Restricted Party breached the
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition to the consummation of the Merger, the Restricted
Party has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and
covenants of the Parties set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

  



   | 1.| _Covenants of the Restricted Party_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.1.| _Restrictive Covenants_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

1.1.1. _Non-Competition_. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Restricted
Party shall not, and shall cause each of his, her or its controlled Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, own any interest in, control, manage,
operate, participate in, develop products for, advise or consult with or
render services for (as a director, officer, employee, agent, broker, partner
or contractor), or engage in activities or businesses, or establish any
new businesses, within North America (including Mexico), China or Europe (the
"Territory") any business that is competitive with the business operated by
the Company as of the Signing Date or as of immediately prior to the Closing,
including any activities or business engaged in the design, development,
homologation, manufacture, importation, marketing, promotion,
distribution, offering for sale, sale, and other commercialization of any and
all products and services currently under development or in
production (including the vehicles known as the "Urban Delivery (Light Duty
Platform)" and "Urban Utility (Medium Duty Platform)") as of the Signing Date
(collectively, the "Business"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section
1.1.1_  shall be deemed not breached solely as a result of the ownership by
the Restricted Party or any of his, her or its Affiliates of less than an
aggregate of 1% of any class of stock that is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and is listed on a national securities exchange.

  



  

1.1.2. _Non-Solicitation of Business Relations_. During the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Restricted Party shall not, and shall cause each of his, her or its
controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) adversely interfere
with the relationship between the Company and any Material Business
Relationship, (ii) solicit, induce or attempt to induce (or assist any other
Person in soliciting, inducing or attempting to induce), any Material
Business Relationship to terminate its relationship with the Company, cease
doing business with the Company or terminate or otherwise adversely modify
its relationship with the Company, or (iii) acquire or attempt to acquire an
interest in any Person or business in which, prior to the Closing, ELM had
either (a) requested or received information relating to the acquisition of
such Person or business, (b) identified to Parent that such Person or
business was a potential acquisition target of ELM, or (c) otherwise
contemplated the acquisition of such Person or business. "Material Business
Relationship" means any (x) material customer, supplier, licensee, licensor,
franchisee of the Company as of the Closing or at any time in the six (6)
month period prior to the Closing, or (y) any other Person with whom the
Company, as of the Closing or at any time in the six (6) month period prior to
the Closing, had a material business relationship.

  



  

1.1.3. _Non-Solicitation of Personnel; No Hire_. During the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Restricted Party shall not, and shall cause each of his, her or its
controlled Affiliates not to, and shall not assist any other Person to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, recruit or hire any employee, independent
contractor or consultant of the Company ("Company Employee"), or any Person
who was an employee, independent contractor or consultant of the Company at
any time during the 12-month period before the Closing, and (ii) solicit or
encourage any Company Employee to leave the employment of Parent; _provided_
, _however_ , that, without limiting the restrictions against hiring, the
provisions of this _Section 1.1.3_ shall not prevent the Restricted Party or
any of his, her or its Affiliates (not including the Company) from (a) making
a general solicitation for employment that are not specifically targeted at
the Company Employees or other employees of Parent or (b) soliciting,
inducing or otherwise offering employment to any Company Employees or other

or communications, either orally or in writing, regarding the Business, the
Company and its Affiliates, or any director, manager, officer, agent,
representative or direct or indirect equity holder of the Company or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 1.1.4_

an officer, director or employee of Parent, its successors-in-interest or
their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) making any truthful statement (A)
necessary with respect to any Action involving this Agreement, including, but

---|---|--- 
  



  

1.2.1 The Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the covenants and
agreements contained in _Section 1.1_ (collectively the "Non-Competition and
Related Covenants") relate to matters that are of a special, unique and
extraordinary value; (ii) the Company has one or more legitimate business
interest justifying enforcement in full of the Non-Competition and
Related Covenants, including for the protection of the goodwill of the
business acquired by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and the Non-
Competition and Related Covenants are reasonable and narrowly tailored to
protect the compelling interests of Parent, the Company and the Business;
(iii) a breach by the Restricted Party of any of the Non-Competition and
Related Covenants will result in irreparable harm and damages that may not be
adequately compensated by a monetary award and, accordingly, the Company will
be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or
redress any such breach (without posting a bond or other security); (iv)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Restricted Party will receive valuable
consideration (including, as applicable, significant benefits, equity in
Parent, and other valuable consideration), both directly or indirectly, from
Parent in connection with the Merger; and (v) the Non-Competition and Related
Covenants are intended to comply with the Laws of all jurisdictions that
might be deemed to be applicable hereto and which restrict or otherwise limit
the enforceability of a Contract that restrains a Person from engaging in a
lawful profession, trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
restrictions contained in _Section 1.1_ shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of their extending for
too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area of by reason
of their being too extensive in any other respect, _Section 1.1_ shall be
modified to be effective for the maximum period of time for which it may be
enforceable and over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be
enforceable and to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may
be enforceable. Parent and the Restricted Party hereby consent and agree to
any such reformation of the restrictions to the maximum of enforceability as
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction.

provision of this Agreement or any other such instrument. Subject to and
without limiting the application of _Section 1.2_ , upon such determination

(l) Repeatedly reporting to work under the influence of alcohol or drugs in a
manner that impacts the Employee's ability to perform the duties of the

The Company Board and Parent Board shall, in its sole discretion, have the
authority to make the determination that the Employee has been terminated for
Cause. Upon the effectiveness of any termination for Cause by the Company,

through the date of such termination for Cause, (ii) any vested employee

definition of Cause existed as of the date of such termination (whether or
not known by the Company Board and Parent Board or the Company or any of its
affiliates as of the time of such termination or discovered after any such
termination), then, the Company may deem such termination of employment to
have been for Cause, and such termination shall be treated as a termination by
the Company for Cause and the Employee acknowledges that the Employee's
compensation may also be subject to any clawback provisions required by law,
rule, regulation or Company policy (as in effect upon the Commencement Date or
any time thereafter), as well as any other agreement between the Company and
the Employee that provides for clawback of any compensation or equity in the
Company (including any equity related awards).

  



  

5.2. _Termination by the Company Without Cause_. The Company shall have the

without Cause, at any time, and for any reason or no reason at all, subject to

and such termination is not a termination for Cause under Section 5.1, then
the Employee shall receive the Accrued Amounts and a cash payment from the
Company as severance (the " _Severance Payment_ ") equal to [_______]11 of
Base Compensation as in effect at the time of the termination, subject to all
applicable federal, state, local and other withholdings. The Severance
Payment shall be paid in substantially equal installments with the Company's
regular payroll over the [______]12 period (the " _Severance Pay Period_ ")
following the effective date of termination of employment and commencing on
the first administratively practicable payroll date on or next following the
date the Release Agreement becomes effective and fully irrevocable in
accordance with Section 5.2(c) (provided that the initial and final payments
may be a greater or lesser amount so as to conform with the Company's regular
payroll period); provided that any amounts that would be payable prior to
the effectiveness of the Release Agreement (as defined below) shall be
delayed until the Release Agreement is effective and fully irrevocable.

(b) The Severance Payment will be subject to offset by the amount of any
compensation earned by the Employee or to which the Employee is entitled
during the Severance Pay Period (regardless of when any such amount is paid by
a subsequent employer or by the Company): (i) from any subsequent employer
following the termination of the Employee's employment with the Company, or
(ii) from the Company under any contingent employment agreement between the
Company and the Employee. In the event the Employee obtains other employment
before the end of the Severance Pay Period, the Employee shall immediately
notify the Company of such employment in writing. The Employee expressly
agrees that failure to immediately advise Company of the Employee's new
employment shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, and the
Employee will forfeit all Severance Payment amounts paid or that otherwise
would be paid by the Company under this Section 5 from the date of the
Employee's new employment until the end of the Severance Pay Period. The
Employee shall immediately repay to the Company all amounts paid by the
Company as a Severance Payment applicable to the period commencing on the
date of the Employee's new employment through the end of the Severance Pay
Period. Notwithstanding such forfeiture, the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Employee agrees to
furnish promptly to the Company all documentation required and/or reasonably
requested by the Company to substantiate the Employee's new employment and
all compensation and rights under the Employee's new employment.

  



  

(c) Before receiving the Severance Payment set forth in Section 5.2(a), and
as a condition to receiving the same, the Employee shall sign, and not
revoke, a release of any and all claims or potential claims against the
Company which the Employee has or may have, whether known or unknown, as of
the date of execution of the release by the Employee (the " _Release
Agreement_ "). The Company must provide the form of Release Agreement to the
Employee within fifteen (15) days after the Employee's separation from
service and the Employee must sign the Release Agreement and provide it to the
Company within twenty-one (21) days (or forty-five (45) days, if applicable
under applicable law) after receiving it from the Company and not revoke such
release during any applicable revocation period. The Release Agreement shall
be in the form as determined by the Company, in its sole discretion. To the
extent the Severance Payment is subject to Section 409A and the period for
executing (and not revoking) the Release Agreement begins in one taxable year
and ends in another taxable year, the Severance Payment shall not begin until
the beginning of the second taxable year; provided that, the first
installment payment shall include all amounts that would otherwise have been
paid to the Employee during the period beginning on the date of the
Employee's termination and ending on the first payment date if no delay
had been imposed.

5.3. _Termination by the Employee for Good Reason_. The Employee may
terminate this Agreement and/or the Employee's employment with the Company
for Good Reason, as defined below. If the Employee terminates this Agreement
for Good Reason, then the Employee shall receive the Accrued Amounts and the
Severance Payment as set forth in Section 5.2(a), subject to the requirements
of Sections 5.2(b) and (c). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Good Reason_ "
shall mean:

  



  

(a) a material diminution in the Employee's authority, duties or
responsibilities;

  



  

(b) a material diminution in the Employee's Base Compensation except for
across-the-board salary reductions similarly affecting other similarly-
situated executives of the Company or due to unforeseeable business
circumstances, pandemics, natural disasters or similar circumstances;

  



  

(c) a change that would require the Employee to relocate to a primary office
that is more than fifty (50) miles from the location of the Company's then
principal offices unless such relocation is closer to the Employee's personal
residence; or

  



  

(d) a material breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such event described above shall constitute
Good Reason unless: (1) the Employee gives written notice to the Company
specifying the condition or event relied upon for such termination within
thirty (30) days of the initial existence of such event; and (2) the Company
fails to cure the condition or event constituting Good Reason within thirty
(30) days following receipt of the Employee's written notice. If the Employee
does not terminate his or her employment for Good Reason within sixty
(60) days after the end of such thirty (30)-day cure period, then the
Employee will be deemed to have waived his or her right to terminate for Good
Reason with respect to such grounds. If the Company cures the Good Reason
condition during such cure period, Good Reason will be deemed not to have
occurred.

  



  

5.4. _Termination by Employee Without Good Reason_. The Employee may resign
from employment without Good Reason by providing sixty (60) days' advance,
written notice of the Employee's intent to resign from employment. Upon the
effectiveness of such resignation, the Company shall have no further
obligation under this Agreement and payment of all compensation to the
Employee under this Agreement shall cease immediately, except for the Accrued
Amounts. With respect to any notice period pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company may in its sole discretion (a) place the
Employee on a paid, non-working, garden leave during some or all of such
notice period (and, for the avoidance of doubt, relieve the Employee of the
Employee's title and duties during such period), and/or (b) waive such
notice, in whole or in part, by accelerating the Employee's termination date
and paying the Employee the Employee's base salary in lieu of the portion of
the notice period waived by the Company and without affecting the voluntary
nature of the Employee's termination.

5.5. _Termination Due to Disability or Death._ The Company shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement and the Employee's employment, at any time,
upon the occurrence of the Employee's death or Disability. If the Employee's
employment is terminated during the Term on account of the Employee's death
or Disability, the Company shall have no further obligation under
this Agreement and payment of all compensation to the Employee under this
Agreement shall cease immediately, except for the Accrued Amounts through the
date of such termination due to death or Disability. The term " _Disability_ "
as used in this Agreement shall mean that the Employee is entitled to receive
long-term disability benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan
or, if there is no such plan, the Employee has incurred (1) a permanent and
total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code or any successor provision, or (2) a physical or mental
disability that renders the Employee unable to perform the required functions
of the Employee's position, duties, and responsibilities under
this Agreement, and which, in either case, has existed for at least ninety
(90) consecutive days or one hundred and twenty (120) non-consecutive days
during any three hundred sixty-five (365) day period as determined by the
Company Board and Parent Board.

  



  

5.6. _COBRA Coverage_. Solely in the event of a termination by the Company
without Cause pursuant to Section 5.2 and subject to the execution of the
Release Agreement by the Employee and the Release Agreement becoming effective
and fully irrevocable pursuant to Section 5.2(c), if the Employee timely and
properly elects health continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ "), the Company shall reimburse
the Employee for the difference between the monthly COBRA premium actually
paid by the Employee for the Employee and the Employee's dependents and the
monthly premium amount paid by similarly-situated active executives of the
Company during the same period. Such reimbursement shall be paid to the
Employee in the month immediately following the month in which the Employee
timely remits the premium payment and the Employee provides proof of payment
of such premium. The Employee shall be eligible to receive such reimbursement
until the earliest of: (i) the end of the Severance Period; (ii) the date the
Employee is no longer eligible to receive COBRA continuation coverage; and
(iii) the date on which the Employee becomes eligible to receive
substantially similar coverage from another employer or other source.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect
to provide a cash payment to the Employee in lieu of providing
reimbursement as described herein in an amount reasonably determined by the
Company to be equivalent to the amount of COBRA premium reimbursements that
would otherwise be due by the Company under this Section 5.6 for the Severance
Period, without regard to any effect of taxation of such cash payment to the
Employee. If the Employee obtains other employment prior to the end of the
Severance Period which offers any of such insurance coverage, the Company's
obligation to reimburse the Employee for COBRA payments will be
immediately terminated. The Employee agrees to furnish promptly to the
Company all documentation required and/or reasonably requested by the Company
regarding subsequent benefit eligibility.

  



  

5.7. _Incentive Compensation_. In the event of any termination of
employment, any equity-based or cash incentive awards shall be treated
as provided in the applicable plan document.

  



  

6.  Confidentiality, Inventions, and Non-Solicitation Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Employee shall enter into with the Company a Confidentiality, Inventions, and Non-Solicitation Agreement in substantially the form set forth under _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _CIIAA_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall have no force or effect and be null and void ab initio if the Employee fails to execute the CIIAA prior to the Effective Time.

7.2. _Non-Competition_. During the Restricted Period, the Employee shall not
(and shall cause the Employee's controlled affiliates not to) directly or
indirectly (including through the Employee's respective controlled affiliates
or otherwise, including as a director, officer, equityholder, partner,
consultant, employer, employee, proprietor, principal, agent, manager,

the foregoing, if the Employee holds a passive investment representing no more
than two percent (2%) of the issued and outstanding shares in a company
listed on a recognized exchange that operates, in whole or in part, directly
or indirectly as a Competing Business, this shall not constitute a breach of
this Section 7.2.

  



  

7.3.   _Non-Solicitation of Customers/Clients_. The Employee shall not (and
shall cause the Employee's controlled affiliates not to), during the
Restricted Period, directly or indirectly solicit, divert, or interfere with
the Company's relationship with, any of the Company's Customers or
Prospective Customers that the Employee had direct contact with, provided
services to, or had confidential information about, in order to offer them
goods and/or services competitive with those provided by the Company, or
influence any Person to end or to curtail any business they are currently, or
have been, transacting with the Company or otherwise negatively reduce
his/her/its business relationship with the Company.

  



  

7.4. _Non-Solicitation of Company Employees_. The Employee recognizes that
the Employee possesses confidential information about other employees of the
Company relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities,
compensation and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with Customers and
Prospective Customers of the Company. The Employee recognizes that the
information the Employee possesses about these other employees is not
generally known, is of substantial value to the Company in developing its
business and in securing and retaining Customers, and will be acquired by the
Employee because of the Employee's business position with the Company. The
Employee agrees that, during the Restricted Period, the Employee will not (and
will cause the Employee's controlled affiliates not to) (i) recruit or employ
or otherwise solicit, entice, or induce any Person that is or has been an

employee, consultant or officer for such purpose or authorize or
participate in the taking of such actions by any other Person, or assist or

7.5. _Non-Disparagement_. The Employee shall not (and shall cause the

of its affiliates, including the Company's or its applicable affiliate's (i)
predecessors, members, present or former directors, managers, employees,
consultants, officers, partners, attorneys or other representatives,
individually and in their official capacities, or (ii) products, services,
practices or operations. However, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Employee from testifying truthfully under oath if compelled by law to do so in
a deposition, lawsuit, or similar legal or dispute resolution proceeding;
making or publishing any such statements the Employee or the Employee's
controlled affiliate, as applicable, reasonably believes in good faith to be
necessary in responding to or initiating a bona fide legal claim
involving the Employee's or the Employee's controlled affiliate, as
applicable; filing a complaint, participating in an investigation, or
otherwise cooperating with any federal, state, or local fair employment agency
or other government or law enforcement agency.

  



  

7.6.   _Performance of Duties [and Practice of Law] 14 Not Affected_. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not restrict the Employee from
performing his duties as an officer, director, or employee of the Company or
any of its affiliates [nor shall anything in this Agreement prevent or
otherwise restrict the Employee in any way from engaging in the practice of
law or the providing of legal services to any person or business]15.

  



  

8.  Miscellaneous Provisions Governing Restrictive Covenants.

  



  

8.1.   _Reasonableness of Restrictions and Covenants_. The Employee hereby
confirms that the Employee was informed of the time, territory, scope and
other essential requirements of the restrictions set forth in Section 7 of
this Agreement when the Employee agreed to become employed with the Company
under the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Employee acknowledges that
the Company would not have entered into this Agreement had the Employee not
agreed to the restrictions set forth in Section 7 of the Agreement.
The Employee further acknowledges that the Employee has received sufficient
and valuable consideration for the Employee's agreement to such restrictions.
The Employee also agrees that the covenants and restrictions contained in this
Agreement are reasonable and valid and hereby agrees that the Company would
suffer irreparable injury in the event of any breach by the Employee of the
Employee's obligations under any such covenant or restriction. Accordingly,
the Employee hereby agrees that damages would be an inadequate remedy at law
in connection with any such breach and that the Company shall therefore be
entitled, in addition to any other right or remedy which it may have at law,
in equity or otherwise, to temporary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining
and restraining the Employee from any such breach. The Employee further
consents and stipulates to the entry of such injunctive relief without the
need to post any bond or other security.

  



  

8.2.   _Survival_. The provisions of Sections 7, 8, 9, 10.2 and 11 of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the
termination of the Employee's employment and regardless of the circumstances
that result in such termination. This provision shall not be construed to
limit the survival of any other provisions that also survive the termination
of this Agreement by the express or implied terms of such provisions.

  



  

8.3. _Enforcement, Severability, and Modification_. If, at the time of
enforcement of any provision of Section 7 of this Agreement, a court or
arbitrator holds that the restrictions stated in Section 7 of this Agreement
are unreasonable or unenforceable under the circumstances then existing, the
Parties agree that (i) the court/arbitrator should first reform the provisions
of Section 7 prior to severing any provisions, and if the court/arbitrator
will not or cannot reform such provisions, then the court/arbitrator may
sever provisions as described in this paragraph, (ii) the provisions of
Section 7 of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of such
provisions are, for any reason whatsoever, deemed invalid, void or
otherwise unenforceable, (iii) such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable
provisions in Section 7 of this Agreement shall be automatically replaced by
other provisions which are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid,
void or otherwise unenforceable provisions but are valid and enforceable, and
(iv) the remaining provisions in Section 7 of this Agreement shall remain
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

For a period of two (2) years following the Termination Date, the Employee
agrees to be reasonably available to assist and cooperate with the Company in
connection with any litigation, administrative proceedings, audits or other
governmental or regulatory inquiries. Such assistance and cooperation will,
when under the control of the Company, be at a mutually convenient time and
location and may include, without limitation, appearing for meetings,
consultations, depositions, hearings, or trials. The Company will reimburse
the Employee for reasonable, pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses
incurred in connection with providing such assistance and cooperation.

  



  

10. Disclosures

  



  

10.1.   _Upon Employment_. In entering into this Agreement, the Employee
represents and warrants that the Employee does not have any obligation,
whether express or implied, to any third party that would interfere with,
hamper, or limit the Employee's ability to provide any employment services or
to otherwise comply with the Employee's obligations under this Agreement. The
Employee explicitly represents and warrants to the Company that the Employee
is not a party to any confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation or
similar agreements with any third party, or to any agreement the terms of
which could prohibit the Employee from performing the Employee's employment
duties for the Company, or to any agreement which could be breached by the
Employee's entry into this Agreement and/or performance of the Employee's
employment duties for the Company.

  



  

10.2.   _Upon Termination of Employment_. For any period of time when the
restrictions referenced in Section 7 of this Agreement apply, the Employee
shall promptly notify any subsequent employer of the terms of this Agreement
to ensure that this Agreement is not breached by the Employee.

The Employee agrees that the Employee shall indemnify and hold the Company,
its subsidiaries and any affiliates thereof (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
harmless from and against any Taxes (as defined herein) imposed upon or
otherwise required to be paid by any Indemnified Party with respect to any
payments, rights or other transfers provided to the Employee by or with
respect to an Indemnified Party (including for the avoidance of doubt any
person who was an Indemnified Party prior to the Effective Time) on or prior
to the Effective Time. For purposes of the precedent sentence, " _Taxes_ "
shall mean taxes or other governmental charges (including any withholding,
employment, payroll, social security or other similar taxes) and any
penalties, interest, surcharges, additional to tax and deficiency
assessments with respect thereto. The Employee shall provide such security
for the foregoing indemnity obligations as the Company may reasonably request
from time to time.]16

12.1.   _Clawback Provisions_. Any amounts payable under this Agreement are
subject to any policy (whether in existence as of the Commencement Date or
later adopted or modified) established by the Company providing for
clawback or recovery of amounts that were paid to the Employee. The Company
will make any determination for clawback or recovery in its sole discretion
and in accordance with any applicable law or regulation.

  



  

12.2.   _Resignation of All Other Positions_. Upon termination of the
Employee's employment hereunder for any reason, the Employee agrees to resign

the Company Board and Parent Board (or a committee thereof) of the Company or
any of its affiliates.

  



  

12.3.   _Assignment and Successors_. This Agreement is intended to bind and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Employee, the Company, and
their respective successors and assigns, except that the Employee may not
assign any of the Employee's duties hereunder and the Employee may not assign
any of the Employee's rights hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Company. This Agreement is personal to the Employee and shall not be
assigned by the Employee. Any purported assignment by the Employee shall be
null and void from the initial date of the purported assignment. The Company
may assign this Agreement to any entity which controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with the Company, or to any successor or assign
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company and the
permitted successors and assigns.

  



  

12.4.   _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, or other communications

Employee at the Employee's address as shown in the Company's records.

  



  

12.5. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law. If any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be
or become illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part for any
reason, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. If
any court of competent jurisdiction should deem any covenant herein to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable because its scope is considered excessive,
such covenant shall be modified so that the scope of the covenant is reduced
only to the minimum extent necessary to render the modified covenant valid,
legal and enforceable.

requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance
promulgated thereunder (" _Section 409A_ ") or an exemption from Section 409A.
The Company shall undertake to administer, interpret, and construe this
Agreement in a manner that does not result in the imposition on the Employee
of any additional tax, penalty, or interest under Section 409A, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Employee understands and agrees that the Company shall
not be held liable or responsible for any taxes, penalties, interests or other
expenses incurred by the Employee on account of non-compliance with Section
409A.

  



  

(a)  For purposes of Section 409A, each installment payment or payroll
period amount provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate
payment.

  



  

(b)  A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any
amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless
such termination is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of
Section 409A.

  



  

(c)  If the Employee is deemed on the date of termination to be a "specified
employee" within the meaning of that term under Section 409A, then with
regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered
deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a "separation
from service," and that is not exempt from Section 409A as involuntary
separation pay or a short-term deferral (or otherwise), such payment or
benefit shall not be made or provided until the date which is the earlier of
(i) the first regular payroll date following the expiration of the six
(6)-month period measured from the date of such "separation from service" of
the Employee, or (ii) the date of the Employee's death (the " _Delay Period_
"). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits
delayed pursuant to this Section (whether they would have otherwise been
payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay)
shall be paid or reimbursed to the Employee in a lump sum without interest,
and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be
paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for
them herein.

agree that any dispute over this Agreement will be submitted to and settled
exclusively by binding arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of this
section, subject only to any applicable requirement of law that the Parties
engage in a preliminary non-binding mediation or arbitration.
Binding arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Service Streamlined Rules and Procedures (the " _JAMS
Rules_ "). Arbitration shall be held in Oakland County, Michigan, before an
arbitrator selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules who will have no personal or
pecuniary interest, either directly or indirectly, from any business or
family relationship with either of the Parties. All decisions of the
arbitrator will be final, binding, and conclusive on the Parties.

The Parties will equally share the costs of the arbitrator and the
arbitration fee (if any). Each Party will bear that Party's own
attorneys' fees and costs, and the prevailing Party will not be entitled to
reimbursement by the other Party of any of its fees or costs incurred in
connection with the arbitration hereunder, regardless of any rule to the
contrary in the applicable arbitration rules. Either Party may seek
confirmation of the arbitration award in the federal or state courts with
jurisdiction over Auburn Hills, Michigan and such court shall be the sole,
exclusive, and mandatory venue and jurisdiction for any disputes between the
Parties arising from or relating to this Agreement. If any action is filed,
by any party, relating to a breach of this Agreement and/or enforcement of
this Agreement, each Party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the federal and state courts with jurisdiction over Auburn Hills,
Michigan in any claim or action arising hereunder and waives any claim that
such court is an inconvenient forum.

  



  

12.9.   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER;
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION; AND AGREES THAT IF SUCH PARTY
SEEKS A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER PARTY MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT TO
THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. The waiver by a Party

12.15.  _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are intended solely for

F-20

 



    

  



       | 2.| Confidential Information.  
---|---|--- 
 



       | a.  | Employee acknowledges that all Confidential Information
constitutes a protectable business interest of the Company, and covenants and
agrees that at all times during the period of Employee's employment and
thereafter, Employee agrees (i) to hold in strictest confidence the
Confidential Information, (ii) not to, directly or indirectly, disclose,
furnish, or make available to any Person any Confidential Information without
prior written authorization from the Company, and (iii) not to use any
Confidential Information except during the term of Employee's employment in
the course of performing Employee's duties as an employee of the Company.
Employee will abide by the Company's policies and rules as may be established
from time to time by it for the protection of its Confidential Information and
will not make any copies of Confidential Information except as authorized by
the Company. Employee agrees that in the course of employment with the
Company, Employee will not bring to the Company's offices nor use for the
Company's benefit, nor disclose, furnish or make available to the Company or
any Company Affiliate, or induce the Company or any Company Affiliate to use,
any confidential or proprietary information or Tangible Embodiments belonging
to others. Employee's obligations under this _Section 2(a)_ with respect to
particular Confidential Information will survive expiration or termination of
this Agreement and Employee's employment with the Company, and will terminate
only at such time (if any) as the Confidential Information in question becomes
publicly and widely known to the public other than as a result of any wrongful
act of Employee or Employee's breach of this Agreement (or a breach by those
acting in concert with the Employee or on the Employee's behalf) or wrongful
act of any other Person who was under confidentiality obligations as to the
item or items involved. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | b.  | For clarity, Employee's agreements in this _Section 2_
are intended to be for the benefit of the Company, the Company Affiliates, and
any third party that has entrusted information or Tangible Embodiments to the
Company or the Company Affiliates in confidence. This Agreement is intended to
supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Company or the Company
Affiliates may have with respect to the protection of trade secrets or
confidential or proprietary information. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | c.  | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
an individual (including Employee) shall not be held criminally or civilly
liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a
trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state, or local
government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law. An individual (including Employee)
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any  federal or state
trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such
filing is made under seal. An individual (including Employee) who files a
lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of
law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use
the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files
any document containing the trade secret under seal, and does not disclose
the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to conflict with federal law protecting confidential disclosures
of a trade secret to the government or in a court filing, 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b),
or to create liability for disclosures of Confidential Information that are
expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b).

   | 3.| Return of Materials. Upon termination of employment with the
Company or otherwise upon the Company's request, and regardless of the reason
for such termination, Employee agrees to promptly return to the Company or
destroy all Tangible Embodiments of the foregoing in Employee's possession,
custody, or control that contain, summarize, abstract, or in any way reflect,
relate to, or embody any Confidential Information or any other information
concerning the Company, any of the Company Affiliates or any of its or their
products, services or clients, whether prepared by the Employee or others. At
the time Employee returns or destroys these materials (or otherwise upon the
Company's request), Employee will acknowledge to the Company, in writing and
under oath, in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ , that Employee has complied
with the terms of this _Section 3_.  
---|---|--- 
 



   | 4.| Work Product.  
---|---|--- 
 



       | a.  | Employee agrees to promptly and fully disclose in
writing to the Company all Work Product (including all original works of
authorship and all work product relating thereto). This disclosure will
include complete and accurate copies of all Tangible Embodiments of such Work
Product. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | b.  | Employee covenants and agrees that all Work Product and
Tangible Embodiments are and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Company. Employee acknowledges that all Work Product that are original works
of authorship Created by Employee (solely or jointly) within the scope of
Employee's employment are "works made for hire" to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law and as that term is under the United States
Copyright Act (17 U.S.C., et seq.). Without limiting the foregoing, Employee
hereby agrees to hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company
and hereby assigns (and without limiting the foregoing, agrees in the future
to assign) to the Company all of the entire worldwide right, title, and
interest in and to all Work Product (and Tangible Embodiments thereof)
throughout the world, without any requirement of further documentation or
consideration, including, for clarity, any and all patent rights, copyrights,
trademark rights, mask work rights, moral rights, _sui generis_ database
rights, and all other intellectual property rights therein or pertaining
thereto and all rights to prosecute, enforce, and sue for past, present and
future infringements, misappropriations or other violations thereof,
throughout the universe in perpetuity or for the longest period permitted by
law. Employee hereby waives and irrevocably quitclaims to the Company or its
designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that Employee now has
or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Work Product and/or
Tangible Embodiments and intellectual property rights related thereto. 
---|---|--- 
   



 

   

F-22

 



    

  



       | c.  | At any time during or after Employee's employment with
the Company, at the request of the Company or any of the Company Affiliates,
Employee agrees to perform, during and after employment, all acts deemed
necessary or desirable by the Company to permit and assist it, at the
Company's expense, in registering, recording, obtaining, maintaining,
defending, perfecting, enforcing, and/or assigning any Work Product and
Tangible Embodiments in any and all countries. In the event Employee refuses
or fails to perform such acts, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee's
agents and attorneys-in-fact to act for and in Employee's behalf and instead
of Employee, to execute and file any documents and to do all other lawfully
permitted acts to further the above purposes with the same legal force and
effect as if executed by Employee; this designation and appointment
constitutes an irrevocable power of attorney and is coupled with an interest. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | d.  | To the extent that such an assignment of any Work
Product and/or Tangible Embodiment is not permitted under applicable law,
Employee hereby grants to (and without limiting the foregoing, agrees in the
future to grant to) the Company an exclusive (even as to Employee), royalty-
free, fully paid up, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, sublicenseable and
transferable license to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works
of, use, publicly perform, display, sell, offer for sale, import, distribute,
and/or otherwise exploit such Work Product or Tangible Embodiment for any
commercial or internal business purposes and all other purposes. To the extent
not assignable, Employee hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any and all claims Employee may now or hereafter have in any
jurisdiction to any so-called "moral rights" in connection with the Work
Product and acknowledges and agrees that the Company may use, exploit,
distribute, reproduce, advertise, promote, publicize, alter, modify or edit
the Work Product or combine the Work Product with other works, in the
Company's sole discretion, in any format or medium hereafter devised. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | e.  | Without limiting the generality of any other provision
of this _Section 4_ , Employee hereby authorizes the Company and each of the
Company Affiliates to make any desired changes to any part of any Work
Product, to combine it with other materials in any manner desired, and to
withhold Employee's identity in connection with any distribution or use
thereof alone or in combination with other materials. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | f.  | The obligations of Employee set forth in this _Section
4_ (including, but not limited to, the assignment obligations) will continue
beyond the termination of Employee's employment with respect to Work Product
Created by Employee alone or jointly with others during Employee's employment
with the Company and for one (1) year thereafter, whether pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise.  These obligations will be binding upon Employee
and Employee's executors, administrators and other representatives.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

F-23

 



    



       | g.  | Employee agrees that Employee will register all domains,
usernames, handles, social media accounts and similar online accounts which
Employee registers on behalf of the Company and which relate to the Company or
its intellectual property rights (the " _Online Accounts_ ") in the name of
the Company, except to the extent that such requests by the Company are
prohibited by law. If any Online Account that is not (or by the terms of such
Online Account cannot be) registered in the name of the Company is registered
in Employee's name or under Employee's control, Employee agrees to assign
ownership and control of such Online Account to any Person designated by the
Company upon the Company's request. Employee agrees to use any Online Account,
whether registered in Employee's name or the name of the Company, in
compliance with any applicable policies or guidelines of the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | h.  | Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, this
Agreement does not apply to any Invention which qualifies as a non-assignable
Invention  under the provisions of California Labor Code Section 2870 ("
_Section 2870_ "), a copy of which is attached  as _Exhibit B_. Employee will
advise the Company promptly in writing of any Inventions  that Employee
believes fully qualify for protection under Section 2870; and Employee will at
that time provide to the  Company in writing all evidence necessary to
substantiate that belief. The Company will keep in confidence and will not
use  for any purpose or disclose to third parties without Employee's consent
any confidential information disclosed in writing  to the Company pursuant to
this Agreement relating to Inventions that qualify fully for protection under
the provisions of  Section 2870\. Employee will preserve the confidentiality
of any Invention that does not fully qualify for protection  under Section
2870\. BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EMPLOYEE HAS
RECEIVED _EXHIBIT B_ , WHICH SHALL  CONSTITUTE WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 2870. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| Excluded IP.  
---|---|--- 
 



       | a.  | As a matter of record, Employee has set forth on
_Exhibit C_ hereto a list with non-confidential descriptions of any and all
proprietary information, works of authorship, ideas, reports, creative works,
intellectual property or other Inventions which have been made by Employee
prior to employment with the Company and which are excluded from the scope of
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Excluded IP_ "). Employee hereby
represents and warrants that such list is accurate and complete. If no list is
attached (or if the list is empty), then Employee hereby represents and
warrants that there is no Excluded IP. Employee will not assert any right,
title or interest in or to any Work Product nor claim that Employee Created
any Work Product before Employee's employment with the Company unless Employee
has specifically identified that Invention as an Excluded IP on the attached
_Exhibit C_ prior to the execution of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | b.  | If in the course of Employee's employment, Employee uses
or incorporates into  any Work Product or Tangible Embodiment any
Inventions (including any Excluded IP) in which Employee or a third Person has
any interest and which is not covered by _Section 4(b)_ hereof, Employee will
promptly so inform the Company. Whether or not Employee gives such notice,
Employee hereby grants to (and without limiting the foregoing, agrees in the
future to grant to) the Company an exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up,
irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, sublicenseable and transferable license to
make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, publicly
perform, display, sell, offer for sale, import, distribute, and/or otherwise
exploit such Invention (including such Excluded IP) for any commercial or
internal business purposes and all other purposes.

F-24

 



    



  

   | 6.| Representations and Warranties.  
---|---|--- 
 



       | a.  | _No Conflicts_. Employee hereby represents and warrants
that Employee is not subject to any obligation to any third Person, including
any former employer, that would be inconsistent with any provision of this
Agreement, including with respect to any Excluded IP, and that Employee has
the right to grant the license and rights granted in _Section 5(b)_. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | b.  | _No Infringement_. Employee hereby represents and
warrants that all Excluded IP licensed to the Employer pursuant to _Section
5(b)_ do not (and all Work Product will not) infringe, misappropriate, dilute,
or otherwise violate any third Person's patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets, or other intellectual property rights or other rights. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| Equitable Remedies. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and
necessary for the protection of the Company's and the Company Affiliates'
business interests, that irreparable injury will result to the Company and
the Company Affiliates if Employee breaches any of the terms of said
covenants, and that in the event of Employee's actual or threatened breach of
any such covenants, the Company and the Company Affiliates will have no
adequate remedy at law. Employee accordingly agrees that, in the event of any
actual or threatened breach by Employee of any of said covenants, the Company
or any of the Company Affiliates, as applicable, will be entitled
to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without posting bond or
other security and without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages.
Nothing in this _Section 7_ will be construed as prohibiting the Company or
any of the Company Affiliates from pursuing any other remedies available to
it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of any damages
that it is able to prove.  
---|---|--- 
 



   | 8.| No Right to Employment. No provision of this Agreement shall give
Employee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of the
Company Affiliates, create any inference as to the length of employment
of Employee, affect the right of the Company or the Company Affiliates to
terminate the employment of Employee, with or without cause, or give Employee
any right to participate in any employee welfare or benefit plan or other
program of the Company or any of the Company Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Employee has executed a written employment agreement
with the Company, in the event of any direct and irresolvable conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and such employment agreement, the terms
of this Agreement shall control with respect to all Inventions and
Confidential Information, but otherwise the terms of the employment agreement
shall control.  
---|---|---

   | 9.| Modification and Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties. No term or
condition of this Agreement will be deemed to have been waived, except by
written instrument of the party charged with such waiver. No such written
waiver will be deemed to be a continuing waiver unless specifically
stated therein, and each such waiver will operate only as to the specific
term or condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of such term or
condition for the future or as to any act other than that specifically
waived.  
---|---|--- 
 



   | 10.| Severability. Employee acknowledges that the agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement are essential to protect the Company
and the Company Affiliates and their goodwill. Each of the covenants in this
Agreement will be construed as independent of any other covenants or other
provisions of this Agreement. If any court of competent jurisdiction at any
time deems the Restricted Period unreasonably lengthy or any of the covenants
set forth in this Agreement not fully enforceable, the other provisions of
this Agreement will nevertheless stand and to the full extent consistent with
law continue in full force and effect, and it is the intention and desire of
the parties that the court treat any provisions of this Agreement which
are not fully enforceable as having been modified to the extent deemed
necessary by the court to render them reasonable and enforceable and that the
court enforce them to such extent.  
---|---|--- 
 



   | 11.| Notices. Any notice, consent, waiver and other communications
required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed to have been properly given (a) when delivered by
hand; (b) five (5) days after sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested; or (c) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally

subsequent notices by giving written notice thereof to the other party in
accordance with this _Section 11_.

  



   | 12.| Headings. The headings and other captions in this Agreement are
included solely for convenience of reference and will not control the meaning
and interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
 



   | 13.| Governing Law. This Agreement has been executed in the State of
Michigan, and its validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement will
be governed by the laws of such state, except with respect to conflicts of
laws principles. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of

the benefit of Employee, the Company, the Company Affiliates, and their

---|---|--- 
   



   | 15.| No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any
person.

   | 16.| Waiver of Jury. THE COMPANY AND THE EMPLOYEE KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR

EXHIBIT A

  



  

My engagement by Electric Last Mile, Inc., (the " _Company_ ") is now
terminated. I have reviewed my Confidentiality, Inventions and Non-
Solicitation Agreement with the Company, dated ________________ ___, 20__ (the
" _Agreement_ "), and I hereby swear, under penalty of perjury, that:

  



   | ●| I have complied and will continue to comply with all of the
provisions of the Agreement.

   | ●| I understand that all of the Company's materials (including
without limitation, written or printed documents, email and computer disks or
tapes, whether machine or user readable, computer memory, and other
information reduced to any recorded format or medium), whether or not they
contain Confidential Information (as that phrase is defined in the
Agreement), are and remain the property of the Company. I have delivered to
authorized Company personnel, or have destroyed, all of those documents and
all other Company materials in my possession.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | ●| Any breach of my declarations hereunder would cause irreparable
injury to the Company for which monetary damages would not be an adequate
remedy and, therefore, will entitle the Company to injunctive relief
(including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to the
Company hereunder are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and
remedies available to the Company at law or in equity. I hereby acknowledge
that the Company shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees

_Corporation_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE II.

  



  

The address of the Corporation's registered office in the State of Delaware
is 251 Little Falls Drive, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle,
Delaware 19808, and the name of the registered agent at such address is

ARTICLE III.

  



  

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized and incorporated under the
Delaware General Corporation Law or any applicable successor act thereto, as
the same may be amended from time to time (the " _DGCL_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE IV.

  



  

A. The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be
designated, respectively, " _Common Stock_ " and " _Preferred Stock_." The
total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is
1,100,000,000 shares. 1,000,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, each having
a par value of one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001). 100,000,000 shares shall
be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of one-hundredth of one cent

H-1

 



    



  

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Third
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_ "), each
share of the Corporation's Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the " _Class B Common Stock_ "), that was issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated
and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
the Corporation's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "
_Class A Common Stock_ "). Immediately following the conversion of such Class
B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock, each share of Class A
Common Stock issued and outstanding shall, automatically and without further
action by any stockholder, be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock.

  



  

C. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is hereby
authorized to provide by resolution or resolutions from time to time for the
issuance, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, without stockholder approval, by filing a
certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Delaware (the "
_Preferred Stock Designation_ "), setting forth such resolution and, with
respect to each such series, establishing the number of shares to be included
in such series, and fixing the voting powers, full or limited, or no voting
power of the shares of such series, and the designation, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of the
shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof. The powers, designation, preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred
Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, if any,
may differ from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding.
The authority of the Board with respect to each series of Preferred Stock
shall include, but not be limited to, the determination of the following: (1)
the designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing number,
letter or title; (2) the number of shares of the series, which number the
Board may thereafter (except where otherwise provided in the Preferred Stock
Designation) increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding); (3) the amounts or rates at which dividends will be
payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the series in respect of
dividends, and whether such dividends, if any, shall be cumulative or
noncumulative; (4) the dates on which dividends, if any, shall be
payable; (5) the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of
the series; (6) the terms and amount of any sinking fund, if any, provided
for the purchase or redemption of shares of the series; (7) the amounts
payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the series in the event
of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation; (8) whether the shares of the series shall be
convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series, or
any other security, of the Corporation or any other corporation, and, if so,
the specification of such other class or series or such other security, the
conversion or exchange price or prices or rate or rates, any adjustments
thereof, the date or dates at which such shares shall be convertible or
exchangeable and all other terms and conditions upon which such conversion or
exchange may be made; (9) restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same
series or any other class or series; (10) the voting rights, if any, of the
holders of shares of the series generally or upon specified events; and (11)
any other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and any qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such shares, all as may be determined from
time to time by the Board and stated in the resolution or resolutions
providing for the issuance of such Preferred Stock.

  



  

   

H-2

 



    



  

D. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the Common
Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board upon any
issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.

  



  

E. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the resolution or resolutions
providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for
the election and removal of directors and for all other purposes. Each
outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote
on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for
their vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise required by
law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to
this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of
Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either
separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such
series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed
with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

  



  

F. Subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, holders of
shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and
distributions and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the
Corporation when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time
out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor.

  



  

G. Subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets and funds of the Corporation
available for distribution in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary. A liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, as such terms are used in this Article IV shall not be deemed to
be occasioned by or to include any consolidation or merger of the Corporation
with or into any other person or a sale, lease, exchange or conveyance of all
or a part of its assets.

  



  

ARTICLE V.

  



  

A. 

  



  

1\.  DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS. For the management of the business and for the
conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition,
limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation, of its directors
and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is
further provided that the management of the business and the conduct of the
affairs of the Corporation shall be vested in the Board. Subject to the
applicable requirements of the Director Nomination Agreement, dated as of
[___], [___] (as the same may be amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time, the " _Nomination Agreement_ "), the number of
directors constituting the Board shall be fixed exclusively by resolutions
adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors constituting the
Board.

  



  

   

H-3

 



    



  

2\. BOARD OF DIRECTORS. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under
specified circumstances, the directors shall be divided into three classes
designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Each class shall
consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one third of the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board. The Board is authorized to assign
members of the Board already in office to such classes at the time the
classification becomes effective. At the first annual meeting of stockholders
following the initial classification of the Board, the term of office of the
Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors shall be elected for a
full term of three years. At the second annual meeting of stockholders
following such initial classification, the term of office of the Class II
directors shall expire and Class II directors shall be elected for a full
term of three years. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following
such initial classification, the term of office of the Class III directors
shall expire and Class III directors shall be elected for a full term of
three years. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors
shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the directors of
the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, each director shall
serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier
death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

  



  

3\. REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable
law, any individual director or directors may be removed with cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all
then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally at an election of directors.

  



  

4\. VACANCIES. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law and
subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock and the
rights granted pursuant to the Nomination Agreement, any vacancies on the
Board resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other
causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
number of directors, shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of
the Board, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance
with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full
term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until
such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.

  



  

B. 

  



  

1\. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or
repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of
the Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board shall require the approval of a
majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also
have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation with, in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation required by law or by this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

   

H-4

 



    



  

2\. BALLOTS. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
ballot unless the Bylaws so provide.

  



  

3\. ACTION BY STOCKHOLDERS WITHOUT A MEETING. Any action properly brought
before the stockholders by or at the direction of the Board may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a written
consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by the holders of
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be voted with respect to the
subject matter thereof having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

  



  

4\. NOTICE. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of
directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in
the Bylaws of the Corporation.

  



  

5\. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation may be called only by (i) the Chair of the Board or President and
(ii) shall be called by the Chair of the Board, President or Secretary on the
written request of at least a majority of directors then in office, or the
sole director, as the case may be. The ability of the stockholders to call a
special meeting is hereby specifically denied.

  



  

ARTICLE VI.

  



  

A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it
may hereafter be amended, no director of the Corporation shall be personally
liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If applicable law is amended after
approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

  



  

B. The Corporation may indemnify, and advance expenses to, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any person who was or is a party to or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by
reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

  



  

   

H-5

 



    



  

C. No repeal or modification of this Article VI shall apply to or have any
adverse effect on any right, indemnification or protection of, or any
limitation of the liability of, a director of the Corporation existing at the
time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

  



  

ARTICLE VII.

  



  

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction, the federal district court for the
District of Delaware unless said court lacks subject matter jurisdiction in
which case the Superior Court of the State of Delaware) shall be the sole and
exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any
action asserting a claim arising under any provision of the DGCL, this Third
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or (d) any
action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except
for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court
of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for
which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, unless the Corporation
consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal
district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and
exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause
of action arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary,
the provisions of this Section A of this Article VII will not apply to suits
brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have
exclusive jurisdiction. If any action the subject matter of which is within
the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than a
court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign Action_ ") in the
name of any stockholder, then such stockholder shall be deemed to have
consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in
any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (ii) having service of
process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such
stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII.

  



  

The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity pursuant to Section
122(17) of the DGCL. An " _Excluded Opportunity_ " is any matter, transaction
or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or
which otherwise comes into the possession of (i) any director of the
Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, or (ii) any holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any
partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of any such holder,
other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, " _Covered Persons_ "), unless such matter,
transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by,
or otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and
solely in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the Corporation,
such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted
to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue,
and to the extent the director is permitted to refer that opportunity to the
Corporation without violating any legal or contractual obligation. Any
amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
VIII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director,
officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such
amendment, repeal or modification.

  



  

   

H-6

 



    



  

ARTICLE IX.

  



  

A. If any provision or provisions of this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i)
the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other
circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Third Certificate of
Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph
of this Third Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including,
without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Third Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit
the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from
personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for the benefit
of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

  



  

B. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as
provided in paragraph C. of this Article IX, and all rights conferred upon
the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

  



  

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might
otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative
vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Corporation
required by law or by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a
series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66

ARTICLE II 
 STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS

  



  

Section 2.1. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and time
and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the notice
of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine
that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_. At each
annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters shall elect
those directors of the Corporation to fill any term of a directorship that
expires on the date of such annual meeting and may transact any other
business as may properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with
these Bylaws.

  



  

Section 2.2. Special Meetings. Subject to the rights of the holders of any
outstanding series of the preferred stock of the Corporation (" _Preferred
Stock_ "), and to the requirements of applicable law, special meetings of
stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by the Chair of
the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant to a
resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and may not be called by any
other person. Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place,
either within or without the State of Delaware, and at such time and on such
date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the Corporation's

I-1

 



    



  

Section 2.3. Notices. Notice of each stockholders meeting stating the place,
if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote communication,
if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such meeting and the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting, shall be given in the manner permitted by _Section 9.3_ to each
stockholder entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, by the Corporation not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting unless otherwise
required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "). If said notice is for a stockholder meeting other than an annual
meeting, it shall in addition state the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called, and the business transacted at such meeting shall be
limited to the matters so stated in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or
any supplement thereto). Notices of meetings to stockholders may be given by
mailing the same, addressed to the stockholder entitled thereto, at such
stockholder's mailing address as it appears on the records of the Corporation
and such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. mail,
postage prepaid. Without limiting the manner by which notices of meetings
otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any such notice may be
given by electronic transmission in accordance with applicable law. Notice of
any meeting need not be given to any stockholder who shall, either before or
after the meeting, submit a waiver of notice or who shall attend such
meeting, except when the stockholder attends for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Any stockholder so waiving notice of the meeting shall be bound by the
proceedings of the meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been
given. Any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be
postponed, and any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given
may be cancelled, by the Board upon Public Disclosure (as defined in _Section
2.7(a)(ii)_ ) given before the date previously scheduled for such meeting.

  



  

Section 2.4. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended or
restated from time to time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") or these
Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, at a stockholders meeting of the
holders of shares of outstanding capital stock of the
Corporation representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting,
except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series of
stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series shall
constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of
such business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at
any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chair of the meeting
may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in _Section
2.6_ until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly convened
meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
quorum.

  



   

I-2

 



    



  

Section 2.5. Voting of Shares.

  



  

(a) _Voting Lists_. The Secretary of the Corporation (the " _Secretary_ ")
shall prepare, or shall cause the officer or agent who has charge of the
stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare and make, at least 10 days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record
entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that if the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before
the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as
of the 10th day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and
showing the address and the number and class of shares registered in the name
of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall
require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other
electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a
period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of
the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the
list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable
steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole
time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If a
meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication
as permitted by _Section 9.5(a)_ , the list shall be open to the examination
of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting, as provided by
applicable law, on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
meeting. Except as provided by applicable law, the stock ledger shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list
required by this _Section 2.5(a)_  or to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(b) _Manner of Voting_. At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board,
the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote
communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic
transmission (as defined in _Section 9.3(c)_ ), provided that any such
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in
its discretion, or the chair of the meeting of stockholders, in such person's
discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by
written ballot.

  



  

(c) _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Proxies need not be
filed with the Secretary until the meeting is called to order, but shall be
filed with the Secretary before being voted or the delivery of a consent
action in writing to the Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.9_. Without
limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or
persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall
constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. No
stockholder shall have cumulative voting rights.

  



  

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

  



   

I-3

 



    



  

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like
agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to
receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the
stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or
persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu
of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the
original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

  



  

(d) _Required Vote_. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at
all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of
directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. All other matters presented to the stockholders at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a
majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the
matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different
vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the
decision of such matter.

  



  

(e) _Inspectors of Election_. In advance of any meeting of the stockholders,
the Board shall appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the
Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a
written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting, the person presiding at
the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall
take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The
inspector or inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to
assist the inspector or inspectors in the performance of their duties. In
determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any
meeting of stockholders, the inspector or inspectors may consider such
information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate
for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. When
executing the duties of inspector, the inspector or inspectors shall: (i)
ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each; (ii)
determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies
and ballots; (iii) count all votes and ballots; (iv) determine and retain for
a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any
determination by the inspectors; and (v) certify their determination of the
number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and
ballots.

  



   

I-4

 



    



  

Section 2.6. Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may be adjourned by the chair of the meeting, from time to time, whether or
not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place, if any.
Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and
place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by
which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person
and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the stockholders, or the
holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote separately as a
class, as the case may be, may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30
days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record
date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in
accordance with _Section 9.2_ , and shall give notice of the adjourned
meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned
meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 2.7. Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals.

  



  

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(i) At a meeting of the stockholders, only such nominations of persons for
the election of directors and such other business shall be conducted as shall
have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before
an annual meeting, nominations or such other business must be: (A) made
pursuant to the Director Nomination Agreement, dated as of [___], [___] (as
the same may be amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from
time to time, the " _Nomination Agreement_ "); (B) specified in the notice of
meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board
or any committee thereof; (C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting
by or at the direction of the Board or any committee thereof; or
(D) otherwise properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder who
is a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time such notice of
meeting is delivered, who is entitled to vote at the meeting, and who complies
with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_.

  



  

(ii) In addition, any proposal of business (other than the nomination of
persons for election to the Board) must be a proper matter for stockholder
action. For business (including, but not limited to, director nominations) to
be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to
_Section 2.7(a)(i)(D)_ , the stockholder or stockholders of record intending
to propose the business (the " _Proposing Stockholder_ ") must have given
timely notice thereof pursuant to this _Section 2.7(a)_ , in writing to the
Secretary even if such matter is already the subject of any notice to the
stockholders or Public Disclosure from the Board. To be timely, a Proposing
Stockholder's notice for an annual meeting must be delivered to the Secretary
at the principal executive offices of the Corporation: (x) not later than the
close of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on
the 120th day, in advance of the anniversary of the previous year's annual
meeting if such meeting is to be held on a day which is not more than 30 days
in advance of the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting or not
later than 60 days after the anniversary of the previous year's annual
meeting; and (y) with respect to any other annual meeting of stockholders,
including in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year,
not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of: (1) the
90th day prior to the annual meeting and (2) the close of business on the 10th
day following the first date of Public Disclosure of the date of such
meeting. In no event shall the Public Disclosure of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual meeting commence a new notice time period (or
extend any notice time period). For the purposes of this _Section 2.7_ , "
_Public Disclosure_ " shall mean a disclosure made in a press release reported
by the Dow Jones News Services, The Associated Press, or a comparable
national news service or in a document filed by the Corporation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

(b) _Stockholder Nominations_. For the nomination of any person or persons
for election to the Board pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)(D)_  or _Section
2.7(d)_ , a Proposing Stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth or
include: (i) the name, age, business address, and residence address of each
nominee proposed in such notice; (ii) the principal occupation or employment
of each such nominee; (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by each such
nominee (if any); (iv) such other information concerning each such nominee as
would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for
the election of such nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an
election contest is not involved) or that is otherwise required to be
disclosed, under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act; (v) a written statement
executed by each such nominee acknowledging that such person consents to being
named in the Company's proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected, and (vi) as to the Proposing Stockholder: (A) the name
and address of the Proposing Stockholder as they appear on the Corporation's
books and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is
being made, (B) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are
owned by the Proposing Stockholder (beneficially and of record) and owned by
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, as
of the date of the Proposing Stockholder's notice, and a representation that
the Proposing Stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing of the class
and number of such shares owned of record and beneficially as of the record
date for the meeting within five business days after the record date for such
meeting, (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding
with respect to such nomination between or among the Proposing Stockholder or
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made
and any of their affiliates or associates, and any others (including their
names) acting in concert with any of the foregoing, and a representation that
the Proposing Stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing of any such
agreement, arrangement, or understanding in effect as of the record date for
the meeting within five business days after the record date for such
meeting, (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding
(including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options,
hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered
into as of the date of the Proposing Stockholder's notice by, or on behalf
of, the Proposing Stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf
the nomination is being made and any of their affiliates or associates, the
effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit
of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of such
person or any of their affiliates or associates with respect to shares of
stock of the Corporation, and a representation that the Proposing Stockholder
will notify the Corporation in writing of any such agreement, arrangement, or
understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting within five
business days after the record date for such meeting, (E) a representation
that the Proposing Stockholder is a holder of record of shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person or
by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the
notice, and (F) a representation whether the Proposing Stockholder intends to
deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the
percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve
the nomination and/or otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in
support of the nomination.

  



   

I-6

 



    



  

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such
proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or
that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the
independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. Any such update or supplement
shall be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive
offices no later than five business days after the request by the Corporation
for subsequent information has been delivered to the Proposing Stockholder.

  



  

(c) _Other Stockholder Proposals_. For all business other than director
nominations, a Proposing Stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth as to each matter the Proposing Stockholder proposes to bring before the
annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting; (ii) the reasons for conducting such business at
the annual meeting; (iii) the text of any proposal or business (including the
text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such
business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the
proposed amendment); (iv) any substantial interest (within the meaning of
Item 5 of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act) in such business of such
stockholder and the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act), if any, on whose behalf the business is being proposed; (v)
any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, required to be disclosed in
a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with
solicitations of proxies for the proposal and pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder; (vi) a description of all agreements, arrangements,
or understandings between or among such stockholder, the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, any of their affiliates or
associates, and any other person or persons (including their names) in
connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of
such stockholder, beneficial owner, or any of their affiliates or associates,
in such business, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such
stockholder, beneficial owner, or their affiliates or associates; and (vii)
the information required by _Section 2.7(b)(vi)_ above.

  



  

(d) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(i) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the
Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders called by the Board at
which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of
meeting: (i) as provided in the Nomination Agreement, (ii) by or at the
direction of the Board or any committee thereof, or (iii) provided that the
Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any
stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the
notice provided for in this _Section 2.7(d)_ is delivered to the Secretary,
who is entitled to vote at the meeting, and upon such election and who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_.

  



   

I-7

 



    



  

(ii) In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for
the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such
stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a
person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as
specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if such stockholder delivers
a stockholder's notice that complies with the requirements of _Section
2.7(b)_ to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of
the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior
to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later
of: (x) the 90th day prior to such special meeting; or (y) the 10th day
following the date of the first Public Disclosure of the date of the special
meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such
meeting. In no event shall the Public Disclosure of an adjournment or
postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any
notice time period).

  



  

(e) _Effect of Noncompliance_. Only such persons who are nominated in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_  shall be
eligible to be elected at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to
serve as directors and only such other business shall be conducted at a
meeting as shall be brought before the meeting in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_. If any proposed nomination was
not made or proposed in compliance with this _Section 2.7_ , or other business
was not made or proposed in compliance with this _Section 2.7_ , then except
as otherwise required by law, the chair of the meeting shall have the power
and duty to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such
proposed other business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding anything in
these Bylaws to the contrary, unless otherwise required by law, if a
Proposing Stockholder intending to propose business or make nominations at an
annual meeting or propose a nomination at a special meeting pursuant to this
_Section 2.7_ does not provide the information required under this _Section
2.7_ to the Corporation, including the updated information required by
_Section 2.7(b)(vi)(B)_ , _Section 2.7(b)(vi)(C)_ , and _Section
2.7(b)(vi)(D) _ within five business days after the record date for such
meeting or the Proposing Stockholder (or a qualified representative of the
Proposing Stockholder) does not appear at the meeting to present the proposed
business or nominations, such business or nominations shall not be
considered, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such business or
nominations may have been received by the Corporation.

  



  

(f) _Rule 14a-8_. This _Section 2.7_ shall not apply to a proposal proposed
to be made by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation
of the stockholder's intention to present the proposal at an annual or special
meeting only pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange
Act and such proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has
been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such meeting.

  



  

(g) In addition to the provisions of this _Section 2.7_ , a stockholder shall
also comply with all of the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
herein. Nothing in this _Section 2.7_ shall be deemed to affect any rights of
the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to the
Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.7_ to the contrary, in the event
that the number of directors in an Expiring Class is increased and there is
no Public Disclosure of the appointment of a director to such class, or, if no
appointment was made, of the vacancy in such class, made by the Corporation
at least 10 days before the last day a stockholder may deliver a notice of
nomination in accordance with _Section 2.7_ , a stockholder's notice required
by this _Section 2.7_ and which complies with the requirements in _Section
2.7(b)_ , other than the timing requirements in _Section 2.7(a)_ , shall also
be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
in such Expiring Class created by such increase, if it is received by the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later
than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such
Public Disclosure is first made by the Corporation. For purposes of this
section, an " _Expiring Class_ " means a class of directors whose term shall
expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.7_
, for as long as the Nomination Agreement remains in effect, Forum Investors
III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company shall not be subject to the
notice procedures set forth in _Section 2.7(a)(ii)_ , _Section 2.7(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 2.7(h)_ with respect to any annual or special meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

Section 2.8. Conduct of Meetings. The chair of each annual and special

directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall be
filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in
office, even though less than a quorum of the Board, or by a sole remaining
director, and not by the stockholders, _provided, however_ , that whenever
the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to
elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or the Nomination Agreement, vacancies and newly created
directorships of such class or classes or series shall be filled by a
majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series
thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected, and not
by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding
sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the director
for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such director's
successor shall have been elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board shall
be deemed to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or

and may be paid either a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the
Board or other compensation as director. The directors may be reimbursed
their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board. No such
payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other

Corporation that is enforceable in accordance with _Section 7.8(a)_ ; and

  



   

I-18

 



    



  

(v) such other conditions for such transfer as shall be provided for under
applicable law have been satisfied.

records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive dividends or
notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise all the
rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person who is the
beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person) may, upon providing documentary evidence of beneficial
ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions as are provided
under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and records of the
Corporation.

(a) A written restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of
shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the Corporation that
may be owned by any person or group of persons, if permitted by the DGCL and
noted conspicuously on the certificate representing such shares or, in the
case of uncertificated shares, contained in a notice, offering circular or
prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of such shares
within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or transfer of such
shares, may be enforced against the holder of such shares or any successor or
transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee,
guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person
or estate of the holder.

  



  

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the
registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the
Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if
otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of
such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction
is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares are
uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice, offering
circular or prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of
such shares within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or
transfer of such shares.

  



  

Section 7.9. Regulations. The Board shall have power and authority to make
such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable requirement
of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with respect to the
issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock or
certificates representing shares. The Board may appoint one or more transfer
agents or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that
certificates representing shares bear the signature of any transfer agent or
registrar so appointed.

ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1. Right to Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "),
by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the
legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other
enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (hereinafter an " _Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered
and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding;
provided, however, that, with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

Section 8.2. Right to Advancement of Expenses. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in _Section 8.1_ , an Indemnitee shall also have
the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited
by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees) actually and reasonably incurred in defending or otherwise
participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition
(hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); provided, however, that an
advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the
Corporation's receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "),
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise. Payment of such expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by such person, may be made by the
Corporation, subject to such terms and conditions as the general counsel of
the Corporation in his or her discretion deems appropriate.

  



  

Section 8.3. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights provided to any Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any other right,
which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, an agreement, a vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of
its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and
advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL.

  



   

I-20

 



    



  

Section 8.4. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent
of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, enterprise, or nonprofit entity against any liability
asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,
or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.5. Indemnification of Other Persons; Other Indemnification. This
_Article VIII_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and
in the manner authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance
expenses to persons other than Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to
any employee or agent of the Corporation and to any other person who is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan,
to the fullest extent of the provisions of this _Article VIII_ with respect
to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees under this
_Article VIII_. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person
who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise
or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as
indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity.

  



  

Section 8.6. Amendments. Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this
Article _VIII_ shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder
of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of
such repeal or modification.

  



  

Section 8.7. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , (a)
references to " _other enterprise_ " shall include any employee benefit plan;
(b) references to " _fines_ " shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to " _serving
at the request of the Corporation_ " shall include any service that imposes
duties on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner " _not opposed to the best interest
of the Corporation_ " for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.8. Contract Rights. The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue
as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or
employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors
and administrators.

  



   

I-21

 



    



  

Section 8.9. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this _Article VIII_  shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of this
_Article VIII_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 9.1. Place of Meetings. If the place of any meeting of stockholders,
the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these
Bylaws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall be
held at the principal business office of the Corporation; provided, however,
if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a meeting shall not
be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of remote
communication pursuant to _Section 9.5_ hereof, then such meeting shall not
be held at any place.

  



  

Section 9.2. Fixing Record Dates.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless
the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date
on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or
an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 9.2(a)_ at
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be
more than 10 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by Chapter 1
of the DGCL, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware,
its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by
hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is
required by Chapter 1 of the DGCL, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

  



   

I-22

 



    



  

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 9.3. Means of Giving Notice.

  



  

(a) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any director,
such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a
nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of facsimile
telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or (iii) by oral
notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director will be
deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by
telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the
United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage
and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited
with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at
the director's address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if
sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission
number for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if
sent by electronic mail, when sent to the electronic mail address for such
director appearing on the records of the Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any
other form of electronic transmission, when sent to the address, location or
number (as applicable) for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Notice to Stockholders_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any
stockholder, such notice may be given (i) in writing and sent either by hand
delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally recognized
overnight delivery service for next day delivery, or (ii) by means of a form
of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder, to the extent
permitted by, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 232 of the
DGCL. A notice to a stockholder shall be deemed given as follows: (i) if given
by hand delivery, when actually received by the stockholder, (ii) if sent
through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with
postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the
stockholder's address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation, (iii)
if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery
service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid,
addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address appearing on the
stock ledger of the Corporation, and (iv) if given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given and
otherwise meeting the requirements set forth above, (A) if by facsimile
transmission, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice, (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice, (C) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specified posting, upon the later of (1)
such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (D) if by any
other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. A
stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent to receiving notice by
means of electronic communication by giving written notice of such revocation
to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or to the
Corporation's transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of
notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as
a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.

  



   

I-23

 



    



  

(c) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means any form
of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such
a recipient through an automated process, including but not limited to
transmission by telex, facsimile telecommunication, electronic mail, telegram
and cablegram.

  



  

(d) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall
be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an
address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such
notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

  



  

(e) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_. Whenever notice is required to be
given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to
any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to
such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any
governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice
to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without
notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the
same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that
the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given
to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with
whom communication is unlawful.

  



  

   

I-24

 



    



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to
any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of
action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such
stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings,
or (2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of
dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been
mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as shown
on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the
giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action
or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder
shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.
If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written
notice setting forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement
that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event
that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not
state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to
be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection
(1) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the
notice was given by electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 9.4. Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, a
written waiver of such notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to
said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to such required notice. All such waivers shall be kept with the
books of the Corporation. Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except where a person attends for the express
purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that
the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.5. Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment.

  



  

(a) _Stockholder Meetings_. If authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board
may adopt, stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and proxy holders
not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote
communication:

  



  

(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means
of remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted
to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or
proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the meeting and, if entitled to vote, to vote on matters
submitted to the applicable stockholders, including an opportunity to read or
hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such
proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other
action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such votes
or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Board Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board or any
committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other
and be heard. Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in
person at the meeting.

  



  

   

I-25

 



    



  

Section 9.6. Dividends. The Board may from time to time declare, and the
Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the
Corporation's capital stock) on the Corporation's outstanding shares of
capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate of
Incorporation.

  



  

Section 9.7. Reserves. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside
out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums
as the Board from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as
a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or
for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for
such other purpose as the Board shall think conducive to the interests of the
Corporation, and the Board may modify or abolish any such reserve in the
manner in which it was created.

  



  

Section 9.8. Contracts and Negotiable Instruments. Except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument may be executed
and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by such officer or
officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as the Board may
from time to time authorize. Such authority may be general or confined to
specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chair of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any contract, bond,
deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the
Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board, the Chair of
the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to execute
and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in
the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or employees of
the Corporation under such person's supervision and authority, it being
understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not relieve such
officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such delegated
power. All checks, notes, drafts, or other orders for the payment of money of
the Corporation shall be signed, endorsed, or accepted in the name of the
Corporation by such officer, officers, person, or persons as from time to
time may be designated by the Board or by an officer or officers authorized by
the Board to make such designation.

  



  

Section 9.9. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed
by the Board.

  



  

Section 9.10. Seal. The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in
such form as the Board determines. The seal may be used by causing it or a
facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced, as may be
prescribed by law or by the Board.

  



  

Section 9.11. Books and Records. The books and records of the Corporation may
be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as
may from time to time be designated by the Board. Any records administered by
or on behalf of the Corporation in the regular course of its business,
including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be
maintained on any information storage device, method, or one or more
electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed
electronic networks or databases); provided that the records so kept can be
converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time, and, with
respect to the stock ledger, the records so kept comply with Section 224 of
the DGCL. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the
request of any person entitled to inspect such records pursuant to applicable
law.

  



   

I-26

 



    



  

Section 9.12. Surety Bonds. Such officers, employees and agents of the
Corporation (if any) as the Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer,
President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the
faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other
property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control
belonging to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such surety companies as
the Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may
determine. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and the
bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary.

  



  

Section 9.13. Securities of Other Corporations. Powers of attorney, proxies,
waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other instruments
relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in the name of
and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chair of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer, President, any Vice President or any officers authorized by the
Board. Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf of the
Corporation, take all such action as any such officer may deem advisable to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of security holders of any
corporation in which the Corporation may own securities, or to consent in
writing, in the name of the Corporation as such holder, to any action by such
corporation, and at any such meeting or with respect to any such consent
shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and power incident to the
ownership of such securities and which, as the owner thereof, the Corporation
might have exercised and possessed. The Board may from time to time confer
like powers upon any other person or persons.

  



  

Section 9.14. Amendments. The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also
may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided,
however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
a majority of the voting power (except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.6_
) of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or
repeal the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 9.15. Exclusive Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to
the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware unless said court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction in which case the Superior Court of the State of Delaware)
shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other
employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's
stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising under any provision of
the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws or (d) any action
asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for,
as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for
which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, unless
the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum,
the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole
and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the
provisions of this _Section 9.15_ will not apply to suits brought to enforce
a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which
the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. If any action the subject
matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, then such stockholder shall be
deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (ii)
having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by
service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for
such stockholder.

to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 10, 2020 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and
Jason Luo, in the capacity as the initial Stockholder Representative in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. Any
capitalized term used but not defined in this Letter of Transmittal will have
the meaning ascribed to such term in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, among other matters, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "
_Merger_ "). At the effective time of the Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "):
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for (x) the number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the _quotient obtained by
dividing_ (A) the Aggregate Consideration Value _less_ the Earnout Share
Value, _less_  the Adjustment Escrow Amount, _by_ (B) $10.00 _by_ (C) the
Fully Diluted Share Number, (y) the contingent right to receive its portion
of the Earnout Shares (if any) after the Closing if payable subject to and in
accordance with Section 2.10 of the Merger Agreement and (z) the contingent
right to receive its portion of the Adjustment Escrow Stock (if any) after the
Closing if payable subject to and in accordance with Section 2.7 of the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

The undersigned (" _Pre-Closing Holder_ ") legal and beneficial owner of
Company Common Stock understands that this Letter of Transmittal is
being provided to both the Company and the Parent in connection with, and as
a condition to the consummation to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and that the Company and the Parent
are consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement in reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of Pre-Closing Holder set forth in this Letter of Transmittal.

  



  

IN ADDITION, PRE-CLOSING HOLDER HAS READ, UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES TO ALL OF
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY
DOCUMENTS TO WHICH THE PRE-CLOSING HOLDER IS BOUND, THE MATERIALS
ACCOMPANYING THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND THE ACCOMPANYING
INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE COMPLETING ANY OF THE INFORMATION BELOW. THE PRE-CLOSING
HOLDER UNDERSTANDS AND, BY VIRTUE OF THE PRE-CLOSING HOLDER'S EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, THE PRE-CLOSING HOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES AND WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THAT THE MERGER CONSIDERATION
SCHEDULE DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY CERTIFICATE.

  



  

   

J-4

 



    



  

Please read carefully this entire Letter of Transmittal and the accompanying
instructions before completing any of the boxes below.

  



  

1. _Representations and Warranties of Pre-Closing Holder_. Pre-Closing Holder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the Company and the Parent as follows as of the date of this Letter of Transmittal and as of the Effective Time:

  



  

(a) _Ownership of Securities_. All of the shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Pre-Closing Holder are set forth and accurately described in
_Schedule 1_ below. Pre-Closing Holder has beneficial ownership over, is the
lawful owner of, and has good and valid title to, the Company Common Stock,
free and clear of any and all Liens, proxies, voting agreements, adverse
claims, and demands of any nature or kind whatsoever (other than those
imposed by applicable securities laws and the Company's Organizational
Documents, each as in effect on the date hereof). There are no claims for
finder's fees or brokerage commission or other like payments in connection
with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby payable by
Pre-Closing Holder pursuant to arrangements made by such Pre-Closing Holder.
Except for convertible promissory notes issued by the Company and held by the
Pre-Closing Holder and the Company Common Stock in each case set forth on
_Schedule 1_ , Pre-Closing Holder is not a beneficial owner or record holder
of any: (i) equity interests of the Company or (ii) securities of the Company
having the right to vote on any matters on which the holders of equity
interests of the Company may vote.

  



  

(b) _Binding Agreement_. Pre-Closing Holder, (i) if a natural person, is of
legal age to execute this Letter of Transmittal and each of the Exhibits
hereto, including without limitation the Registration Rights Agreement and
Stockholder Support Agreement and any other document required by this Letter
of Transmittal (collectively, with the Letter of Transmittal, the "
_Transmittal Documents_ "), and is legally competent to do so, and (ii) if
not a natural person, is (A) a corporation or other entity duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
(B) has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver the
Transmittal Documents, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. If Pre-
Closing Holder is not a natural person, the execution and delivery of the
Transmittal Documents, the performance of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby by Pre-Closing Holder has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or similar action on the part of Pre-Closing Holder. This Letter of
Transmittal and each other Transmittal Document, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto and thereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Pre-Closing Holder,
enforceable against Pre-Closing Holder in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  



  

   

J-5

 



    



  

(c) _No Conflicts_. No filing with, or notification to, any Governmental
Entity, and no consent, approval, authorization or other Permit of any other
Person is necessary for the execution of this Letter of Transmittal or any
other Transmittal Document by Pre-Closing Holder, the performance of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. None of the execution and
delivery of this Letter of Transmittal or any other Transmittal Document by
Pre-Closing Holder, the performance of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder or the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of the
Organizational Documents of Pre-Closing Holder, if applicable, (ii) result
in, or give rise to, a violation or breach of or a default under any of the
terms of any Contract or obligation to which Pre-Closing Holder is a party or
by which Pre-Closing Holder or any of the Company Common Stock or its other
assets may be bound, or (iii) to the actual knowledge of Pre-Closing Holder,
violate any applicable Law or Order, except for any of the foregoing
in clauses (i) through (iii) as would not reasonably be expected to impair in
any material respect Pre-Closing Holder's ability to perform its obligations
under this Letter of Transmittal or the other Transmittal Documents.

  



  

2. _Disposition of Company Common Stock_. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Pre-Closing Holder hereby surrenders, cancels and terminates Pre-Closing Holder's Company Common Stock, if any, in exchange for Pre-Closing Holder's applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. Pre-Closing Holder hereby authorizes and instructs Parent to make entries in its books and records to record and give effect to the issue and allotment of the portion of Merger Consideration due to Pre-Closing Holder as a result of the Merger, if any, in the name of and deliver to the address indicated below (unless otherwise instructed in _Schedule 1_ hereto).

  



  

3. _Appointment of the Stockholder Representative to Act on Pre-Closing Holder 's Behalf_. By the execution and delivery of this Letter of Transmittal, Pre-Closing Holder on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby agrees to the provisions of Article VIII of the Merger Agreement and irrevocably constitutes and appoints Jason Luo, in his capacity as the Stockholder Representative as set forth in the Merger Agreement, as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of Pre-Closing Holder with full powers of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of thereof with respect to the performance on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holder to the extent set forth in Article VIII of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

   

J-6

 



    



  

4. _Confidentiality_. Pre-Closing Holder hereby agrees for a period of five (5) years from and after the date hereof to, and to cause its heirs, past, present or future directors, managers, employees, partners, equityholders, agents, attorneys, advisors, representatives, successors, assigns, including, without limitation, any receiver, any assignee for the benefit of creditors or any trustee under the United States Bankruptcy Code or similar Law, and Affiliates (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to: (i) treat and hold in strict confidence any Company Confidential Information, and not use for any purpose (except solely in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Letter of Transmittal, the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document, performing its obligations hereunder or thereunder or enforcing its rights hereunder or thereunder), nor directly or indirectly disclose, distribute, publish, disseminate or otherwise make available to any third party any of the Company Confidential Information without the Company's and the Parent's prior written consent (except for (A) for disclosures to Pre-Closing Holder's Representatives, in each case with a bona fide need to know, _provided_ , that such persons and entities have agreed to the confidentiality restrictions contained herein or (B) if such Company Confidential Information has otherwise been made public other than as a result of a breach by Pre-Closing Holder of its confidentiality obligations under this Letter of Transmittal (including its obligations with respect to Pre-Closing Holder's Representatives; _provided_ , that Pre-Closing Holder shall be responsible for any disclosure by any such Representative not permitted by this Letter of Transmittal) or pursuant to a separate confidentiality obligation to the Company or Parent); and (ii) in the event that Pre-Closing Holder or any of Pre-Closing Holder's Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose (after Pre-Closing Holder or any of Pre-Closing Holder's Representatives have used their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure and after promptly advising and consulting with the Company and Parent about their intention to make, and the proposed contents of, such disclosure) any Company Confidential Information (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), (1) provide the Company and the Parent with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Company and the Parent may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this _Section 4_ and (2) in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Company and the Parent waive compliance with this _Section 4_ , furnish only that portion of such Company Confidential Information that is legally required to be provided or to avoid sanction for contempt or any similar sanction, in each case, as advised in writing by outside counsel, and to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such Company Confidential Information so disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Pre-Closing Holder is already subject to confidentiality obligations to the Company which are in effect as of the Closing Date which provide that such confidentiality obligations are the sole confidentiality provisions with respect to the Company applicable to Pre-Closing Holder, then those confidentiality obligations will apply to Pre-Closing Holder in lieu of the provisions of this _Section 4_. " _Company Confidential Information_ " means any and all confidential, proprietary documents, information or trade secret information of or pertaining to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, their business, or affairs, as well as any and all information entrusted to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in confidence by third parties, in each case, whether disclosed, directly or indirectly, verbally, in writing or by any other means in tangible or intangible form, including that which is made, created, authored, discovered, developed, invented, conceived, or reduced to practice (" _Created_ ") by Company and/or its Subsidiaries, Pre-Closing Holder, or any of their respective Representatives. Company Confidential Information includes, without limitation, all Company Developments, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, improvements, research, product or service ideas or plans, software (whether in source code or object code), designs, developments, processes, formulas, techniques, materials, specifications, mask works, design, drawings, hardware configuration information, information relating to existing or potential employees, consultants, clients, suppliers, vendors, or other service providers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives (including, but not limited to, their names, contact information, jobs, compensation and expertise), information relating to suppliers and customers, servicing methods, equipment, programs, or strategies, information relating to stockholders or lenders, price lists, pricing methodologies, cost data, market share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information, business plans, financial forecasts, financial statements, profit margins, sales information, historical financial data, budgets or other business information. Confidential Information also means all similar information disclosed to the Company by third parties, which is subject to confidentiality obligations. For purposes hereof, (a) " _Development_ " means any invention, modification, idea, discovery, design, development, improvement, process, software, work of authorship, documentation, formula, data, technique, know-how, trade secret, trademark, technology, or other intellectual property whatsoever or any interest therein (whether or not patentable, copyrightable, or otherwise registrable under similar statutes or subject to analogous protection) (together with all intellectual property rights therein or arising therefrom); and (b) " _Company Development_ " means any Development that Company, solely or jointly with others, Creates, including as such Development relates to or result from the actual or anticipated business, work, products, services, research, or strategies of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives or which are suggested by, relate to, or result from any task assigned to or performed for the benefit of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 4_ shall not restrict any Pre-Closing Holder from performing his or her duties as an officer, director or employee of the Company.

5. _Release of Claims_. In consideration of the receipt of his, her or its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration (which may be increased to decreased pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Merger Agreement), Pre-Closing Holder, intending to be legally bound, effective as of the Effective Time, for himself, herself or itself and on behalf of all of his, her or its heirs, past, present or future directors, managers, employees, partners, equityholders, agents, attorneys, advisors, representatives, successors, assigns, including, without limitation, any receiver, any assignee for the benefit of creditors or any trustee under the United States Bankruptcy Code or similar Law, and Affiliates (collectively, " _Releasors_ ") hereby releases and discharges the Company and its affiliates and their respective past, present and future directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, " _Releasees_ ") fully, finally and forever, from all and any manner of claims, actions, rights, causes of actions, suits, obligations, liabilities, debts, due sums of money, agreements, promises, damages, judgments, executions, accounts, expenses, costs, attorneys' fees and demands whatsoever, whether in law, contract or equity, whether known or unknown, matured or unmatured, foreseen or unforeseen, arising out of events existing or occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the Effective Time, in each case, in Pre-Closing Holder's capacity as a stockholder of the Company (or its predecessors) (including whether or not the Merger Consideration Schedule did not accurately reflect the terms of the Company Certificate) or otherwise relating to Pre-Closing Holder's acquisition, ownership, control or sale of Company Common Stock (including any rights to indemnities from the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any Contract entered into by such Pre-Closing Holder in connection with such issuance); provided, that nothing contained herein shall operate to release any liabilities of a Releasee based upon, arising out of or relating to, without duplication, (i) this Letter of Transmittal and each of the Exhibits hereto, including the Registration Rights Agreement and Stockholder Support Agreement, and any other document required by this Letter of Transmittal, the Merger Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements, (ii) the obligations of any insurer under any insurance policy (including any insurance policy obtained pursuant to Section 5.24 of the Merger Agreement), (iii) any rights to indemnification to the extent provided for (A) in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or (B) pursuant to Indemnification Agreement by and between the Pre-Closing Holder and the Company entered into prior to the date hereof, or (iv) any claims, actions, or causes of action that, as a matter of applicable Law, are not waivable. This release may not be altered except in a writing signed by the person or entity against whose interest such change shall operate.

  



  

   

J-8

 



    



  

6. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Letter of Transmittal or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Letter of Transmittal shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to the other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of Parent and the Pre-Closing Holder. The Pre-Closing Holder further agrees to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Letter of Transmittal with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

7. _Governing Law_. This Letter of Transmittal shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction would be required thereby).

  



  

8. _Survival_. No authority conferred herein or agreed to be conferred will be affected by, and all such authority will survive, the death or incapacity of the Pre-Closing Holder after the execution and delivery of this Letter of Transmittal. All obligations of the Pre-Closing Holder hereunder will be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors, assigns, trustees and other legal representatives of the Pre-Closing Holder.

  



  

9. _Miscellaneous_. The Pre-Closing Holder has read and understands this Letter of Transmittal and its legal consequences and has had adequate opportunity to receive independent legal, tax and/or financial advice with respect to the advisability of executing this Letter of Transmittal. The Pre-Closing Holder voluntarily accepts the terms of this Letter of Transmittal.

 _EXHIBIT K 
 FORM OF Director Nomination Agreement_

  



  

[See attached.]

  



  

   



 



    



  

DIRECTOR NOMINATION AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS DIRECTOR NOMINATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of [●] (the " _Effective Time_ "), by and among [Electric Last Mile
Solutions, Inc.], a Delaware corporation (f/k/a Forum Merger III Corporation)
(the " _Company_ "), and Forum Investors III LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Sponsor_ "). Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined in this Agreement have the respective meanings given to them
in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company and certain of its affiliates have consummated the
merger and other transactions (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ")
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 10,
2020, by and among the Company, ELMS Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation,
Electric Last Mile, Inc., a Delaware corporation and Jason Luo, in the
capacity as the initial Stockholder Representative thereto;

  



  

WHEREAS, in its capacity as the sponsor of the special purpose acquisition
company that was the predecessor to the Company, the Sponsor desires that,
after giving effect to the Transactions, it will continue to have
representation on the Board so as to continue to create value for its direct
and indirect equityholders (collectively with the Sponsor, the " _Forum
Parties_ ") and for the other direct and indirect equityholders of the
Company; and

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, the Sponsor desires to have certain
director nomination rights with respect to the Company, and the Company
desires to provide the Sponsor, on behalf of the Forum Parties, with such
rights, in each case, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficient of which
are hereby acknowledged, each of the parties to this Agreement agrees as
follows:

  



  

Article 1 
  
 NOMINATION RIGHT

  



  

Section 1.01. _Board Nomination Right_.

  



  

(a) From the Effective Time until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 2.01_ , at every meeting of the board of directors
of the Company (the " _Board_ "), or a committee thereof, or action by written
consent, at or by which directors of the Company are appointed by the Board
or are nominated to stand for election and elected by the stockholders of the
Company, the Sponsor shall have the right to appoint or nominate for election
to the Board, as applicable, two (2) individuals, to serve as directors of
the Company (any individual appointed or nominated by the Sponsor for election
to the Board pursuant to this _Section 1.01(a)_ , a " _Nominee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Nominees_ "). At the Effective Time, unless otherwise
designated by the Sponsor, the Nominees shall be David Boris and such other
Nominee as shall have been designated by the Sponsor in writing.

  



    

K-1

 



    



  

(b) The Company shall take all necessary actions within its control,
including, but not limited to, calling a meeting of the Board or executing an
action by unanimous written consent of the Board, such that, as of the
Effective Time, the Nominees shall either be elected by the Company's
stockholders at the meeting held to approve the Transactions or appointed to
the Board as of the Effective Time, in each case, as Class I directors (as
defined in the Company's Organizational Documents, each a " _Class I
Director_ ") with terms ending at the Company's 2022 annual meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary (including, without limitation, calling special meetings of the
Board and the stockholders of the Company and recommending, supporting and
soliciting proxies) (" _Necessary Action_ ") to ensure that: (i) the
applicable Nominees are included in the Board's slate of nominees to the
stockholders of the Company for each election of Class I Directors and
recommended by the Board at any meeting of stockholders called for the purpose
of electing Class I Directors; and (ii) each applicable Nominee up for
election is included in the proxy statement prepared by management of the
Company in connection with the Company's solicitation of proxies or consents
in favor of the foregoing for every meeting of the stockholders of the
Company called with respect to the election of Class I Directors, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the stockholders of the Company or the Board with respect
to the election of Class I Directors.

  



  

(d) If any Nominee ceases to serve for any reason, the Sponsor shall, subject
to the Sponsor then being entitled to nominate an individual for election or
appointment as a director pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)_ , be entitled to
designate for election or appointment as a director such person's successor
in accordance with this Agreement and the Company shall take all Necessary
Action to cause any such vacancy to be filled by such replacement director
designated by the Sponsor as promptly as practicable after such designation
(and in any event prior to the next meeting or action of the Board).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any of this _Section 1.01_ to the contrary, the election
or appointment of any Nominee to the Board shall be subject to the prior
execution by such Nominee of an irrevocable resignation letter in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

  



  

(f) The Company shall indemnify the Nominees who are appointed or elected as
Class I Directors on the same basis as all other members of the Board and
pursuant to indemnity agreements with terms that are no less favorable to such
Nominees than the indemnity agreements entered into between the Company and
its other non-employee directors.

  



  

(g) Nominees who are appointed or elected as Class I Directors shall be
entitled to compensation (including equity awards) that is consistent with
the compensation received by other non-employee directors of the Company. In
addition, the Company shall pay the reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by each such Nominee in connection with his or her services
provided to or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
attending Board and committee meetings or events attended on behalf of the
Company or at the Company's request.

  



    

K-2

 



    



  

(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 1.01_ , the Sponsor shall
not be entitled to designate a Person as a nominee to the Board upon a
written determination by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of
the Company (which determination shall set forth in writing reasonable
grounds for the determination) that the Person would not be qualified under
any applicable law, rule or regulation to serve as a director of the Company.
In such an event, the Sponsor shall be entitled to select a Person as a
replacement Nominee and the Company shall use its best efforts to cause that
Person to be nominated as a Nominee at the same meeting (or, if
permitted, pursuant to the same action by written consent of the
stockholders) as the initial Person was to be nominated.

  



  

Article 2 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the

jurisdiction to enforce any of the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of

matter of this Agreement. Each party acknowledges and agrees that, in entering
into this Agreement, such party has not relied on any promises or assurances,
written or oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to

would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 2.08. _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the

objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be

judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 2.08_. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.

  



  

Section 2.09. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching

agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right to enforce its
rights and the other party's obligations hereunder by an action or actions for
specific performance and/or injunctive relief (without posting of bond or
other security), including any order, injunction or decree sought by such
non-breaching party to cause the other party to perform its/their respective
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and to cure breaches of
this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual harm and/or damages or
posting a bond or other security therefore. Each party further agrees that
the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for
any such equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

under what circumstances Awards may be settled or exercised in cash, Common
Stock, other securities, other Awards or other property, or canceled,
forfeited, or suspended and the method or methods by which Awards may be
settled, exercised, canceled, forfeited, or suspended; (vi) determine whether,
to what extent, and under what circumstances the delivery of cash, Common
Stock, other securities, other Awards or other property and other amounts
payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred either automatically or at
the election of the Participant or of the Committee; (vii)
interpret, administer, reconcile any inconsistency in, correct any defect in
and/or supply any omission in the Plan and any instrument or agreement
relating to, or Award granted under, the Plan, including any changes required
to comply with Applicable Laws; (viii) establish, amend, suspend, or waive
any rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Committee shall deem
appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan; (ix) accelerate the
vesting or exercisability of, payment for or lapse of restrictions on,
Awards; (x) modify any Performance Goals, criteria and/or periods; and (y)
make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee
deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan, in each case,
to the extent consistent with the terms of the Plan.

(c) The Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company or any
Affiliate the authority to act on behalf of the Committee with respect to any
matter, right, obligation, or election that is the responsibility of or that
is allocated to the Committee herein, and that may be so delegated as a
matter of law, except for grants of Awards to persons subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act.

  



  

(d) Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, all designations,
determinations, interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to
the Plan or any Award or any documents evidencing Awards granted pursuant to
the Plan shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made at
any time and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all persons or
entities, including, without limitation, the Company, any Affiliate, any
Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award, and any stockholder of
the Company.

  



  

(e) No member of the Board, the Committee, delegate of the Committee or any
employee or agent of the Company (each such person, an "
_Indemnifiable Person_ ") shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to
be taken or any determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or
any Award hereunder. Each Indemnifiable Person shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or
expense (including attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by
such Indemnifiable Person in connection with or resulting from any action,
suit or proceeding to which such Indemnifiable Person may be a party or in
which such Indemnifiable Person may be involved by reason of any action taken
or omitted to be taken under the Plan or any Award Agreement and against and
from any and all amounts paid by such Indemnifiable Person with the Company's
approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such Indemnifiable Person in
satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against
such Indemnifiable Person, _provided_ that the Company shall have the right,
at its own expense, to assume and defend any such action, suit or proceeding
and once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume the defense, the
Company shall have sole control over such defense with counsel of the
Company's choice. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be
available to an Indemnifiable Person to the extent that a final judgment or
other final adjudication (in either case not subject to further appeal)
binding upon such Indemnifiable Person determines that the acts or omissions
of such Indemnifiable Person giving rise to the indemnification claim
resulted from such Indemnifiable Person's bad faith, fraud or willful criminal
act or omission or that such right of indemnification is otherwise prohibited
by law or by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. The
foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights
of indemnification to which such Indemnifiable Persons may be entitled under
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or
otherwise, or any other power that the Company may have to indemnify such
Indemnifiable Persons or hold them harmless.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the
Board may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time,
grant Awards and administer the Plan with respect to such Awards. In any such
case, the Board shall have all the authority granted to the Committee under
the Plan.

  



  

   

M-1-7

 



    



  

5\. _ _Grant of Awards ; Shares Subject to the Plan; Limitations__.

  



  

(a) The Committee may, from time to time, grant Awards to one or more
Eligible Persons.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, Awards granted under the Plan shall
be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Committee is authorized to
deliver under the Plan an aggregate of 29,200,000 shares of Common Stock;
provided, that the total number of shares of Common Stock that will be
reserved, and that may be issued, under the Plan will automatically increase
on the first trading day of each calendar year, beginning with calendar year
2021, by a number of shares of Common Stock equal to one percent (1%) of the
total outstanding shares of Common Stock on the last day of the prior calendar
year, and (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be
subject to an Award granted under the Plan during any single fiscal year to
any Participant who is a non-employee director, when taken together with any
cash fees paid to such non-employee director during such year in respect of
his service as a non-employee director (including service as a member or chair
of any committee of the Board), shall not exceed $500,000 in total value
(calculating the value of any such Award based on the Fair Market Value on the
Date of Grant of such Award for financial reporting purposes); _provided_
that the non-employee directors who are considered independent (under
the rules of NASDAQ or other securities exchange on which the Common Stock is
traded) may make exceptions to this limit for a non-executive chair of the
Board, if any, in which case the non-employee director receiving such
additional compensation may not participate in the decision to award such
compensation. Notwithstanding the automatic annual increase set forth in (i)
above, the Board may act prior to January 1st of a given year to provide that
there will be no such increase in the share reserve for such year or that the
increase in the share reserve for such year will be a lesser number of shares
of Common Stock than would otherwise occur pursuant to the stipulated
percentage.

  



  

(c) In the event that (i) any Option or other Award granted hereunder is
exercised through the tendering of Common Stock (either actually or by
attestation) or by the withholding of Common Stock by the Company, or (ii) tax
or deduction liabilities arising from such Option or other Award are
satisfied by the tendering of Common Stock (either actually or by attestation)
or by the withholding of Common Stock by the Company, then in each such case
the shares of Common Stock so tendered or withheld shall be added to
the shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Plan on a one-for-
one basis. Shares underlying Awards under this Plan that are forfeited,
canceled, expire unexercised, or are settled in cash shall also be available
again for issuance as Awards under the Plan.

  



  

(d) Common Stock delivered by the Company in settlement of Awards may be
authorized and unissued shares, shares held in the treasury of the Company,
shares purchased on the open market or by private purchase, or a combination
of the foregoing.

  



  

(e) Awards may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, be granted under
the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding
awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the Company or with which
the Company combines (" _Substitute Award_ s"). The number of shares of
Common Stock underlying any Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards under the
Plan.

  



  

6\. _ _Eligibility__. Participation shall be limited to Eligible Persons
who have entered into an Award Agreement or who have received written
notification from the Committee, or from a person designated by the
Committee, that they have been selected to participate in the Plan.

  



  

   

M-1-8

 



    



  

7\. _ _Options__.

  



  

(a) _ _Generally__. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced
by an Award Agreement (whether in paper or electronic medium (including
email or the posting on a web site maintained by the Company or a third party
under contract with the Company)). Each Option so granted shall be subject to
the conditions set forth in this Section 7 and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
Agreement. All Options granted under the Plan shall be Nonqualified Stock
Options unless the applicable Award Agreement expressly states that the
Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option. Subject to Section 12,
the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued
through the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan is
29,200,000 shares of Common Stock, and, for the avoidance of doubt, such share
limit shall not be subject to the annual adjustment provided in Section
5(b)(i). Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to Eligible Persons who
are employees of the Company and its Affiliates, and no Incentive Stock
Option shall be granted to any Eligible Person who is ineligible to
receive an Incentive Stock Option under the Code. No Option shall be treated
as an Incentive Stock Option unless the Plan has been approved by the
stockholders of the Company in a manner intended to comply with the
stockholder approval requirements of Section 422(b)(1) of the Code;
_provided_ that any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall not
fail to be effective solely on account of a failure to obtain such approval,
but rather such Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option
unless and until such approval is obtained. In the case of an Incentive Stock
Option, the terms and conditions of such grant shall be subject to and comply
with such rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. If for any
reason an Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option (or any portion
thereof) shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent
of such nonqualification, such Option or portion thereof shall be regarded as
a Nonqualified Stock Option appropriately granted under the Plan.

  



  

(b) _ _Exercise Price__. Except with respect to Substitute Awards, the
exercise price (" _Exercise Price_ ") per share of Common Stock for each
Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such share
determined as of the Date of Grant (unless such Option is a Nonqualified
Stock Option and complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code);
_provided_ ,  _howeve_ r, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option
granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Option, owns
shares representing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of shares of the Company or any related corporation (as determined in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.422-2(f)), the Exercise Price
per share shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per share on
the Date of Grant and _provided furthe_ r, that, notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, the Exercise Price shall not be less than
the par value per share of Common Stock.

  



  

(c) _ _Vesting and Expiration__. Options shall vest and become exercisable
in such manner and on such date or dates determined by the
Committee (including, if applicable, the attainment of any Performance Goals,
as determined by the Committee in the applicable Award Agreement) and shall
expire after such period, not to exceed ten years, as may be determined by the
Committee (the " _Option Period_ ");  _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that the
Option Period shall not exceed five years from the Date of Grant in the case
of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who on the Date of
Grant owns shares representing more than 10% of the total combined
voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any related
corporation (as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.422-2(f)); _provided_ , _furthe_ r, that notwithstanding any vesting dates
set by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate
the exercisability of any Option, which acceleration shall not affect the
terms and conditions of such Option other than with respect to
exercisability. In the event of any termination of employment or service with
the Company or its Affiliates thereof of a Participant who has been granted
one or more Options, the Options shall be exercisable at the time or times
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. If
the Option would expire at a time when the exercise of the Option would
violate applicable securities laws, the expiration date applicable to the
Option will be automatically extended to a date that is 30 calendar days
following the date such exercise would no longer violate applicable
securities laws (so long as such extension shall not violate Section 409A of
the Code); __provided__ , that in no event shall such expiration date be
extended beyond the expiration of the Option Period.

  



  

   

M-1-9

 



    



  

(d) _ _Method of Exercise and Form of Paymen_ t_. No Common Stock shall be
delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the
Exercise Price therefor is received by the Company and the Participant has
paid to the Company an amount equal to any taxes required to be withheld or
paid upon exercise of such Option. Options that have become exercisable may be
exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company in accordance with the terms of the Option, accompanied by payment of
the Exercise Price. The Exercise Price shall be payable (i) in cash, check,
cash equivalent and/or Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value at the
time the Option is exercised (including, pursuant to procedures approved by
the Committee, by means of attestation of ownership of a sufficient number of
Common Stock in lieu of actual delivery of such shares to the Company);  _
_provided__ , that, such Common Stock are not subject to any pledge or other
security interest and are Mature Shares; and (ii) by such other method as the
Committee may permit in accordance with Applicable Law, in its sole
discretion, including without limitation: (A) in other property having a Fair
Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price, (B)
if there is a public market for the Common Stock at such time, by means of a
broker-assisted "cashless exercise" pursuant to which the Company is
delivered a copy of irrevocable instructions to a stockbroker to sell the
Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option and to
deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the Exercise Price, or (C)
by a "net exercise" method whereby the Company withholds from the delivery of
the shares of Common Stock for which the Option was exercised that number of
shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate
Exercise Price for the shares of Common Stock for which the Option was
exercised. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered
pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether
cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu
of any fractional share of Common Stock, or whether such fractional share of
Common Stock or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise
eliminated.

  



  

(e) _ _Notification upon Disqualifying Disposition of an Incentive Stock
Option__. Each Participant awarded an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan
shall notify the Company in writing immediately after the date he makes a
disqualifying disposition of any Common Stock acquired pursuant to the
exercise of such Incentive Stock Option. A disqualifying disposition is any
disposition (including, without limitation, any sale) of such Common Stock
before the later of (i) two years after the Date of Grant of the Incentive
Stock Option or (ii) one year after the date of exercise of the Incentive
Stock Option. The Company may, if determined by the Committee and
in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, retain possession
of any Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock
Option as agent for the applicable Participant until the end of the period
described in the preceding sentence.

  



  

(f) _ _Compliance With Laws, etc__. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall a Participant be permitted to exercise an Option in a manner that
the Committee determines would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, if
applicable; any other Applicable Law; the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission; or the applicable rules and
regulations of any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on
which the securities of the Company are listed or traded.

  



  

8\. _ _Stock Appreciation Rights__.

  



  

(a) _ _Generally__. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by
an Award Agreement (whether in paper or electronic medium (including email or
the posting on a web site maintained by the Company or a third party under
contract with the Company)). Each SAR so granted shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Section 8 and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
Agreement. Any Option granted under the Plan may include tandem SARs. The
Committee also may award SARs to Eligible Persons independent of any Option.

  



  

(b) _ _Strike Price__. The Strike Price per share of Common Stock for each
SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such share
determined as of the Date of Grant.

  



  

   

M-1-10

 



    



  

(c) _ _Vesting and Expiration__. A SAR granted in connection with an Option
shall become exercisable and shall expire according to the same vesting
schedule and expiration provisions as the corresponding Option. A SAR granted
independent of an Option shall vest and become exercisable and shall expire
in such manner and on such date or dates determined by the Committee
(including, if applicable, the attainment of any Performance Goals, as shall
be determined by the Committee in the applicable Award Agreement) and shall
expire after such period, not to exceed ten years, as may be determined by
the Committee (the " _SAR Period_ "); __provided__ ,  _ _howeve_ r_, that
notwithstanding any vesting dates set by the Committee, the Committee may, in
its sole discretion, accelerate the exercisability of any SAR, which
acceleration shall not affect the terms and conditions of such SAR other than
with respect to exercisability. In the event of any termination of employment
or service with the Company and its Affiliates thereof of a Participant who
has been granted one or more SARs, the SARs shall be exercisable at the time
or times and subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the Award
Agreement (or in the underlying Option Award Agreement, as may be applicable).
If the SAR would expire at a time when the exercise of the SAR would violate
applicable securities laws, the expiration date applicable to the SAR will be
automatically extended to a date that is 30 calendar days following the date
such exercise would no longer violate applicable securities laws (so long as
such extension shall not violate Section 409A of the Code); __provided__
, that, in no event shall such expiration date be extended beyond the
expiration of the SAR Period.

  



  

(d) _ _Method of Exercise__. SARs that have become exercisable may be
exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company in accordance with the terms of the Award, specifying the number of
SARs to be exercised and the date on which such SARs were awarded.

  



  

(e) _ _Paymen_ t_. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall pay to the
Participant an amount equal to the number of shares subject to the SAR that
are being exercised, multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock on the exercise date over the Strike
Price, less an amount equal to any taxes required to be withheld or paid. The
Company shall pay such amount in cash, in Common Stock having a Fair Market
Value equal to such amount, or any combination thereof, as determined by the
Committee. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered
pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether
cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu
of any fractional share of Common Stock, or whether such fractional share of
Common Stock or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise
eliminated.

  



  

9\. _ _Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units__.

  



  

(a) _ _Generally__. Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock
Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement (whether in paper or
electronic medium (including email or the posting on a web site maintained by
the Company or a third party under contract with the Company)). Each such
grant shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 9 and to
such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in
the applicable Award Agreement (including the Performance Goals, if any, upon
whose attainment the Restricted Period shall lapse in part or full).

  



  

(b) _ _Restricted Accounts ; Escrow or Similar Arrangemen_t_. Upon the
grant of Restricted Stock, a book entry in a restricted account shall be
established in the Participant's name at the Company's transfer agent and, if
the Committee determines that the Restricted Stock shall be held by the
Company or in escrow rather than held in such restricted account pending the
release of the applicable restrictions, the Committee may require the
Participant to additionally execute and deliver to the Company (i) an escrow
agreement satisfactory to the Committee, if applicable, and (ii) the
appropriate stock power (endorsed in blank) with respect to the Restricted
Stock covered by such agreement. If a Participant shall fail to execute an
agreement evidencing an Award of Restricted Stock and, if applicable, an
escrow agreement and blank stock power within the amount of time specified by
the Committee, the Award shall be null and void. Subject to the restrictions
set forth in this Section 9 and the applicable Award Agreement, the
Participant generally shall have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as
to such Restricted Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote
such Restricted Stock and the right to receive dividends, if applicable,
provided that such dividends may be made subject to vesting or other
conditions or may be required to be reinvested into additional shares of
Restricted Stock, as determined by the Committee in its discretion. To the
extent shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited, any share
certificates issued to the Participant evidencing such shares shall be
returned to the Company, and all rights of the Participant to such shares and
as a stockholder with respect thereto shall terminate without further
obligation on the part of the Company.

  



  

   

M-1-11

 



    



  

(c) _ _Vesting__. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award
Agreement, the unvested portion of Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Units shall terminate and be forfeited upon termination of employment
or service of the Participant granted the applicable Award.

  



  

(d) _ _Delivery of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted Stock
Unit_ s_.

  



  

(i) Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any shares
of Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect with respect to such shares,
except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. If an escrow
arrangement is used, upon such expiration, the Company shall deliver to the
Participant, or his beneficiary, without charge, the share certificate
evidencing the shares of Restricted Stock that have not then been forfeited
and with respect to which the Restricted Period has expired (rounded down to
the nearest full share) or shall register such shares in the
Participant's name without any such restrictions. Dividends, if any, that may
have been withheld by the Committee and attributable to any particular share
of Restricted Stock shall be distributed to the Participant in cash or, at the
sole discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair
Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, upon the release of
restrictions on such share and, if such share is forfeited, the Participant
shall have no right to such dividends (except as otherwise set forth by the
Committee in the applicable Award Agreement).

  



  

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, and
subject to any applicable deferral election authorized by the Committee, upon
the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any outstanding
Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, or his
beneficiary, without charge, one share of Common Stock for each such
outstanding Restricted Stock Unit;  _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to (A) pay cash or part cash and
part shares of Common Stock in lieu of delivering only Common Stock in
respect of such Restricted Stock Units or (B) defer the delivery of Common
Stock (or cash or part Common Stock and part cash, as the case may be) beyond
the expiration of the Restricted Period if such delivery would result in a
violation of Applicable Law until such time as is no longer the case. If a
cash payment is made in lieu of delivering Common Stock, the amount of such
payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the
date on which the Restricted Period lapsed with respect to such Restricted
Stock Units, less an amount equal to any taxes required to be withheld or
paid.

  



  

10\. _ _Other Stock-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards__..

  



  

(a) _ _Other Stock-Based Awards_._ The Committee may grant types of equity-
based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms of the
Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted Common Stock), in
such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Committee shall
determine (including, if applicable, the attainment of any Performance Goals,
as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement). Such Other Stock-Based
Awards may involve the transfer of actual Common Stock to Participants, or
payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Common Stock.
The terms and conditions of such Awards shall be consistent with the Plan and
set forth in the Award Agreement and need not be uniform among all such Awards
or all Participants receiving such Awards.

  



  

   

M-1-12

 



    



  

(b) _ _Other Cash-Based Awards__. The Committee may grant a Participant a
cash Award not otherwise described by the terms of the Plan, including cash
awarded as a bonus or upon the attainment of Performance Goals or otherwise as
permitted under the Plan.

  



  

(c) _ _Value of Awards__. Each Other Stock-Based Award shall be expressed
in terms of shares of Common Stock or units based on Common Stock, as
determined by the Committee, and each Other Cash-Based Award shall be
expressed in terms of cash. The Committee may establish Performance Goals in
its discretion and any such Performance Goals shall be set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement. If the Committee exercises its discretion to
establish Performance Goals, the number and/or value of Other Stock-Based
Awards or Other Cash-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant
will depend on the extent to which such Performance Goals are met.

  



  

(d) _ _Payment of Awards__. Payment, if any, with respect to an Other
Stock-Based Award or Other Cash-Based Award shall be made in accordance with
the terms of the Award, as set forth in the Award Agreement, in cash, Common
Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock, as the Committee determines.

  



  

(e) _ _Vesting__. The Committee shall determine the extent to which the
Participant shall have the right to receive Other Stock-Based Awards or
Other Cash-Based Awards following the Participant's termination of employment
or service (including by reason of such Participant's death, disability (as
determined by the Committee), or termination without Cause). Such provisions
shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and will be
included in the applicable Award Agreement but need not be uniform among all
Other Stock-Based Awards or Other Cash-Based Awards issued pursuant to the
Plan and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for the termination of
employment or service.

  



  

11\. _ _Dividend Equivalents__. Subject to Section 12, no adjustment shall
be made in the Common Stock issuable or taken into account under Awards on
account of cash dividends that may be paid or other rights that may be issued
to the holders of Common Stock prior to issuance of such Common Stock under
such Award. The Committee may grant Dividend Equivalents based on the
dividends declared on shares of Common Stock that are subject to any Award
(other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right). Any Award of
Dividend Equivalents may be credited as of the dividend payment dates, during
the period between the Date of Grant of the Award and the date the Award
becomes payable or terminates or expires, as determined by the Committee;
however, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Dividend Equivalents
shall not be payable unless and until the Award becomes payable, and shall be
subject to forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying Award. Dividend
Equivalents may be subject to any additional limitations and/or
restrictions determined by the Committee. Dividend Equivalents shall be
payable in cash or Common Stock or converted to full-value Awards,
calculated based on such formula as may be determined by the Committee.

  

 _ _

  

12\. _ _Changes in Capital Structure and Similar Events__. In the event of
(a) any dividend (other than ordinary cash dividends) or other distribution
(whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities or other
property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
reorganization, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, spin-off, split-up,
split-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Common Stock or other
securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to acquire
Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate
transaction or event (including, without limitation, a Change in
Control) that affects the Common Stock, or (b) unusual or infrequently
occurring events (including, without limitation, a Change in
Control) affecting the Company, any Affiliate, or the financial statements of
the Company or any Affiliate, or changes in applicable rules, rulings,
regulations or other requirements of any governmental body or securities
exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, accounting principles or law, such
that in either case an adjustment is determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion to be necessary or appropriate, then the Committee shall make any
such adjustments in such manner as it may deem equitable, subject to the
requirements of Sections 409A, 421, and 422 of the Code, if applicable,
including without limitation any or all of the following:

  



  

(a) adjusting any or all of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or
other property) that may be delivered in respect of Awards or with respect to
which Awards may be granted under the Plan (including, without limitation,
adjusting any or all of the limitations under Section 5 of the Plan) and (ii)
the terms of any outstanding Award, including, without limitation, (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number
and kind of other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards
or to which outstanding Awards relate, (B) the Exercise Price or Strike Price
with respect to any Award or (C) any applicable performance measures;

  



  

   

M-1-13

 



    



  

(b) providing for a substitution or assumption of Awards in a manner that
substantially preserves the applicable terms of such Awards;

  



  

(c) accelerating the exercisability or vesting of, lapse of restrictions on,
or termination of, Awards or providing for a period of time for
exercise prior to the occurrence of such event;

  



  

(d) modifying the terms of Awards to add events, conditions or circumstances
(including termination of employment within a specified period after a Change
in Control) upon which the exercisability or vesting of or lapse of
restrictions thereon will accelerate;

  



  

(e) deeming any performance measures satisfied at target, maximum or actual
performance through closing or such other level determined by the Committee
in its sole discretion, or providing for the performance measures to continue
(as is or as adjusted by the Committee) after closing;

  



  

(f) providing that for a period prior to the Change in Control determined by
the Committee in its sole discretion, any Options or SARs that would not
otherwise become exercisable prior to the Change in Control will be
exercisable as to all Common Stock subject thereto (but any such exercise
will be contingent upon and subject to the occurrence of the Change in Control
and if the Change in Control does not take place after giving such notice for
any reason whatsoever, the exercise will be null and void) and that any
Options or SARs not exercised prior to the consummation of the Change in
Control will terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the
consummation of the Change in Control; and

  



  

(g) canceling any one or more outstanding Awards and causing to be paid to
the holders thereof, in cash, Common Stock, other securities or
other property, or any combination thereof, the value of such Awards, if any,
as determined by the Committee (which if applicable may be based upon the
price per share of Common Stock received or to be received by other
stockholders of the Company in such event), including without limitation, in
the case of an outstanding Option or SAR, a cash payment in an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value (as of a date specified by the
Committee) of the Common Stock subject to such Option or SAR over the
aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price of such Option or SAR, respectively
(it being understood that, in such event, any Option or SAR having a per
share Exercise Price or Strike Price equal to, or in excess of, the Fair
Market Value of a share of Common Stock subject thereto may be canceled and
terminated without any payment or consideration therefor); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the case of any "equity restructuring" (within the meaning
of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 718), the Committee shall make an equitable or proportionate adjustment
to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity restructuring. The Company shall
give each Participant notice of an adjustment hereunder and, upon notice,
such adjustment shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

13\. _ _Amendments and Termination__.

  



  

(a) _ _Amendment and Termination of the Plan__. The Board may amend, alter,
suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any
time; _provided_ that (i) no amendment to Section 13(b) (to the extent
required by the proviso in such Section 13(b)) shall be made without
stockholder approval and (ii) no such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuation or termination shall be made without stockholder approval if
such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement
applicable to the Plan (including, without limitation, as necessary to comply
with any rules or requirements of any securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Common Stock may be listed or quoted);
_provided_ , _furthe_ r, that any such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance or termination that would materially and adversely affect the
rights of any Participant or any holder or beneficiary of any Award
theretofore granted shall not to that extent be effective without the consent
of the affected Participant, holder or beneficiary.

  



  

(b) _ _Amendment of Award Agreement_ s_. The Committee may, to the extent
consistent with the terms of any applicable Award Agreement, waive any
conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter, suspend,
discontinue, cancel or terminate, any Award theretofore granted or the
associated Award Agreement, prospectively or retroactively; _provided_ that
any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance,
cancellation or termination that would materially and adversely affect the
rights of any Participant with respect to any Award theretofore granted shall
not to that extent be effective without the consent of the
affected Participant, unless the Committee determines, in its sole
discretion, that the amendment is necessary for the Award to comply
with Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that without
stockholder approval, except as otherwise permitted under Section 12 of the
Plan, (i) no amendment or modification may reduce the Exercise Price of any
Option or the Strike Price of any SAR, (ii) the Committee may not cancel any
outstanding Option or SAR where the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
underlying such Option or SAR is less than its Exercise Price and replace it
with a new Option or SAR, another Award or cash and (iii) the Committee may
not take any other action that is considered a "repricing" for purposes of the
stockholder approval rules of the applicable securities exchange or inter-
dealer quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted.

  



  

14\. _ _Genera_ l_.

  



  

(a) _ _Award Agreements__. Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by
an Award Agreement, which shall be delivered to the Participant (whether in
paper or electronic medium (including email or the posting on a web site
maintained by the Company or a third party under contract with the Company))
and shall specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules
applicable thereto, including, without limitation, the effect on such Award
of the death, disability or termination of employment or service of a
Participant, or of such other events as may be determined by the Committee.
Except as the Plan otherwise provides, each Award may be made alone or in
addition or in relation to any other Award. The terms of each Award to a
Participant need not be identical, and the Committee need not treat
Participants or Awards (or portions thereof) uniformly.

  



  

(b) _ _Nontransferability__.

  



  

(i) Each Award shall be exercisable only by a Participant during the
Participant's lifetime, or, if permissible under Applicable Law, by the
Participant's legal guardian or representative. No Award may be assigned,
alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by
a Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution
and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale,
transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company
or an Affiliate; _provided_ that the designation of a beneficiary shall not
constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or
encumbrance.

  



  

   

M-1-15

 



    



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, permit Awards (other than Incentive Stock Options) to be
transferred by a Participant, without consideration, subject to such rules as
the Committee may adopt consistent with any applicable Award Agreement to
preserve the purposes of the Plan, to: (A) any person who is a "family member"
of the Participant, as such term is used in the instructions to Form S-8
under the Securities Act (collectively, the " _Immediate Family Members_
"); (B) a trust solely for the benefit of the Participant and his Immediate
Family Members; (C) a partnership or limited liability company whose only
partners or stockholders are the Participant and his Immediate Family Members;
or (D) any other transferee as may be approved either (I) by the Board or the
Committee in its sole discretion, or (II) as provided in the applicable
Award Agreement (each transferee described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D)
above is hereinafter referred to as, a " _Permitted Transferee_ ");
_provided_ that the Participant gives the Committee advance written notice
describing the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer and the
Committee notifies the Participant in writing that such a transfer would
comply with the requirements of the Plan.

  



  

(iii) The terms of any Award transferred in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence shall apply to the Permitted Transferee and any reference
in the Plan, or in any applicable Award Agreement, to a Participant shall be
deemed to refer to the Permitted Transferee, except that (A) Permitted
Transferees shall not be entitled to transfer any Award, other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution; (B) Permitted Transferees shall not be
entitled to exercise any transferred Option unless there shall be in effect a
registration statement on an appropriate form covering the Common Stock to be
acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option if the Committee determines,
consistent with any applicable Award Agreement, that such a registration
statement is necessary or appropriate; (C) the Committee or the Company shall
not be required to provide any notice to a Permitted Transferee, whether or
not such notice is or would otherwise have been required to be given to the
Participant under the Plan or otherwise; and (D) the consequences of the
termination of the Participant's employment by, or services to, the Company or
an Affiliate under the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement
shall continue to be applied with respect to the Participant,
including, without limitation, that an Option shall be exercisable by the
Permitted Transferee only to the extent, and for the periods, specified in
the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

(c) _ _Tax Withholding and Deductions__.

  



  

(i) A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or any Affiliate,
and the Company or any Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby
authorized to deduct and withhold, from any cash, Common Stock, other
securities or other property deliverable under any Award or from any
compensation or other amounts owing to a Participant, the amount (in cash,
Common Stock, other securities or other property) of any required taxes (up
to the maximum statutory rate under Applicable Law as in effect from time to
time as determined by the Committee) and deduction in respect of an Award,
its grant, vesting or exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or
under the Plan and to take such other action as may be necessary in the
opinion of the Committee or the Company to satisfy all obligations for the
payment of such taxes.

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the generality of clause (i) above, the Committee may,
in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part,
the foregoing tax and deduction liability by (A) the delivery of shares of
Common Stock (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest
and are Mature Shares, except as otherwise determined by the Committee) owned
by the Participant having a Fair Market Value equal to such liability or (B)
having the Company withhold from the number of shares of Common
Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable pursuant to the exercise or
settlement of the Award a number of shares with a Fair Market Value equal to
such liability.

  



  

   

M-1-16

 



    



  

(d) _ _No Claim to Awards ; No Rights to Continued Employment; Waiver__. No
employee of the Company or an Affiliate, or other person, shall have any
Claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan or, having been selected
for the grant of an Award, to be selected for a grant of any other Award. A
Participant's sole remedy for any Claim related to the Plan or any
Award shall be against the Company, and no Participant shall have any Claim
or right of any nature against any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company or
any stockholder or existing or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. There is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee's determinations and
interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect
to each Participant and may be made selectively among Participants, whether
or not such Participants are similarly situated. Neither the Plan nor any
action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant any right
to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or an Affiliate, nor
shall it be construed as giving any Participant any rights to continued
service on the Board. The Company or any of its Affiliates may at any time
dismiss a Participant from employment or discontinue any
consulting relationship, free from any liability or any Claim under the Plan,
unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or any Award Agreement. By
accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant shall thereby be deemed to
have waived any Claim to continued exercise or vesting of an Award or to
damages or severance entitlement related to non-continuation of the Award
beyond the period provided under the Plan or any Award Agreement,
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any written employment
contract or other agreement between the Company and its Affiliates and the
Participant, whether any such agreement is executed before, on or after the
Date of Grant.

  



  

(e) _ _International Participant_ s_. With respect to Participants who
reside or work outside of the United States of America, the Committee may in
its sole discretion amend the terms of the Plan or outstanding Awards with
respect to such Participants in order to conform such terms with the
requirements of local law or to obtain more favorable tax or other treatment
for a Participant, the Company or its Affiliates.

  



  

(f) _ _Designation and Change of Beneficiary__. To the extent permitted by
the Committee, each Participant may file with the Committee a
written designation of one or more persons as the beneficiary(ies) who shall
be entitled to receive the amounts payable with respect to an Award, if any,
due under the Plan upon his death. A Participant may, from time to time,
revoke or change his beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior
beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Committee. The last such
designation received by the Committee shall be controlling; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be
effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participant's death,
and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. If
no beneficiary designation is filed by a Participant, or if the Committee does
not permit beneficiary designations, then the beneficiary shall be deemed to
be the Participant's spouse or, if the Participant is unmarried at the time
of death, his estate.

  



  

(g) _ _Termination of Employment/Service__. Unless determined otherwise by
the Committee at any time following such event: (i) neither a
temporary absence from employment or service due to illness, vacation or
leave of absence nor a transfer from employment or service with the Company
to employment or service with an Affiliate (or vice-versa) shall be considered
a termination of employment or service with the Company or an Affiliate; and
(ii) if a Participant's employment with the Company and its Affiliates
terminates, but such Participant continues to provide services to the Company
and its Affiliates in a non-employee capacity (or vice-versa), such change in
status shall not be considered a termination of employment with the Company or
an Affiliate.

  



  

(h) _ _No Rights as a Stockholder__. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in the Plan or any Award Agreement, no person shall be entitled to
the privileges of ownership in respect of Common Stock or other securities
that are subject to Awards hereunder until such shares have been issued or
delivered to that person.

  



  

   

M-1-17

 



    



  

(i) _ _Government and Other Regulations__.

  



  

(i) The obligation of the Company to settle Awards in Common Stock or other
consideration shall be subject to all Applicable Laws, rules, and
regulations, and to such approvals by governmental agencies as may be
required. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the
contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to
sell, and shall be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any Common
Stock or other securities pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been
properly registered for sale pursuant to the Securities Act with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or unless the Company has received an
opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the Company, that such shares may be
offered or sold without such registration pursuant to an available exemption
therefrom and the terms and conditions of such exemption have been fully
complied with. The Company shall be under no obligation to register for sale
under the Securities Act any of the Common Stock or other securities to be
offered or sold under the Plan. The Committee shall have the authority to
provide that all certificates for Common Stock or other securities of the
Company or any Affiliate delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such
stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem
advisable under the Plan, the applicable Award Agreement, the federal
securities laws, or the rules, regulations and other requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, any securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system upon which such shares or other securities are then listed
or quoted and any other applicable federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws,
and, without limiting the generality of Section 9 of the Plan, the Committee
may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make
appropriate reference to such restrictions. Notwithstanding any provision in
the Plan to the contrary, the Committee reserves the right to add any
additional terms or provisions to any Award granted under the Plan that it in
its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable in order that such Award
complies with the legal requirements of any governmental entity to whose
jurisdiction the Award is subject.

  



  

(ii) The Committee may cancel an Award or any portion thereof if the
Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that legal or
contractual restrictions and/or blockage and/or other market considerations
would make the Company's acquisition of Common Stock from the public markets,
the Company's issuance of Common Stock or other securities to the Participant,
the Participant's acquisition of Common Stock or other securities from the
Company and/or the Participant's sale of Common Stock to the public markets,
illegal, impracticable or inadvisable. If the Committee determines to cancel
all or any portion of an Award denominated in Common Stock in accordance with
the foregoing, the Company shall pay to the Participant an amount equal to the
excess of  (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to
such Award or portion thereof that is canceled (determined as of the
applicable exercise date, or the date that the shares would have been vested
or delivered, as applicable), over (B) the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike
Price (in the case of an Option or SAR, respectively) or any amount payable as
a condition of delivery of Common Stock (in the case of any other Award).
Such amount shall be delivered to the Participant as soon as
practicable following the cancellation of such Award or portion thereof.

  



  

(j) _ _Payments to Persons Other Than Participants__. If the Committee
shall find that any person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan is
unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, or is a
minor, or has died, then any payment due to such person or his estate (unless
a prior Claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative)
may, if the Committee so directs the Company, be paid to his or her spouse,
child, relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of such person,
or any other person deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf
of such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a
complete discharge of the liability of the Committee and the Company therefor.

  



  

   

M-1-18

 



    



  

(k) _ _Nonexclusivity of the Plan__. Neither the adoption of this Plan by
the Board nor the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company
for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of
the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem
desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options or
other equity-based awards otherwise than under this Plan, and such
arrangements may be either applicable generally or only in specific cases.

  



  

(l) _ _No Trust or Fund Created__. The Plan is intended to constitute an
"unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. Neither the Plan nor any Award
shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or
a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate, on the one
hand, and a Participant or other person or entity, on the other hand. No
provision of the Plan or any Award shall require the Company, for the purpose
of satisfying any obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any
assets in a trust or other entity to which contributions are made or otherwise
to segregate any assets, nor shall the Company maintain separate bank
accounts, books, records or other evidence of the existence of a segregated or
separately maintained or administered fund for such purposes. Participants
shall have no rights under the Plan other than as unsecured general
creditors of the Company, except that insofar as they may have become
entitled to payment of additional compensation by performance of
services, they shall have the same rights as other employees or service
providers under general law.

  



  

(m) _ _Reliance on Reports__. Each member of the Committee and each member
of the Board shall be fully justified in acting or failing to act, as the
case may be, and shall not be liable for having so acted or failed to act in
good faith, in reliance upon any report made by the independent public
accountant of the Company and its Affiliates and/or any other information
furnished in connection with the Plan by any agent of or service provider to
the Company or the Committee or the Board, other than himself.

  



  

(n) _ _Relationship to Other Benefits__. No payment under the Plan shall be
taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement,
profit sharing, group insurance or other benefit plan of the Company except as
otherwise specifically provided in such other plan.

  



  

(o) _ _Governing Law__. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed wholly within the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.

  



  

(p) _ _Severability__. If any provision of the Plan or any Award or Award
Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any person or entity or Award, or
would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the
Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to
the Applicable Laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without,
in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the
Plan or the Award, such provision shall be construed or deemed stricken as to
such jurisdiction, person or entity or Award and the remainder of the
Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

(q) _ _Obligations Binding on Successors__. The obligations of the Company
under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation
or organization resulting from the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
other reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or
organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business of the
Company.

  



  

   

M-1-19

 



    



  

(r) _ _Section 409A of the Code__.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, all Awards
made under this Plan are intended to be exempt from or, in the
alternative, comply with Section 409A of the Code and the authoritative
guidance thereunder, including the exceptions for stock rights and short-
term deferrals. The Plan shall be construed and interpreted in accordance
with such intent. Each payment under an Award shall be treated as a separate
payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(ii) If a Participant is a "specified employee" (as such term is defined for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code) at the time of his termination of
service, no amount that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code and that becomes payable by reason of such
termination of service shall be paid to the Participant (or in the event of
the Participant's death, the Participant's representative or estate) before
the earlier of (x) the first business day after the date that is six months
following the date of the Participant's termination of service, and (y) within
30 days following the date of the Participant's death. For purposes of
Section 409A of the Code, a termination of service shall be deemed to occur
only if it is a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code, and references in the Plan and any Award Agreement to
"termination of service" or similar terms shall mean a "separation from
service." If any Award is or becomes subject to Section 409A of the Code,
unless the applicable Award Agreement provides otherwise, such Award shall be
payable upon the Participant's "separation from service" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code. If any Award is or becomes subject to Section 409A
of the Code and if payment of such Award would be accelerated or
otherwise triggered under a Change in Control, then the definition of Change
in Control shall be deemed modified, only to the extent necessary to avoid
the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, to mean a
"change in control event" as such term is defined for purposes of Section
409A of the Code.

  



  

(iii) Any adjustments made pursuant to Section 12 to Awards that are subject
to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code, and any adjustments made pursuant to Section 12
to Awards that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in
such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either
(x) continue not to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or (y) comply with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(s) _ _Notification of Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code__. If any
Participant, in connection with the acquisition of Common Stock under an
Award, makes the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code, if
applicable, the Participant shall notify the Company of the election within
ten days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service.

  



  

(t) _ _Expenses ; Gender; Titles and Headings; Interpretation__. The
expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its
Affiliates. Masculine pronouns and other words of masculine gender shall refer
to both men and women. The titles and headings of the sections in the Plan
are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the
text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings shall control. Unless
the context of the Plan otherwise requires, words using the singular or
plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively;
derivative forms of defined terms will have correlative meanings; the terms
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer to
this entire Plan; the term "Section" refers to the specified Section of this
Plan and references to "paragraphs" or "clauses" shall be to separate
paragraphs or clauses of the Section or subsection in which the reference
occurs; the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be
followed by the phrase "without limitation"; and the word "or" shall be
disjunctive but not exclusive

  



  

(u) _ _Other Agreements__. Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may
require, as a condition to the grant of and/or the receipt of Common Stock or
other securities under an Award, that the Participant execute lock-up,
stockholder or other agreements, as it may determine in its sole and absolute
discretion.

  



  

   

M-1-20

 



    



  

(v) _ _Payments_. _Participants shall be required to pay, to the extent
required by Applicable Law, any amounts required to receive Common Stock or
other securities under any Award made under the Plan.

  



  

(w) _ _Clawback; Erroneously Awarded Compensation__. All Awards (including
on a retroactive basis) granted under the Plan are subject to the terms of
any Company forfeiture, incentive compensation recoupment, clawback or similar
policy as it may be in effect from time to time, as well as any similar
provisions of Applicable Laws, as well as any other policy of the Company that
may apply to the Awards, such as anti-hedging or pledging policies, as they
may be in effect from time to time. In particular, these policies
and/or provisions shall include, without limitation, (i) any Company policy
established to comply with Applicable Laws (including, without limitation,
Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), and/or (ii) the rules and
regulations of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation
system on which the shares of Common Stock or other securities are listed or
quoted, and these requirements shall be deemed incorporated by reference into
all outstanding Award Agreements.

  



  

(x) _ _No Fractional Shares__. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan. The Committee shall determine
whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu
of fractional shares or whether fractional shares or any rights thereto shall
be forfeited, rounded, or otherwise eliminated.

  



  

(y) _ _Paperless Administration__. If the Company establishes, for itself
or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the
documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an
internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless
documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Participant may be
permitted through the use of such an automated system.

  



  

(z) _ _Data Privacy.__ As a condition for receiving any Award, each
Participant explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and
transfer, in electronic or other form, of personal data as described in this
_Section 14(z)_ by and among the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
exclusively for implementing, administering and managing the Participant's
participation in the Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
may hold certain personal information about a Participant, including the
Participant's name, address and telephone number; birthdate; social security,
insurance number or other identification number; salary; nationality; job
title(s); any Common Stock held in the Company or its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates; and Award details, to implement, manage and administer the Plan
and Awards (the " _Data_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
may transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary to implement, administer
and manage a Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates may transfer the Data to third parties
assisting the Company with Plan implementation, administration and
management. These recipients may be located in the Participant's country, or
elsewhere, and the Participant's country may have different data privacy laws
and protections than the recipients' country. By accepting an Award, each
Participant authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and
transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, to implement, administer and
manage the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any required
Data transfer to a broker or other third party with whom the Company or the
Participant may elect to deposit any Common Stock. The Data related to a
Participant will be held only as long as necessary to implement, administer,
and manage the Participant's participation in the Plan. A Participant may, at
any time, view the Data that the Company holds regarding the Participant,
request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data
regarding the Participant, recommend any necessary corrections to the Data
regarding the Participant or refuse or withdraw the consents in this _Section
14(z)_ in writing, without cost, by contacting the local human resources
representative. The Company may cancel Participant's ability to
participate in the Plan and, in the Committee's discretion, the Participant
may forfeit any outstanding Awards if the Participant refuses or withdraws
the consents in this _Section 14(z)_.

  



  

   

M-1-21

 



    



  

(aa) __Broker-Assisted Sales__. In the event of a broker-assisted sale of
Common Stock in connection with the payment of amounts owed by a
Participant under or with respect to the Plan or Awards: (a) any Common Stock
to be sold through the broker-assisted sale will be sold on the day the
payment first becomes due, or as soon thereafter as practicable; (b) the
Common Stock may be sold as part of a block trade with other Participants in
the Plan in which all participants receive an average price; (c) the
applicable Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other
costs of sale, and by accepting an Award, each Participant agrees
to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages,
or expenses relating to any such sale; (d) to the extent the Company or its
designee receives proceeds of the sale that exceed the amount owed, the
Company will pay the excess in cash to the applicable Participant as soon as
reasonably practicable; (e) the Company and its designees are under no
obligation to arrange for the sale at any particular price; and (f) if the
proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the Participant's applicable
obligation, the Participant may be required to pay immediately upon demand to
the Company or its designee an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy any
remaining portion of the Participant's obligation.

of Parent Common Stock (the " _Earnout Shares_ ") into an escrow account (the
" _Escrow Account_ ") to be held in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Adjustment Escrow Shares and the Earnout Shares shall be held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



   | 1.| Appointment.  The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as
their escrow agent for the purposes set  forth herein, and the Escrow Agent
hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act  as Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

N-1

 



    



   | 2.| Deposit,  Delivery and Receipt of Escrow Shares; Other Actions. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| At  the Closing, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered
(unless delivered previously)  the Adjustment Escrow Shares and the Earnout
Shares to the Escrow Agent, to be held in  the Escrow Account. The Escrow
Agent will hold the Adjustment Escrow Shares and the Earnout  Shares,
together with any dividend or other distribution paid on such Adjustment
Escrow  Shares or Earnout Shares, as applicable (the " _Escrow Dividends_
"),  in escrow for the Stockholder Representative, or the Parent, as
applicable, and will  administer and disburse the Adjustment Escrow Shares,
the Earnout Shares and the Escrow  Dividends, if any, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The  Escrow Agent will hold the Adjustment Escrow Shares and the
Earnout Shares as a book-entry  position registered in the name of
"Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company,  as Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement, dated [●], 2021" until (i) any  such Adjustment Escrow
Shares are to be (x) released to the Stockholders Representative  for further
delivery to the Stockholders, or (y) otherwise released to Parent, in each 
case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement,
or (ii)  any such Earnout Shares are to be (x) released to the Stockholders
Representative for  further delivery to the Stockholders, or (y) otherwise
released to Parent, in each case,  in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| When  all or any portion of the Adjustment Escrow Shares or the
Earnout Shares are required  to be released under the Merger Agreement, the
Parties and Sponsor shall deliver joint  written instructions to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the security procedures set  forth in _Section 11_
and executed by Parent, the Stockholder Representative and  Sponsor (a "
_Release Notice_ "). The Parties agree that neither the Adjustment  Escrow
Shares nor the Earnout Shares shall be subject to attachment by any creditor
(including  any creditor of any party to the Merger Agreement). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| The  Escrow Agent does not own or have any interest in the
Adjustment Escrow Shares or the  Earnout Shares or any Escrow Dividends, but
is serving as escrow holder, having only  possession thereof and agreeing to
hold and distribute the Adjustment Escrow Shares or  the Earnout Shares and
any Escrow Dividends in accordance with the terms and conditions  set forth
herein. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| With  respect to the Adjustment Escrow Shares, Parent shall
retain all voting and economic  rights with respect to such Adjustment Escrow
Shares while such Adjustment Escrow Shares  remain deposited with the Escrow
Agent for so long as such Adjustment Escrow Shares are  held by the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall vote the Adjustment Escrow Shares solely  as
directed in writing by Parent. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

N-2

 



    



   | (f)| Any  Escrow Dividends shall be distributed to and held by the
Escrow Agent, and shall be disbursed  by the Escrow Agent together with and
when the Adjustment Escrow Shares or the Earnout  Shares, as applicable, on
which such Escrow Dividend was distributed are released, to  the same person
or entity to whom such Adjustment Escrow Shares or Earnout Shares, as 
applicable, are released in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For
the avoidance  of doubt, any release or distribution of the Adjustment Escrow
Shares or the Earnout  Shares in accordance with this Agreement shall also be
understood to include a distribution  of the Escrow Dividends, if any, with
respect to such released Adjustment Escrow Shares  or Earnout Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| Unless  otherwise instructed in writing jointly by the Parties,
the Escrow Agent shall hold the  Escrow Dividends in a "noninterest-bearing
deposit account" insured by the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("
_FDIC_ ") to the applicable limits. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (h)| The  Escrow Agent shall have no duty, responsibility or
obligation to invest any Escrow Dividends  held by it hereunder other than in
accordance with this _Section 2_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Release  Notices. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The  Escrow Agent shall disburse the Adjustment Escrow Shares
and the Earnout Shares only  in accordance with the Release Notice. Each such
Release Notice shall set forth in reasonable  detail the event giving rise to
the requested release and the specific release instructions  with respect
thereto (including the number of Adjustment Escrow Shares or Earnout Shares 
to be released and the identity of the person to whom they should be
released). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| If  the Adjustment Escrow Shares or the Earnout Shares are to be
released to the Stockholders  (as opposed to a release to Parent), the
specified number of Adjustment Escrow Shares  or Earnout Shares, as
applicable, (and the applicable portion of the Escrow Dividends)  shall be
released to the Stockholder Representative for further delivery to the
applicable  Stockholders as specified by the Stockholder Representative in
the Release Notice (in  which case, Parent shall have no liability for the
accuracy of, or compliance with the  terms of the Merger Agreement, or any
other document, of such instructions). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| If  the Merger Agreement requires that all or any portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Shares  or the Earnout Shares are to be released to Parent,
then the Release Notice shall specify  the number of Adjustment Escrow Shares
and the Earnout Shares, as applicable, to be released  to Parent (and the
applicable portion of the Escrow Dividends). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| In  the event an equitable adjustment is required under _Section
4(c)_ below, any Release  Notice shall also include reasonably detailed
information with respect to such equitable  adjustment. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

N-3

 



    



   | (e)| During  the period from the date of this Agreement until the
date upon which all of the Adjustment  Escrow Shares and the Earnout Shares
have been released, Parent and the Stockholder Representative  agree to
promptly and jointly issue all applicable Release Notices upon the
occurrence  of each release event, as such events are described in the Merger
Agreement (and in accordance  with _Section 4_ ). For the avoidance of doubt,
in the event of a conflict between  the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement, then, as between Parent and the  Stockholder
Representative, the terms of the Merger Agreement shall control and the
aforementioned  parties shall use reasonable best efforts to effect an
amendment to this Agreement (including  to _Section 4_ below). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Within  five (5) Business Days following the receipt of any
Release Notice and subject to the  receipt of required documentation for
compliance with applicable anti-money laundering  requirements, the Escrow
Agent shall release and deliver to the person or persons designated  in the
applicable Release Notice the number of Adjustment Escrow Shares or Earnout
Shares  set forth in such Release Notice by transfer of the relevant
Adjustment Escrow Shares  or Earnout Shares into the securities accounts
designated in such Release Notice. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| The  Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and be held
harmless for such reliance,  on any Release Notice for any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken in good faith  by it. The Escrow Agent shall
have no obligation to determine whether a release event  has occurred or is
contemplated to occur under the Merger Agreement, this Agreement (including, 
without limitation, under _Section 4_ ), or any other document. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (h)| For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean
any day other  than (a) a Saturday or a Sunday; (b) a day on which banking
and savings and  loan institutions are authorized or required by Law to be
closed in New York City, New  York; or (c) the location of the Escrow Agent's
offices in _Section 10_ are  authorized or required by law to close. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| Disbursement  and Termination. The Parties shall act in
accordance with, and the Escrow Agent shall  hold and release the Adjustment
Escrow Shares or the Earnout Shares as follows: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| _Earnout  Release_. If, during the thirty-six (36) month period
following the Closing Date (the  " _Earnout Period_ "), the closing price per
share of Parent Common Stock  on any twenty (20) trading days in any thirty
(30) consecutive day trading period (i)  equals or exceeds Fourteen Dollars
($14.00) (the " _First Share Price Trigger_ "),  or (ii) equals or exceeds
Sixteen Dollars ($16.00) (the " _Second Share Price  Trigger_ " and, together
with the First Share Price Trigger, each a " _Share  Price Trigger_ " and
collectively, the " _Share Price Triggers_ ")  then, for each Share Price
Trigger that is achieved, Two Million Five Hundred Thousand  (2,500,000)
shares of Parent Common Stock will be released from the Escrow Account. Upon 
receipt of a Release Notice with respect to any Earnout Shares, the Escrow
Agent shall,  promptly after receipt of such Release Notice, disburse such
Earnout Shares to the Stockholder  Representative, as applicable, in
accordance with such Release Notice. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

N-4

 



    



   | (i)| If,  during the Earnout Period, there is a qualifying Change of
Control in accordance with  Section 2.10 of the Merger Agreement, then any
Earnout Release that has not previously  been released from escrow to the
Stockholder Representative (whether or not previously  earned) shall be
deemed earned (and the applicable Share Price Trigger(s) achieved, as 
applicable), and Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly
deliver a Release  Notice directing the Escrow Agent to release from the
Escrow Account to Stockholder Representative  a number of shares equal to the
remaining Earnout Release(s) within ten (10) Business  Days following the
date of such qualifying Change of Control. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| If,  during the Earnout Period, there is a Final Determination
in accordance with Section  2.10 of the Merger Agreement that the
Stockholders are entitled to receive an Earnout  Release, then Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall jointly deliver a Release  Notice directing
the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to Stockholder
Representative  a number of shares equal to such Earnout Release within ten
(10) Business Days following  the date on which the applicable Share Price
Trigger was met or exceeded. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| If,  pursuant to Section 2.10 of the Merger Agreement, it is
finally determined that the Stockholders  are not entitled to or eligible to
receive any further Earnout Releases, Parent and Stockholder  Representative
shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account  to
Parent for immediate cancellation of all such Earnout Shares that have not
been released. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| _Escrow  Termination Date_. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 8_ , this Agreement shall  terminate after all of the Adjustment
Escrow Shares and the Earnout Shares and Escrow  Dividends have been released
from the Escrow Account. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| _Records_.  The Escrow Agent shall keep proper books of record
and account in which full and correct  entries shall be made of all release
activity in the Escrow Account. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| Escrow  Agent. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The  Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are
specifically and expressly provided  herein, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and no other duties shall  be implied. The Escrow
Agent shall not have any fiduciary, partnership or joint venture 
relationship with any Party or any other person or entity arising out of or in
connection  with this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The  Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for, nor chargeable
with, knowledge of, nor have  any requirements to comply with, the terms and
conditions of any other agreement, instrument  or document among the Parties,
in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation  the Merger
Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any person 
or entity has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional
obligations  of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such
agreements, even though reference  thereto may be made in this Agreement. In
the event of any conflict between the terms  and provisions of this
Agreement, those of the Merger Agreement, any schedule or exhibit  attached
to this Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties, the terms and
conditions  of this Agreement shall govern and control in all respects
relating to the Escrow Agent,  but in every other respect involving the
parties and beneficiaries of any such other  agreement, the other agreement
shall control. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

N-5

 



    



   | (c)| The  Escrow Agent may rely upon, and shall not be liable for
acting or refraining from acting  upon, any Release Notice or other written
notice, document, instruction or request furnished  to it hereunder and
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or  presented
by the proper Party or Parties without inquiry and without requiring
substantiating  evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to
any Party, any beneficiary,  or other person or entity for refraining from
acting upon any Release Notice or other  written notice, document,
instruction or request furnished to it hereunder setting forth,  claiming,
containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution of the 
Adjustment Escrow Shares or the Earnout Shares, or any portion thereof, unless
such Release  Notice or other written notice, document, instruction or notice
shall have been delivered  to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section
11_ below and the Escrow Agent has  been able to satisfy any applicable
security procedures as may be required hereunder  and as set forth in
_Section 11_. The Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to  inquire into
or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document,
notice,  instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to
solicit any receipt of  the Adjustment Escrow Shares or the Earnout Shares
which may be due to it or the Escrow  Account, nor shall the Escrow Agent
have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify  the accuracy or correctness
of any number or class of Adjustment Escrow Shares or Earnout  Shares
deposited with it hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| The  Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken  by it in good faith except to the extent
that a final adjudication of a court of competent  jurisdiction determines
that the Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful  misconduct was
the primary cause of any loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute 
any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through
affiliates  or agents, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken, suffered or  omitted to be taken by any such attorney or agent
in good faith, absent fraud, gross  negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct (each as determined by a final, nonappealable  judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction) in the selection and continued employment 
thereof. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and other
skilled persons  to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for any action  taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
accordance with, or in reasonable reliance  upon, the advice or opinion of
any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons.  In the event that
the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is some ambiguity  as to
its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or
demands  from any Party which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the
provisions of this Agreement,  it shall be entitled to refrain from taking
any action, and its sole obligation shall  be to keep safely all property
held in escrow until it shall be given a direction in  writing by the Parties
which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction  of Escrow
Agent or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of
competent  jurisdiction. To the extent practicable, the Parties agree to
pursue any redress or recourse  in connection with any dispute arising under
the Merger Agreement (other than with respect  to a dispute involving the
Escrow Agent) without making the Escrow Agent a party to the  same. Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the 
Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or
consequential loss  or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if  the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless  of the form of action. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

N-6

 



    



   | 6.| Succession. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The  Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties
or obligations hereunder by  giving thirty (30) days advance notice (pursuant
to _Section 10_ ) in writing of  such resignation to the Parties specifying a
date when such resignation shall take effect.  By delivery of joint written
instructions by the Parties to the Escrow Agent, the Parties  shall have the
right to terminate their appointment of the Escrow Agent, or successor 
escrow agent, as Escrow Agent, upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Escrow
Agent.  If the Escrow Agent shall resign, be removed or otherwise become
incapable of acting,  the Parties shall appoint a successor to be the Escrow
Agent. If the Parties have failed  to appoint a successor escrow agent prior
to the expiration of thirty (30) days after  giving notice of such removal or
following the receipt of the notice of resignation or  incapacity, the Escrow
Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the  appointment
of a successor escrow agent within the relevant jurisdiction or for other 
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the  parties hereto. The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such
thirty (30) day  notice period expires shall be to hold the Adjustment Escrow
Shares and the Earnout Shares  (without any obligation to reinvest the same)
and to deliver the same to a designated  substitute escrow agent as jointly
instructed in writing by the Parties, if any, or in  accordance with the
directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction,  at which time of delivery, the Escrow Agent's obligations
hereunder shall cease  and terminate, subject to the provisions of _Section
8_ hereunder. The Escrow Agent  shall have the right to withhold monies or
property in an amount equal to any amount  due and then owing to the Escrow
Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent  shall reasonably believe
may be incurred by the Escrow Agent that the Parties are obligated  to
indemnify or reimburse the Escrow Agent for pursuant to this Agreement in
connection  with the termination of this Agreement, so long as the Escrow
Agent has previously submitted  a written invoice in respect thereof to the
Parties that the Parties have not paid within  thirty (30) days of receipt of
such invoice. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

N-7

 



    



   | (b)| Any  entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be  consolidated, or any entity to which all
or substantially all the escrow business may  be transferred, shall be the
Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further action  on the part of any
party hereto. The Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Parties in  the
event this occurs. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Every  successor escrow agent appointed hereunder shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to  its predecessor, and also to the Parties, an
instrument in writing accepting such appointment  hereunder, and thereupon
such successor escrow agent, without any further action, shall  become fully
vested with all the rights, immunities and powers and shall be subject to 
all of the duties and obligations, of its predecessor; and every predecessor
escrow agent  shall deliver all property and moneys held by it hereunder to
such successor escrow agent,  at which time of delivery the Escrow Agent's
obligations hereunder shall cease  and terminate, subject to the provisions
of _Section 8_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| Compensation  and Reimbursement. Parent agrees to (a) pay the
Escrow Agent upon execution of this  Agreement, and from time to time
thereafter, all reasonable compensation for the services  to be rendered
hereunder by the Escrow Agent as described in _Schedule 2_ attached  hereto,
and (b) pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for all reasonable,
out-of-pocket  and documented expenses, disbursements and advances,
including, without limitation, reasonable  attorney's fees and expenses,
incurred or made by it in connection with the performance,  modification and
termination of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.| Indemnity. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Subject  to _Section 8(c)_ below, the Escrow Agent shall be
liable for any and all losses,  damages, claims, costs, charges, penalties
and related interest, counsel fees and expenses,  payments, expenses and
liability (collectively, " _Losses_ "), only to  the extent such Losses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result  of its own
fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; provided, however, 
that any liability of the Escrow Agent will be limited in the aggregate to the
aggregate  value of the Adjustment Escrow Shares, the Earnout Shares and the
Earnout Dividends deposited  with the Escrow Agent. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The  Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from  and against, and the Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for, any and all Losses arising  out of or attributable to the
Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement or this  appointment, including
the reasonable, out-of-pocket and documented costs and expenses  of defending
itself against any Losses or enforcing this Agreement (collectively, "
_Agent  Claims_ "), except to the extent that such Losses are determined by a
court of  competent jurisdiction to be a result of the Escrow Agent's own
fraud, gross negligence,  bad faith or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and except as provided  in _Section 7_ , as between
themselves, the Parties agree that any Agent Claims payable  hereunder shall
be paid (or reimbursed, as applicable): (a) in the case that the Agent  Claim
is not attributable to actions or inactions of any particular Party, by
Parent;  and (b) in the event that the Agent Claim is attributable to the
actions or inactions  of a certain Party, by such Party (and such Party shall
reimburse the other Parties,  in the event that such other Party(ies) has
made indemnification payments under this  _Section 8(b)_ in respect of such
Agent Claim). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

N-8

 



    



   | (c)| Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Parties or the Escrow Agent shall  be liable for any incidental,
punitive, indirect, special or consequential damages of  any nature
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, loss of anticipated profits,
occasioned  by a breach of any provision of this Agreement even if apprised
of the possibility of  such damages. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| In  order that the indemnification provisions contained in this
_Section 8_ shall apply,  upon the assertion of a claim for which one party
may be required to indemnify the other,  the party seeking indemnification
shall promptly notify the other party of such assertion  in writing after it
becomes aware, and shall keep the other party advised with respect  to all
developments concerning such claim; provided, that failure to give prompt
notice  shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party, except  to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that the defense of such action  has been materially prejudiced
by the indemnified party's failure to timely give  such notice. The
indemnifying party shall have the option to participate with the indemnified 
party in the defense of such claim or to defend against said claim in its own
name or  the name of the indemnified party unless such claim is (i) brought
by the indemnified  party or (ii) the indemnified party reasonably determines
that there may be a conflict  of interest between the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party in the defense of  such claim and the indemnified
party does in fact assume the defense. The indemnified  party shall in no
case confess any claim, make any compromise or take any action adverse  to
the indemnifying party in any case in which the indemnifying party may be
required  to indemnify it, except with the indemnifying party's prior written
consent, which  shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| For  the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8_ shall survive
termination of this Agreement  or the resignation, replacement or removal of
the Escrow Agent for any reason. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| Patriot  Act Disclosure/Taxpayer Identification Numbers/Tax
Reporting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Patriot  Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing  Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (" _USA  PATRIOT Act_ ") requires the
Escrow Agent to implement reasonable procedures  to verify the identity of
any person that opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the  Parties
acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agent's 
identity verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain applicable
information  which is required to confirm the Parties' identity including
without limitation  name, address and organizational documents (collectively,
" _Identifying Information_ ").  The Parties agree to provide the Escrow
Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining  from third parties any
Identifying Information required as a condition of opening an  account with
or using any service provided by the Escrow Agent for the purposes of this 
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

N-9

 



    



   | (b)| Certification  and Tax Reporting. The Parties have provided, or
promptly following the date hereof  will provide, the Escrow Agent with their
respective fully executed Internal Revenue  Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-8 or
Form W-9, as applicable. The Escrow Agent  shall make such reports to the
applicable tax authorities as directed by Parent and shall  have no
obligation under this Agreement to make any other reports with respect to
taxes.  If required by law, the Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it
deems appropriate in  the absence of proper tax documentation or as required
by law, and shall remit such taxes  to the appropriate authorities. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.| Notices.  All notices, demands and other communications given
pursuant to the terms and provisions  hereof shall be in writing, except for
communications from the Parties setting forth,  claiming, containing,
objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or distribution  of
funds, including but not limited to funds transfer instructions (all of which
shall  be specifically governed by _Section 11_ below), shall be deemed
effective on the  date of receipt, and may be sent by:

the appropriate notice address  set forth below or at such other address as

   | (b)| In  the event transfer instructions are so received by the
Escrow Agent by facsimile or other  electronic submission (including e-mail),
the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation  of such instructions by
telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule  1
hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone

may  select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully
executed incumbency  certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting  to be any such officer as confirmation on
behalf of the Stockholder Representative. 
---|---|---

trust property shall be attached,  garnished or levied upon by any court
order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed  or enjoined by an order of a
court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or  entered by any
court affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow 
Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and
comply with  all writs, orders, judgments or decrees so entered or issued,
which it is advised by  legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it,
whether with or without jurisdiction,  and in the event that the Escrow Agent
obeys or complies with any such writ, order, judgment  or decree, it shall
not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person,  entity,
firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, 
order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or

breakdowns  or malfunctions, interruptions or malfunction of computer
facilities, or loss of data  due to power failures or mechanical difficulties

---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed  an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  All signatures of the
parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or pdf  (including

   | (f)| _Severability_.  If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court  of competent jurisdiction
or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable by  reason of any
applicable law of a jurisdiction, then the remainder of the terms,
provisions,  covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and  shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

N-13

 



    



   | (g)| _Interpretation_.  When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, such reference shall be to a  Section of this Agreement unless

are used in this Agreement they shall  be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The table of  contents and headings set forth in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes  only and shall not

   | (h)| _Enforcement,  Remedies and Compliance_. A person or entity who
is not a party to this Agreement  shall have no right to enforce any term of
this Agreement. Each Party represents, warrants  and covenants that each
document, notice, instruction or request provided by such Party  to the
Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and regulations. Where,
however,  the conflicting provisions of any such applicable law may be
waived, they are hereby  irrevocably waived by the parties hereto to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to the  end that this Agreement shall be
enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in  _Section 8_ above,
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall  be construed to
give to any person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and the Parties  any
legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in respect of
this Agreement  or any funds escrowed hereunder. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or as  between the applicable Parties in the Merger
Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly  conferred upon a party
hereto will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any  other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise  by a
party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO  THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY

OR CAUSE OF ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF  OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR IN ANY WAY  CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF 
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER
NOW EXISTING  OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR
OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY  HERETO HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY
SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE  OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES HERETO  MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN  EVIDENCE
OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY  JURY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT  OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH  OTHER PARTY HERETO WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVER,  (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH  WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
