       effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights, the
       share of Cascade Special Voting Stock shall not be converted pursuant to
       Section 3.2, and the holder of the share of Cascade Special Voting Stock
       shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Applicable Law.

           (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) above, if the
       holder of the share of Cascade Special Voting Stock demands appraisal of
       such share under the OBCA and subsequently effectively withdraws or loses
       (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal then, as
       of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
       holder's share shall represent one share of special voting stock of the
       Surviving Corporation.

           (iii) Cascade shall give the Parent (A) prompt notice of a written
       demand for appraisal of the share of Cascade Special Voting Stock,
       withdrawal of such demand, and any other instruments served pursuant to
       the OBCA and received by Cascade and (B) the opportunity to participate
       in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
       under the OBCA.

    3.3  OPTIONS.

        (a)  At the Effective Time each Optionee who elects to exercise an
Option pursuant to Section 12(a) of the Option Plan, which had an Exercise Price
less than the Per Share Price, shall be entitled to receive for each Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any other action on the part of the Optionee, cash in an amount equal to
(i) the number of shares of Cascade Common Stock for which such Option was
exercisable immediately

                                      A-5

<PAGE>

prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Per Share
Price over the Exercise Price (the "Option Consideration").

        (b)  At the Effective Time, each Option which then has an Exercise Price
in excess of the Per Share Price, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Optionee, shall be canceled, without any conversion thereof.

        (c)  All Optionees shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to have any
rights as Option holders of Cascade and their sole right, if any, shall be the
right to receive the Option Consideration, without interest, as determined and
paid in the manner set forth in Section 3.5.

    3.4  ACQUISITION CO. COMMON STOCK.  Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Acquisition Co. (the "Acquisition Co. Common Stock"), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into and exchangeable for one fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation Common Stock"). From and after the Effective Time, each outstanding
certificate theretofore representing shares of Acquisition Co. Common Stock
shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership of and to represent the
number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which such shares of
Acquisition Co. Common Stock shall have been converted. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall issue to the Parent a stock
certificate or certificates representing one share of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock for each share of Acquisition Co. Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in exchange for the
certificate or certificates which formerly represented shares of Acquisition Co.
Common Stock, which shall be canceled.

    3.5  PAYMENT FOR CASCADE COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS.

        (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall designate a business
entity regularly engaged in such work and which is reasonably satisfactory to
Cascade to act as Paying Agent with respect to the Merger (the "Paying Agent").
Each record holder (other than Parent, Acquisition Co. or any other subsidiary
of Parent) of Cascade Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be entitled to receive upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of the
certificates representing such shares of Cascade Common Stock (the
"Certificates") for cancellation and (ii) delivery to the Paying Agent of the
letter of transmittal referred to in the last sentence of this Section 3.5(a),
duly completed and executed, and any other items specified in such letter of
transmittal, cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of shares of
Cascade Common Stock previously represented by the Certificates multiplied by
the Per Share Price, subject to any required withholding of taxes. Each holder
of Options that have an Exercise Price which is less than the Per Share Price
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to receive upon
(i) surrender to the Paying Agent of all such Option agreements held by such
Person evidencing the number of shares of Cascade Common Stock into which such
Options were exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) delivery to the Paying Agent of the letter of transmittal referred to in
the last sentence of this Section 3.5(a), duly completed and executed, and any
other items specified in such letter of transmittal, cash in an amount equal to
the aggregate Option Consideration for all such Options, subject to any required
withholding of taxes. At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Co. shall
make available to the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments in
amounts determined pursuant to the preceding sentences. No interest shall accrue
or be paid on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or the
Options. Any funds delivered or made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
this Section 3.5(a) and not exchanged for Certificates or Options within six
months after the Effective Time will be returned by the Paying Agent to the
Surviving Corporation, which thereafter will act as Paying Agent, subject to the
rights of holders of unsurrendered Certificates or Options under this
Section 3.5(a), and any former holders who have not previously exchanged their
Certificates or Options will thereafter be entitled to

                                      A-6

<PAGE>

look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the
consideration set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.3, respectively, without any
interest, but will have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than
may be accorded to general creditors thereof under Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto
shall be liable to a holder of shares of Cascade Common Stock or Options for any
cash or interest delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
record holder of shares of Cascade Common Stock and each holder of Options that
have an Exercise Price which is less than the Per Share Price immediately prior
to the Effective Time (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which will specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
or Options will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or Options
to the Paying Agent), which letter shall be in customary form, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Options for payment.

        (b)  With respect to any Certificate or Option alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the owner or owners of such Certificate or Option
shall be entitled to the consideration set forth above upon delivery to the
Surviving Corporation of the other items set forth in Section 3.5(a) and an
affidavit of such owner or owners setting forth such allegation and an indemnity
agreement to indemnify the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent against any claim that may be made against any, some or all of them on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such Certificate or
Option or the delivery of the payment set forth above.

        (c)  If consideration is to be delivered to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Option surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to delivery of the consideration that the
Certificate or Option so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such consideration shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Option surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

        (d)  Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 3.5, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each Certificate (other than
(A) Certificates representing shares of Cascade Common Stock owned beneficially
or of record by the Parent, Acquisition Co. or any other subsidiary of the
Parent, and (B) Certificates representing shares of Cascade Common Stock held in
Cascade's treasury or by any Cascade Subsidiary) shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the Per Share Price for each share
represented by such Certificate, as determined and paid in the manner set forth
in this Agreement and (ii) each Option that has an Exercise Price which is less
than the Per Share Price immediately prior to the Effective Time shall represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the Option Consideration, as
determined and paid in the manner set forth in this Agreement.

        (e)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Cascade Common Stock that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Options are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and presented to the Paying Agent for payment (subject to
Section 3.5(a)) of the applicable consideration referred to in this
Section 3.5.

    3.6  ADJUSTMENT TO PREVENT DILUTION.  In the event that Cascade changes the
number of shares of Cascade Common Stock, Options or other securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Cascade Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization,

                                      A-7

<PAGE>

merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Price shall be equitably adjusted.

                                   ARTICLE 4
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CASCADE

    Cascade hereby represents and warrants to the Parent and Acquisition Co. as
follows:

    4.1  ORGANIZATION, ETC.

        (a)  Cascade is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Oregon and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Cascade is duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted
by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
jurisdiction where Cascade is so qualified is listed on Schedule 4.1(a). Except
as set forth on Schedule 4.1(b), there are no Cascade Subsidiaries and, except
as set forth on Schedule 4.1(b) and except with respect to the Exchangeable
Shares, Cascade does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of or
equity interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity,
nor is Cascade bound by any agreement to acquire any such capital stock or
equity interest. Cascade has heretofore delivered or made available to the
Parent accurate and complete copies of the Restated Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws of Cascade, each as amended and in effect on the date hereof. The
stock certificate books and ledgers of Cascade, which have been made available
to the Parent, accurately reflect, at the date hereof, the ownership of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Cascade.

        (b)  Each Cascade Subsidiary is listed on Schedule 4.1(b). Each Material
Cascade Subsidiary and, to Cascade's Knowledge, each Immaterial Cascade
Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry out its business as now being conducted. Each Material Cascade
Subsidiary and, to Cascade's Knowledge, each Immaterial Cascade Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each jurisdiction where each Material Cascade Subsidiary is so qualified
is listed on Schedule 4.1(b). Cascade has delivered to the Parent accurate and
complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of each Material
Cascade Subsidiary, as amended and in effect on the date hereof.

        (c)  Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(c), Cascade owns of record and
beneficially 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock and all other
equity interest in each Cascade Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens.

    4.2  AUTHORIZATION AND BINDING OBLIGATION.

        (a)  Cascade has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to the approvals referred to in Section 6.1, Cascade's
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Cascade and this
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Cascade. Except for the
actions referred to in Section 4.2(b), which actions are in full force and
effect, and the giving of notice in accordance with Sections 60.214,

                                      A-8

<PAGE>

60.561 and 60.567 of the OBCA, no other corporate action or proceedings on the
part of Cascade are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of Cascade, enforceable against Cascade in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar rights of creditors generally and by
general principles of equity.

        (b)  The Cascade Board of Directors (the "Board") has authorized the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and has voted to recommend adoption of this
Agreement and authorization of the Merger by the shareholders of Cascade, and
has not withdrawn such authorization. A true and complete copy of such approvals
by the Board has been delivered to the Parent.

        (c)  The Board has taken all appropriate action so that the entry into
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be exempted from the provisions of OBCA 60.801-60.816 and
60.825-60.845. No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition"
or similar anti-takeover statute or regulation, including, without limitation,
OBCA 60.801-60.816 and 60.825-60.845 (each, a "Takeover Statute"), or any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Restated Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Cascade is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to Cascade,
the shares of Cascade Common Stock, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

    4.3  CAPITALIZATION.

        (a)  The authorized Cascade Common Stock and other authorized capital
stock of Cascade and each of the Cascade Subsidiaries is as set forth on
Schedule 4.3. All issued and outstanding shares of Cascade Common Stock and
other equity interest of Cascade and each of the Cascade Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive
rights. Schedule 4.3 sets forth the name of each Person who owns beneficially or
of record any shares of capital stock and other equity interest of any Cascade
Subsidiary and, in the case of each Cascade Subsidiary, the number of shares
owned by each such Person. Other than the Exchangeable Shares and the share of
Cascade Special Voting Stock, there are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness or securities of Cascade or of any Cascade Subsidiary issued and
outstanding which have the right to vote (or are convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter on which
shareholders of Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary may vote.

        (b)  Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3, there are not now, and at the
Effective Time there will not be, any options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
or other rights, agreements or commitments of any nature whatsoever obligating
Cascade or any of the Cascade Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, transferred, delivered or sold, any additional shares of
Cascade Common Stock or other equity interest of Cascade or any of the Cascade
Subsidiaries, or any securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable
for any such Cascade Common Stock or other equity interest, or obligating
Cascade or any of the Cascade Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into such
agreement or commitment, and no authorization therefor has been given or made by
Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary. Except for the arrangements described in
Schedule 4.3, there are no contractual arrangements that obligate Cascade or any
Cascade Subsidiary to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its
capital stock or other equity interest or (ii) pay any Person any consideration
that is calculated with reference to the consideration to be paid to the Cascade
shareholders under this Agreement.

        (c)  Except as set forth in Section 5.7, there are not now, and at the
Effective Time there will not be, any shareholder agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which

                                      A-9

<PAGE>

Cascade is a party or by which it is bound relating to the voting of any shares
of the capital stock of Cascade which will limit the granting of proxies by or
on behalf of or from, or the casting of votes by, Cascade stockholders with
respect to the Merger. There are no restrictions on the ability of Cascade to
vote the stock of any of the Cascade Subsidiaries.

    4.4  CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS.  Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.4 and for (a) the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the
Exchange Act, (b) the approvals referred to in Section 4.2(b), (c) the giving of
notice in accordance with Section 60.214 of the OBCA and (d) the filing and
recordation of the Articles of Merger as required by the OBCA, no filing with,
and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority
or other third party is necessary for the consummation by Cascade of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except where the failure to make
such filing or obtain such authorization, consent or approval would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Subject to obtaining such approvals and making such
filings, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cascade nor the
consummation by Cascade of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Cascade with any of the provisions hereof, will (a) result in any violation
of any provision of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Cascade
or any Cascade Subsidiary, (b) violate any Applicable Law to which Cascade or
any of the Cascade Subsidiaries is subject or by which any of their respective
properties is bound or (c) except as set forth on Schedule 4.4, result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default or give rise to a right of any Person to terminate,
cancel or accelerate the payment or performance of any liability, obligation or
commitment under any contract (including any Contract listed in Schedule 4.13)
to which Cascade or any of the Cascade Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any
of their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses
(b) and (c) above, where such violation, breach, default or right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

    4.5  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; SEC REPORTS.

        (a)  Cascade has furnished the Parent with (i) a consolidated balance
sheet of Cascade as of January 31, 2000 and statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows of Cascade for the year then ended, together
with the related audit report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and (ii) an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Cascade as of July 31, 2000 and
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows of Cascade
for the six-month period ended July 31, 2000. All such financial statements are
referred to herein collectively as the "Financial Statements." The Financial
Statements (including any related schedules or notes) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP throughout the periods involved, except that the unaudited
financial statements are subject to year-end adjustments and do not contain
detailed footnotes. The balance sheets included in the Financial Statements
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of Cascade and
the Cascade Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and the consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows included in
the Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the results
of the operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows, respectively,
of Cascade and the Cascade Subsidiaries for the periods indicated.

        (b)  Cascade has filed all forms, reports, amendments to reports,
statements and schedules with the SEC required to be filed pursuant to the
Exchange Act, and the regulations of the SEC thereunder, since January 1, 1998.
As of their respective dates and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then as of the date of such
filing, all reports (including the financial statements included or incorporated
therein) filed by Cascade with the SEC (collectively, the "SEC Reports")
complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such SEC
Reports, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact

                                      A-10

<PAGE>

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

    4.6  UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.  Except (a) to the extent reflected or
reserved against in the January 31, 2000 balance sheet of Cascade included in
the Financial Statements, (b) to the extent disclosed in the SEC Reports,
(c) to the extent incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since January 31, 2000, (d) to the extent set forth on
Schedule 4.6, or (e) for obligations of Cascade arising in the ordinary course
of the performance of its responsibilities under any Contracts listed on
Schedule 4.13 or any agreement which is not required to be listed on
Schedule 4.13 because of the limitations set forth in Section 4.13, neither
Cascade nor any Cascade Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether liquidated, unliquidated, accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

    4.7  GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS AND AUTHORIZATIONS.  All approvals, permits,
qualifications, authorizations, licenses, franchises, consents, orders,
registrations or other approvals (collectively, the "Governmental Approvals") of
all Governmental Authorities which are necessary in order to permit Cascade and
the Cascade Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses have been
obtained and are in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain
such approval, permit, qualification, authorization, license, franchise,
consent, order, registration or other approval, or the failure to be in full
force and effect, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no
violation, cancellation, suspension or revocation of any such Governmental
Approval, except for any such violation, cancellation, suspension or revocation
which would not have a Material Adverse Effect. This Section 4.7 does not relate
to environmental matters, which are the subject of Section 4.21.

    4.8  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Except for any such violations, breaches or
defaults which would not have a Material Adverse Effect, neither Cascade nor any
Cascade Subsidiary is in conflict with or in violation or breach of or default
under (a) any provision of its organizational documents or (b) to the Knowledge
of Cascade, Applicable Law, and, since January 31, 2000, neither Cascade nor any
Cascade Subsidiary has to its Knowledge received any written notice alleging any
such conflict, violation, breach or default. This Section 4.8 does not relate to
environmental matters, which are the subject of Section 4.21.

    4.9  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS.  Neither Cascade, any Cascade Subsidiary,
or any director, officer, employee or agent of, or consultant or other
representative of, Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary, or any other Person
authorized to act on behalf thereof, has unlawfully offered, paid or agreed to
pay, directly or indirectly, any money or anything of value to or for the
benefit of any individual who is or was an official or employee or candidate for
office of any Governmental Authority, or any employee or agent of any customer
or supplier of Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary, except for any such offer,
payment or agreement to pay which would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Material Adverse Effect and would not reasonably be expected to subject
Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary to any damage or penalty in any civil,
criminal or governmental litigation or proceeding.

    4.10  REAL PROPERTY.  Schedule 4.10 sets forth a complete list of (a) all
real property and all interests in real property owned in fee by Cascade or the
Cascade Subsidiaries (individually, an "Owned Property") and (b) all real
property and all interests in real property leased by Cascade or the Material
Cascade Subsidiaries (individually, "Leased Property;" and together with the
Owned Property, the "Real Property"). Cascade and the Cascade Subsidiaries have
(a) good, marketable and insurable fee title to all Owned Property, and
(b) good valid leasehold interests in all Leased Property, and in the case of
the Owned Property and those leasehold estates set forth on Schedule 4.10, such
title is free and clear of any Liens, except (i) those created or permitted
under the credit agreements listed on Schedule 4.13, (ii) as disclosed on
Schedule 4.10, and (iii) other easements, rights of way and immaterial Liens,
charges, assessments or encumbrances that do not interfere with the use of the
Real Property in the normal conduct of the business of Cascade and the Cascade
Subsidiaries and that do

                                      A-11

<PAGE>

not materially impair the value of the Real Property (collectively, the
"Permitted Liens"). Complete and correct copies of each deed or lease relating
to the Real Property described on Schedule 4.10 have been furnished or made
available to the Parent. The current use and operation of the Real Property does
not violate in any material respect any instrument of record affecting the Real
Property. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.10, no damage or destruction has
occurred with respect to any of the Real Property since January 31, 2000 that
would individually or in the aggregate materially impair the continued use or
operation of the Owned Property or the Leased Property. To the Knowledge of
Cascade, the Owned Property is in compliance with all Real Estate Laws and
neither Cascade nor any Cascade Subsidiary has received any written notice of
violation or claimed violation of any Real Estate Law, in either case except
where such violation or lack of compliance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.10, neither Cascade nor any Cascade
Subsidiary is obligated under or a party to any option, right of first refusal
or other contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell or dispose of any Real
Property. Neither Cascade nor any Cascade Subsidiary is a lessor, sublessor or
grantor under any lease, sublease or other instrument granting to another Person
any right to the possession, lease, occupancy or enjoyment of the Real Property,
other than pursuant to the agreements listed under the captions "Cascade
Subleases" and "Miscellaneous Encumbrances Upon Real Property" on Schedule 4.10
and except where such right to possession, lease, occupancy or enjoyment of the
Real Property would not materially interfere with the use of the Real Property
in the normal conduct of the business of Cascade and the Cascade Subsidiaries.
This Section 4.10 does not relate to environmental matters, which are the
subject of Section 4.21.

    4.11  PERSONAL PROPERTY.  Cascade and each of the Cascade Subsidiaries has
good and valid title to all tangible personal property and assets which it owns,
including the material tangible personal property reflected in the balance sheet
included in the Financial Statements as being owned by Cascade or such Cascade
Subsidiary, as the case may be, except for such tangible personal property and
assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice, since January 31, 2000.

    4.12  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  Cascade and each of the Cascade Subsidiaries
possesses all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and
licenses that are necessary for the use or ownership of its respective
properties and assets, and the maintenance and operation of its respective
businesses as currently conducted. Neither Cascade nor any of the Cascade
Subsidiaries uses any registered trademarks, trade names, copyrights or patents
(or has applications therefor pending) in connection with their respective
businesses, except those set forth on Schedule 4.12 (collectively referred to as
the "Intellectual Property"). Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12, the
Intellectual Property is owned by Cascade or a Cascade Subsidiary, as indicated
on Schedule 4.12, and is not subject to any license, royalty arrangement or
dispute. To the Knowledge of Cascade, no registered trademark or trade name used
by Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary infringes on any trademark or trade name in
any state or country in which such trademark or trade name is used by Cascade or
such Cascade Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Cascade and except as set forth on
Schedule 4.12, neither Cascade nor any Cascade Subsidiary has received written
notification of infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark or trade name,
or any application therefor, from any Person.

    4.13  CONTRACTS.  Schedule 4.13 lists (or describes in the case of oral
contracts) each contract, note, debt instrument, lease, sublease, covenant not
to compete, supply agreement, guarantee, licensing agreement, partnership
agreement, joint venture agreement, employment agreement (other than agreements
set forth on Schedule 4.14), collective bargaining agreement or other agreement
or commitment of any kind, whether written or oral, to which Cascade or any
Cascade Subsidiary is a party (other than agreements set forth on
Schedule 4.14) or by which any of them is bound (each, a "Contract"), provided
that such Schedule need not list any written or oral Contract or related written
Contracts under which the aggregate payments required to be made by or to
Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary over the life of the Contract or Contracts are

each material bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, severance, retention,
change in control, equity incentive or other material employee benefit plan,
program or policy maintained or contributed to by Cascade or any Cascade
Subsidiary for the benefit of its respective employees or with respect to which
Cascade or a Cascade Subsidiary is obligated to contribute on behalf of its
employees (collectively, the "Plans"). In addition, Schedule 4.14 sets forth a

        (b)  Each Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a determination letter from the IRS as to the qualification thereof
under Section 401(a) of the Code; and, to the Knowledge of Cascade, no amendment

the Code. Each of the Plans has been operated and administered in all respects
in accordance with Applicable Law, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code, except where any such noncompliance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. There are no material pending or, to the Knowledge of Cascade,
threatened claims by or on behalf of any of the Plans or by any employee

to any Plan pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, ERISA and
the Code) have been made on a timely basis.

any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to Title IV
of ERISA, which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

        (d)  No Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or

    6.5  ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.

        (a)  From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Cascade shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director,
employee, representative or agent, (i) solicit or initiate any inquiries or
proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock
(including without limitation pursuant to a tender offer) or similar transaction
or series of transactions involving Cascade, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals
being referred to in this Agreement as an "Acquisition Proposal"), or
(ii) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public
information to any person or entity relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) agree to, approve or recommend to its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Cascade, the Board or any committee thereof from (A) furnishing
non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any person or entity in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by such person or entity (including a new and unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal received by Cascade after the execution of this Agreement
from a person or entity whose initial contact with Cascade may have been
solicited by Cascade or on its behalf prior to the execution of this Agreement)
or recommending such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to
the shareholders of Cascade, if and only to the extent that (1) such Acquisition
Proposal is not subject to any financing or material due diligence conditions
and the Board or any committee thereof believes in good faith (after
consultation with and based upon the advice of its financial advisor) that such
person or entity has the financial capacity to consummate such Acquisition
Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a
transaction more favorable to Cascade shareholders from a financial point of
view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more
favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a
"Superior Proposal") and the Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel
that such action is necessary for the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties
to Cascade's shareholders under applicable law, and (2) prior to furnishing such
non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such person or entity, Cascade receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to Cascade than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2000, between
Cascade and TD Capital Group Limited or (B) complying with Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal.
Cascade will immediately notify the Parent of the existence of any proposal,
discussion, negotiation or inquiry received by Cascade, and Cascade will
immediately communicate to the Parent the terms of any proposal, discussion,
negotiation or inquiry which it may receive (and will immediately provide to the
Parent copies of any written materials received by Cascade in connection with
such proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry) and the identity of the party
making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or negotiation.
Cascade will promptly provide to the Parent any non-public information
concerning Cascade provided to any other party which was not previously provided
to the Parent.

        (b)  In the event a Superior Proposal is received by the Board or any
committee thereof, and the Board or such committee proposes to endorse or accept
such Superior Proposal, the Board or such committee shall promptly advise Parent
of the terms of such Superior Proposal, and will not enter into any commitments
with respect to such Superior Proposal unless, within two Business Days of
providing Parent with the terms of such Superior Proposal, Parent does not
deliver to the Board or any committee thereof a written offer to amend the terms
of this Agreement to provide for terms and conditions (including the amount and
value of consideration hereunder) which are reasonably

                                      A-21

<PAGE>

determined by the Board or any committee thereof to be, when taken in their
entirety, as favorable to Cascade as the Superior Proposal.

        (c)  Upon compliance with the foregoing, following receipt of a Superior
Proposal, the Board shall be entitled to withdraw, modify or refrain from making
its recommendation referred to in Section 6.1(a) and approve and recommend to
the shareholders of Cascade a Superior Proposal, and Cascade shall be entitled
to enter into an agreement with such third party concerning a Superior Proposal.

        (d)  Cascade shall be entitled to provide copies of this Section 6.5 to
third parties who, on an unsolicited basis after the date of this Agreement,
contact Cascade regarding an Acquisition Proposal.

    6.6  PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.  The Parent and Cascade will consult with one
another before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation
without the consent of the Parent and Cascade, except based on the advice of
counsel for Cascade or the Parent, as the case may be, as required by Applicable
Law.

    6.7  CONSENT OF THE PARENT.  The Parent, as the sole shareholder of
Acquisition Co., by executing this Agreement hereby consents to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Acquisition Co. and such consent
shall be treated for all purposes as a vote duly adopted at a meeting of the
shareholders of Acquisition Co. held for such purpose.

    6.8  TRANSFER TAXES.

        (a)  Except as provided in Section 3.5(c), the Parent shall be
responsible for the payment of, and shall indemnify the Cascade shareholders
against, all Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with or attributable
to the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement.

        (b)  As between the Cascade shareholders, on the one hand, and the
Parent, on the other hand, the party that has the primary responsibility under
Applicable Law for filing any Tax return required to be filed in respect of
Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax return, PROVIDED HOWEVER,
that such party's preparation of such Tax return shall be subject to the other
party's approval, which approval shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably.

    6.9  INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS; OFFICERS' AND DIRECTORS'
INSURANCE.  The Parent agrees that for the entire period from the Effective Time
until at least six (6) years after the Effective Time (a) the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the
provisions with respect to indemnification (including advancement of expenses)
and exculpation from liability set forth in Cascade's Restated Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, as amended as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified during such
period in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
employees or agents of Cascade unless such modification is required by
Applicable Law and (b) the Surviving Corporation shall either (x) maintain in
effect Cascade's current directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered on the date of this Agreement by
Cascade's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or (y) purchase an
extended coverage or "tail" insurance policy having a policy limit equal to or
greater than the aggregate policy limit of such insurance and covering such
persons against claims made within six (6) years following the Effective Time,
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay in order
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this paragraph an amount
per year in excess of 250% of the aggregate premiums paid by Cascade for the
policy period ending November 20, 2000 (exclusive of excess coverage obtained in
2000) for directors' and officers'

                                      A-22

<PAGE>

liability insurance (and shall timely notify Cascade's former officers and
directors of any lapse in coverage).

    6.10  NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.  Parent and Acquisition Co. shall
give prompt notice to Cascade and Cascade shall give prompt notice to Parent, of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure
to occur would be likely to cause (a) any representation or warranty of Cascade
or of Parent and Acquisition Co. contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of Parent and Acquisition Co.
or Cascade, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent
thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

    6.11  ACCESS TO INFORMATION.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and
upon reasonable notice, Cascade shall (and shall cause each Cascade Subsidiary
to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financing sources
and other representatives of Parent, access, during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, Cascade shall (and
shall cause each Cascade Subsidiary to) furnish promptly to the Parent (a) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal
securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the Parent may reasonably request. Access shall
include the right to conduct such management information systems, risk
management and environmental studies as Parent shall reasonably deem
appropriate.

of competent jurisdiction or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and such order,

abandoned, without further action by any of the parties hereto, except that the

termination, and Parent or Acquisition Co. shall return to Cascade all

with the transactions contemplated hereby. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, no party hereto shall have any liability or further obligation
to any other party to this Agreement except as provided in this Section 10.2 and
in Section 10.3; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, any termination shall be without prejudice
to the rights of any party hereto arising out of a breach by any other party of
