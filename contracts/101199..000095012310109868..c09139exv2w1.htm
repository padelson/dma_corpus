and without any action on the part of Mercer, Buyer, Acquisition Corp. or the
holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(b) _Mercer Common Stock_. 

  

(i) Each share of Mercer Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.6(b)(ii)), including any allocated and unallocated shares held by
the Mercer ESOP, and any shares of restricted stock, shall become and be a
right to receive in cash $28.25 (the "Cash Consideration"). Each such
share, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of each
such share upon the surrender of all certificates that formerly represented
shares of Mercer Common Stock ("Certificates") held by such holder in
accordance with Section 2.7. 

  

(ii) Each share of Mercer Common Stock held in the treasury of Mercer or by

(i) Each Mercer Stock Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

Stock that would have been acquired upon the exercise of such Mercer Stock
Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over
the exercise price to acquire a share of Mercer Common Stock under such
Mercer Stock Option (the "Option Consideration"), subject to any applicable
withholding taxes; _provided_ , that if the exercise price per share
under any such Mercer Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Cash
Consideration, then such Mercer Stock Option shall be cancelled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each share of restricted stock granted under the
Mercer Option Plan shall become fully vested and shall be treated as an
issued and outstanding share of Mercer Common Stock under Section 2.6(b). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(ii) Effective at the Effective Time, the Mercer Option Plan and all awards
thereunder shall terminate, and all rights under any provision of any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other

Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary shall be cancelled, without any liability on
the part of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary (except as otherwise expressly

pay the holders of Mercer Stock Options the cash payments specified in this
Section 2.6(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on cash payments to
holders of Mercer Stock Options. Mercer shall cooperate with Buyer, and keep
Buyer fully informed, with respect to all resolutions, actions and consents
that Mercer intends to adopt, take and obtain in connection with the matters
described in this Section 2.6. Without limiting the foregoing, Mercer shall
provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such
resolutions and consents and shall not undertake any obligation in connection
with any such resolution, action or consent without the prior written consent
of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. 

   

2.7 _Exchange of Shares_. 

  

(a) _Surrender and Cancellation_. At the Effective Time, Buyer will deliver
or cause to be delivered to a third-party agent to be appointed by Buyer and
reasonably acceptable to Mercer (the "Exchange Agent") an amount equal to the
aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and will
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent or Mercers
payroll provider an amount equal to the aggregate Option Consideration to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.6(c). Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to, as
promptly as practical after the Effective Time, but in no event later than
ten (10) days after the Closing Date, send or cause to be sent to each former
holder of record of Mercer Common Stock transmittal materials (the "Letter
of Transmittal") for use in exchanging their Certificates for the
consideration provided in this Agreement. The Letter of Transmittal will
contain instructions with respect to the surrender of Certificates and the
receipt of the Cash Consideration contemplated by Section 2.6(b).
Upon surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of any Certificates
held by any Mercer shareholder, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed, the Exchange Agent shall pay to such Mercer shareholder the Cash
Consideration with respect to such Certificates. No interest will be paid or
accrued for the benefit of any Mercer shareholder on the amount payable upon
the surrender of any Certificates held by such shareholder. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.7, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Cash Consideration contemplated by Section 2.6(b). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Mercer shareholder to Buyer claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as Buyer or the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to such Certificate, Buyer will pay or cause to be paid in exchange
for each share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Cash Consideration. 

  

(c) _Withholding_ _._ Buyer and the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions to any Person such amounts as
Buyer or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision
of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such
amounts are properly withheld by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made by Buyer or the Exchange Agent. 

  

(d) _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the six (6) month period
after the Effective Time, Buyer shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it any portions of the aggregate Cash Consideration and
aggregate Option Consideration that had been made available to the Exchange
Agent and not disbursed to holders of Mercer Common Stock or Mercer
Stock Options (including, all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Cash Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of any Certificates
held by them or any Option Consideration that may be payable to them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any former holder of Mercer Common Stock or Mercer Stock
Options for any Cash Consideration or Option Consideration delivered in
respect of such shares to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law. 

  

(e) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Mercer shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Mercer of Mercer Common Stock thereafter other
than to settle transfers of Mercer Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
for transfer to Buyer or the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the
Cash Consideration and cancelled as provided in this Section 2.7. 

  

2.8 _Payment of Option Consideration_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall pay to the record holder of any Mercer Stock Options who is
an employee or former employee of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary an amount
equal to the Option Consideration to which such holder of Mercer
Stock Options is entitled under Section 2.6(c). Provided that if funds
are deposited by Buyer with Mercers payroll provider, such payment shall be
made by Mercer pursuant to its payroll process. With respect to any Mercer
Stock Options held by any Person who is not an employee or former employee of
Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary, as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall send, by United States first
class mail a check for the Option Consideration to which such holder of
Mercer Stock Options is entitled under Section 2.6(c). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Mercer Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender for exchange of any Certificates in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Mercer Common Stock represented by such
Certificates. 

  

2.10 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares of Mercer Common Stock shall be
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of
shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares,
(b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities of Mercer
shall be declared with a record date within such period, or (c) any similar
event shall have occurred, then the Cash Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Mercer Common Stock (and Mercer Stock
Options) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. 

  

2.11 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,

things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm
the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of Mercer or

Except as otherwise disclosed to Buyer in the Mercer Disclosure Schedule (the

and warranties contained in this Article III to which the information in such
schedules relates), Mercer represents and warrants to Buyer as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows: 

  

3.1 _Organization_. Mercer is a Pennsylvania corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, and has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
governmental approvals necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Mercer is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
held under lease or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The
copies of Mercers Constituent Documents that have been made available to
Buyer are complete and correct and in full force and effect. 

   

3.2 _Capitalization_. 

  

(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Mercer consists of

of preferred stock, of which, no shares are issued and outstanding. As of the
date hereof, the Mercer ESOP is the record owner of 605,986 shares of Mercer
Common Stock, of which 418,153 shares have been allocated to and are
beneficially owned by, participants in the Mercer ESOP and 187,833 shares have
not been so allocated and are held in a suspense account. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of Mercer Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. None of the outstanding
shares of Mercer Common Stock were issued in violation of any Applicable Laws
or Mercers or any of the Mercer Subsidiaries respective Constituent
Documents or any Contract. There are no capital appreciation rights, phantom
stock plans, securities with participation rights or features, or similar
obligations or commitments of Mercer or any of the Mercer
Subsidiaries. Mercer does not have any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the shareholders of Mercer on any matter. Other than the Shareholder
Support Agreements, there are no Contracts to which Mercer, any of the Mercer
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors is a party
concerning the voting of any capital stock of Mercer or any of the Mercer
Subsidiaries. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) An aggregate of 538,800 shares of Mercer Common Stock are reserved for
issuance pursuant to outstanding options (the "Mercer Stock Options") to
purchase shares of Mercer Common Stock pursuant to the Mercer Option Plan.
The Mercer Option Plan is the only benefit plan of Mercer and the Mercer
Subsidiaries under which any securities of Mercer or any of the Mercer
Subsidiaries are issuable. Each share of Mercer Common Stock which may be
issued pursuant to the Mercer Stock Options has been duly authorized and, if
and when issued pursuant to the terms thereof, will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth
in Section 3.2(a) and this Section 3.2(b), no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Mercer are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. 

  

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following
information with respect to each Mercer Stock Option outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement: (i) the Plan pursuant to which such Mercer Stock
Option was granted; (ii) the name of the holder of such Mercer Stock Option;
(iii) the number of shares of Mercer Common Stock subject to such Mercer
Stock Option; (iv) the exercise price of such Mercer Stock Option; (v) the
date on which such Mercer Stock Option was granted; (vi) the extent to which
such Mercer Stock Option is vested and exercisable as of the date of this
Agreement and the times and extent to which such Mercer Stock Option is
scheduled to become vested and exercisable after the date of this Agreement;
and (vii) the date on which such Mercer Stock Option expires. Other than the
Mercer Stock Options, no other Rights or other equity-based awards are
outstanding. Since September 30, 2010, except as permitted in accordance with
Section 5.1 of this Agreement, Mercer has not (A) issued or repurchased
any shares of Mercer Common Stock, preferred stock, other equity securities
of Mercer or other securities convertible into equity securities of Mercer or
any of the Mercer Subsidiaries, other than the issuance of shares of Mercer
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of Mercer Stock Options, or (B)
issued or awarded any options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
shares, restricted stock units, deferred equity units, awards based on the

3.4 _Mercer Subsidiaries_.

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization and has the corporate or other
organizational power and authority and all government approvals necessary to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. Each Mercer Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.4(a) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
correct list of the Subsidiaries of Mercer other than the Mercer Insurance
Subsidiaries, and sets forth for each such Subsidiary, (i) the name of such
Subsidiary, (ii) the state or jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization, (iii) each state or jurisdiction in which it is qualified or
licensed to do business, and (iv) the record owner of its shares, other
equity interests and any other securities convertible into equity interests
(except for the holders of the preferred securities of the Statutory Trusts).
Other than the Subsidiaries listed in Sections 3.4(a) and 3.4(b) of the
Mercer Disclosure Schedule, Mercer does not, directly or indirectly, have the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of any
Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by Contract or
otherwise.  

  

    ##### 

  

     

(b) Each Mercer Insurance Subsidiary is an insurance company (i) duly licensed
or authorized as an insurance company in its jurisdiction of incorporation,
and (ii) duly licensed or authorized to carry on an insurance business in
each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized,
except, in each case, where such failure to be licensed or authorized would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Mercer
conducts all of its insurance operations that are required to be conducted
through a licensed insurance company or insurance intermediary, through a
Mercer Insurance Subsidiary. Section 3.4(b) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule
lists for each Mercer Insurance Subsidiary (A) the name of such Mercer
Insurance Subsidiary, (B) the state or jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, (C) each jurisdiction in which it is licensed or authorized to
carry on an insurance business, (D) the types of insurance and other products
it is licensed to write in each jurisdiction in which it is licensed or
authorized to carry on an insurance business, and (E) the record owner of its
shares, other equity interests and any other securities convertible into
equity interests. None of Mercers Insurance Subsidiaries are "commercially
domiciled" under the laws of any jurisdiction or is otherwise treated as
domiciled in a jurisdiction other than its respective jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization. 

  

(c) Except for the preferred securities of the Statutory Trusts, Mercer is,
directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of all of the
outstanding shares or other equity interests of each of the Mercer
Subsidiaries, there are no proxies with respect to any such shares or equity
interests, and no equity securities of any Mercer Subsidiary are or may become
required to be issued by reason of any Rights. All of such shares or equity
interests so owned by Mercer are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned by it free and clear of any Encumbrance.

Mercer other than obtaining shareholder approval are necessary to authorize

to contest payment. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) There are no unpaid claims or assessments made against any Mercer
Insurance Subsidiary, whether or not due, by any insurance guaranty
association (in connection with that associations fund relating to insolvent
insurers), joint underwriting association, residual market facility
or assigned risk pool. To the Knowledge of Mercer, no such material claim or
assessment is pending and none of the Mercer Insurance Subsidiaries have
received written notice of any such material claim or assessment against it
by any insurance guaranty association, joint underwriting association,
residual market facility or assigned risk pool. 

  

(c) All policies, binders, slips, certificates and other agreements of
insurance in effect as of the date hereof (including all applications,
endorsements, supplements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection
therewith) issued by any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary, and any and
all marketing materials, agent agreements, broker agreements, service
contracts, and managing general agent agreements to which Mercer or any
Mercer Subsidiary is a party, are, to the extent required under Applicable
Law, on forms approved by the Insurance Regulators or have been filed with and
not objected to by such Insurance Regulators within the period provided for
objection, and all of such forms comply with the Insurance Laws in all
material respects. As to premium rates established by any Mercer Insurance
Subsidiary, which are required to be filed with or approved by any
Insurance Regulators, the rates have been so filed or approved, the premiums
charged conform thereto, and such premiums comply with the Insurance Laws.
Section 3.19(c) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule sets forth all increases in
premium rates submitted by the Mercer Insurance Subsidiaries which have been
disapproved by any Insurance Regulator since December 31, 2007. Section
3.19(c) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule lists all correspondence or

Subsidiary after December 31, 2007, that requests or suggests that its
premium rates, if applicable, should be reduced below the current approved

(d) No Mercer Insurance Subsidiary has issued any participating policies or
any retrospectively rated policies of insurance. 

   

3.20 _Reinsurance Treaties_. 

  

(a) All reinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional
agreements, to which any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under
which any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or
liabilities are listed in Section 3.20(a) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule
(the "Mercer Reinsurance Treaties"). Mercer has made available to Buyer
correct and complete copies of all of the Mercer Reinsurance Treaties and all
such Mercer Reinsurance Treaties are in full force and effect, and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not result in a violation
or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or result
in the loss of any benefit) under, any of the terms, conditions, or
provisions of any Mercer Reinsurance Treaty. The Mercer GAAP Reserves (as
defined 

  

    ##### 

  

   

in Section 3.21(a) of this Agreement) at each of December 31, 2008, December
31, 2009, and September 30, 2010, as reflected in the Mercer Financial
Statements are stated without taking credit for amounts ceded under any
reinsurance treaties or agreements, and the Mercer SAP Reserves (as defined
in Section 3.21(b) of this Agreement) at each of December 31, 2008, December
31, 2009, and September 30, 2010, as reflected in the Mercer Statutory
Financial Statements, in each case, are stated taking credit for amounts
ceded under any reinsurance treaties or agreements. Mercer has reasonably
concluded that all reinsurance recoverable amounts reflected in the Mercer
Financial Statements are collectible, and Mercer is unaware of any material
adverse change in the financial condition of Mercers reinsurers that might
raise concern regarding their ability to honor their reinsurance commitments.
No party to any of the Mercer Reinsurance Treaties has given notice to Mercer
or any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary that such party intends to terminate,
cancel or alter the pricing of any of the Mercer Reinsurance Treaties as a
result of or following consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Each
Mercer Reinsurance Treaty is valid and binding on each party thereto. With
respect to each Mercer Reinsurance Treaty, there is no material default or
claim of any material default thereunder by any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary
that is a party thereto or, to the Knowledge of Mercer, by any other party
thereto, and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the
giving of notice (or both), would constitute a material default thereunder by
any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary, that is a party thereto or, to the Knowledge
of Mercer, by any other party thereto, or would permit material modification,
acceleration or termination thereof. No Mercer Reinsurance Treaty contains
any provision providing that the other party thereto may terminate or alter
the pricing of the same by reason of the Contemplated Transactions, or
contains any other provision which would be altered or otherwise become
applicable by reason of such transactions. Since January 1, 2007, no Mercer
Reinsurance Treaty has been cancelled. Since January 1, 2007, there have been
no disputes under any Mercer Reinsurance Treaty other than disputes in the
ordinary course for which adequate loss reserves have been established. 

  

(b) Other than the Reinsurance Pooling Agreement, none of the Mercer Insurance
Subsidiaries is a party to any reinsurance pools or fronting arrangements
under which any obligations remain outstanding. 

   

3.21 _Reserves_.

assets under the Insurance Laws in an amount at least equal to the sum of all
its reserves and liability amounts and its minimum statutory capital and
surplus as required by such Insurance Laws. The Mercer Financial Statements,
as of the date thereof, set forth all of the reserves of such Mercer
Insurance Subsidiary as of such date (collectively, the "Mercer GAAP
Reserves"). The Mercer GAAP Reserves (i) were determined in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied, (ii) were computed on the basis of methodologies
consistent in all material respects with those used in prior periods, (iii)
were fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with sound
actuarial principles, (iv) were established in accordance with prudent

satisfied the requirements of all Applicable Laws in all material respects. 

  

(b) The Mercer Statutory Financial Statements, as of the date thereof, set
forth all of the reserves of such Mercer Insurance Subsidiary as of such date
(collectively, the "Mercer SAP Reserves"). The Mercer SAP Reserves, net of
the reinsurance thereof, (i) were determined in accordance with SAP
consistently applied, (ii) were computed on the basis of methodologies
consistent in all material respects with those used in prior periods, (iii)
were fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with sound
actuarial principles, (iv) were established in accordance with prudent
insurance practices generally followed in the insurance industry, and (v)
satisfied the requirements of all Applicable Laws in all material respects.

independent or otherwise, that has reviewed, on behalf of Mercer or any
Mercer Subsidiary, the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of
Mercer or such Mercer Subsidiary and/or its premium rates for liability
insurance in each of the years commencing after December 31, 2006
(collectively the "Mercer Actuaries" and separately a "Mercer Actuary").
Section 3.21(c) of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule lists each and every
actuarial report, and all attachments, supplements, addenda and modifications
thereto prepared for or on behalf of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary by the
Mercer Actuaries, or delivered by the Mercer Actuaries to Mercer or any
Mercer Subsidiary, since December 31, 2006, in which a Mercer Actuary has (i)
either expressed an opinion on the adequacy of the Mercer GAAP Reserves or
the Mercer SAP Reserves, or (ii) expressed an opinion as to the adequacy
of such premiums or made a recommendation as to the premiums that should be
charged by a Mercer Insurance Subsidiary (collectively, the "Mercer Actuarial
Analyses"). Mercer has made available to Buyer a true and complete copy of
each of the Mercer Actuarial Analyses. The information and data furnished by
Mercer and the Mercer Insurance Subsidiaries and their Affiliates in
connection with the preparation of the Mercer Actuarial Analyses, as well as
the actuarial information provided to Buyer, was complete and accurate in all
material respects.

Reinsurance Treaties for which any Mercer Insurance Subsidiary is taking

any Mercer Statutory Financial Statement from and after January 1, 2008, (a)
there are no separate written or oral agreements between Mercer or any
Mercer Insurance Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the assuming reinsurer, on
the other hand, that would under any circumstances, reduce, limit, mitigate
or otherwise affect any actual or potential loss to the parties under any
such Mercer Reinsurance Treaty, other than inuring contracts that
are explicitly defined in any such Mercer Reinsurance Treaty, (b) for each
such Mercer Reinsurance Treaty entered into, renewed, or amended on or after
January 1, 2008, for which risk transfer is not reasonably considered to be
self-evident, documentation concerning the economic intent of the transaction
and the risk transfer analysis evidencing the proper accounting treatment, as
required by Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles ("SSAP") No. 62, is
available for review by the Insurance Regulators, (c) each of the Mercer
Insurance Subsidiaries complies and has complied from and after January 1,
2008 with all the requirements set forth in SSAP No. 62, and (d) each of
the Mercer Insurance Subsidiaries has and has had from and after January 1,
2008 appropriate controls in place to monitor the use of reinsurance and
adhere to the provisions of SSAP No. 62\. None of the Mercer Insurance
Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of Mercer, any counterparty to an
insurance contract or Mercer Reinsurance Treaty with any Mercer Insurance
Subsidiary, has accounted at any time for risks ceded or assumed as
reinsurance under SAP and as a deposit under GAAP, or as reinsurance under
GAAP and as a deposit under SAP.

independent accountants, if available and subject to the consent of such
independent accountants), properties, plants and personnel and, during
such period, Mercer shall furnish as promptly as practicable to Buyer all
information as Buyer reasonably may request; _provided_ , no investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect any representations or warranties
made herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions. Mercer and Buyer agree to schedule and convene
meetings of officers, Producers and employees at reasonable intervals to
discuss Mercer and Buyer business developments, status of efforts related to
the Closing and other matters of mutual interest. Each party shall continue
to abide by the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between Mercer and
Buyer, dated October 19, 2010 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mercer shall not be required to

indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal, as defined below, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or agree to or endorse, or take any other action
to facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of

Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the Mercer Recommendation, (iv) approve
or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
or (v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principal or
Contract providing for, relating to or in connection with, any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Mercer
Shareholder Meeting, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Mercer
or its Board of Directors from taking any of the actions described in clauses

Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party, if, only to the extent that and only
so long as, (A) such Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a
Superior Proposal, as defined below, and, in the reasonable good
faith judgment of Mercers Board of Directors, following consultation with
its independent financial advisors, the Third Party making such Superior
Proposal has the financial means to conclude such transaction, (B) the
failure to take such action would in the reasonable good faith judgment
of Mercers Board of Directors, after consultation with Mercers outside
corporate counsel, violate the fiduciary duties of Mercers Board of
Directors under Applicable Law, (C) prior to furnishing such non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Third Party, Mercers Board of Directors receives from such Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement with provisions not less favorable to
Mercer than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (D) Mercer
shall have provided Buyer all materials and information required
under Section 5.4(c) to be delivered by Mercer to Buyer and shall have fully
complied with this Section 5.4; _provided_ , _further_ , that immediately
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Mercer will cease and
terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third
Parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal. Mercer agrees that following its receipt of a Superior Proposal and
its full compliance with Section 5.4(c), Buyer shall have a reasonable
opportunity, but in no event more than five (5) days, to propose changes to
this Agreement in response to such proposal. 

  

(b) Mercer shall promptly cease and terminate all activities, discussions and
negotiations with any Third Party permitted pursuant to Section 5.4(a) and
promptly reaffirm the Mercer Recommendation if at any time any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of Section 5.4(a) shall fail to
be satisfied, including if, as a result of any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Buyer, such Acquisition Proposal would thereafter fail
to result in a Superior Proposal. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Mercer shall
promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after it receives
any Acquisition Proposal, or any written request for information regarding
Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary by a Third Party that has made or is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal which
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or any
indication that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal

Proposal, advise Buyer orally and in writing of the receipt of
such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry or indication, including
providing the identity of the Third Party making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal or request, and (i) if it is in writing, a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements and other written
material setting forth the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) if oral, a reasonably detailed written summary thereof.
Mercer will keep Buyer fully informed of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry or indication or with respect to
any change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request,
inquiry or indication. Mercer agrees that, subject to restrictions under
Applicable Laws, it shall, prior to or concurrent with the time it is
provided to any Third Parties, provide to Buyer any non-public
information concerning Mercer and any Mercer Subsidiary that Mercer provides
to any Third Party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not
previously provided to Buyer. 

  

(d) The term "Acquisition Transaction" as used herein means any transaction or
series of related transactions other than the Merger involving: (i) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase by a Third Party of more than a
fifteen percent (15%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of

that if consummated would result in any Third Party beneficially owning
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total outstanding voting securities of
Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary; (iii) any merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary pursuant to
which the shareholders of Mercer immediately preceding such transaction hold
less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the equity interests in the surviving
or resulting entity of such transaction in substantially the same proportion
as prior to such transaction; (iv) any direct or indirect sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition, including through
any bulk reinsurance, reinsurance, coinsurance or similar transaction, of
more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets (based on the fair market value
thereof) of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary; or (v) any liquidation

or proposal by a Third Party relating to any Acquisition Transaction. 

  

(f) The term "Superior Proposal" as used herein means any unsolicited bona

national reputation and Mercers outside legal counsel, taking into account
relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the
identity of the Third Party making such proposal and the conditions for
completion of such proposal, including any proposed financing conditions, (i)
is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Mercers shareholders
than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Buyer in response to such proposal or otherwise), and
(ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set forth in the
proposal within a substantially similar period of time as the period of time
reasonably expected to be necessary to consummate the Merger. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(g) The term "Third Party" as used herein means any Person or group (as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder) other than Buyer and its Affiliates. 

  

5.5 _Third Party Standstill Agreements_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, Mercer shall not nor shall it
permit any Mercer Subsidiary to, terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or standstill agreement to which Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary is a
party (other than any involving Buyer). During such period, Mercer agrees to
and to cause any Mercer Subsidiary to, enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreements,
including obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and

cause to be taken, all other action and do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary or appropriate to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject
to the terms and conditions herein provided, within thirty (30) days after
the date hereof, Buyer, with the assistance of Mercer, shall make Form A and
all related filings required by the Insurance Regulators in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and California, and any other relevant jurisdiction, each as
reasonably may be required to be made in connection with this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions. Each party agrees to promptly supply
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested

jurisdictions. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Body, each of Mercer and Buyer shall promptly notify the other
parties to this Agreement of any material communication it receives from any
Governmental Body relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and shall permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
material communication by such party to any Governmental Body (other than its

with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as such parties may reasonably request in connection with their respective
obligations under this _Section 5.6_, including in seeking early termination
of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither party shall be required to take any action under this

a third party or disclosure of sensitive commercial information. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to divest or hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, Mercer or any of
the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer, Mercer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or that otherwise would,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a material negative impact on the
business, assets, liabilities, properties or condition (financial or
otherwise) of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Mercer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) Mercer shall not, without
Buyers prior written consent, take or agree to take any such action. 

   

5.7 _Public Announcements; Public Disclosures; Privacy Laws_. 

  

(a) Until the Closing Date, Mercer and Buyer agree that they will not issue
any press release or otherwise make any public statement, make any public
filing or any submission to any rating agency or respond to any press inquiry
in each case with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
without the prior approval of the other party, except as (i)
expressly authorized by the terms of this Agreement, (ii) may be required by
Applicable Law, or (iii) may be required pursuant to the terms of any listing
agreement with NASDAQ. 

  

(b) Each of Mercer and Buyer will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the
performance by the parties of their obligations under this Agreement will not
result in any breach of (i) any Applicable Law concerning the protection of
confidential personal information received from individual policyholders, or
(ii) the privacy policies of Buyer or Mercer. 

  

(c) Any formal employee communication programs or announcements by Mercer with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions or the employment or benefit
arrangements to be effective following the Effective Time shall be subject to

5.8 _Indemnification Provisions_. 

  

(a) Buyer shall indemnify present and former directors, officers and employees
of Mercer and each Mercer Subsidiary, including any person appointed by
Mercer to serve in a fiduciary capacity for any employee benefit plan
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") for all losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, including entry into
this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, to the
same extent such Indemnified Parties are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by Mercer or the applicable Mercer Subsidiary pursuant to their
respective Constituent Documents for acts and omissions occurring at or prior
to the Closing Date, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Closing Date. 

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by Mercer ("DandO Insurance") with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that: 

  

(i) Buyer may substitute policies of substantially similar coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous or
provide tail coverage for such persons covered by the DandO Insurance, which
tail coverage shall provide coverage for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date for acts taken prior to the Closing Date on terms no less
favorable than the terms of such current DandO Insurance coverage; 

  

(ii) in the event Buyer is unable to maintain in effect the current DandO
Insurance policies and substantially similar insurance coverage is
unavailable, Buyer shall, subject to Section 5.8(b)(iii), provide the best
available coverage; and 

  

(iii) nothing contained herein shall require Buyer to incur any annual premium
in excess of 200% of the last annual estimated aggregate premium paid prior
to the date of this Agreement for all current DandO Insurance policies
maintained by Mercer, which Mercer estimates to be $118,835 (the "Current
Premium"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
200% of the Current Premium, then Buyer shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance which, in Buyers good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 200% of the Current
Premium. 

  

(c) If Buyer or any of its Affiliates (i) shall consolidate with or merge into
any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns.

5.9 _Additional Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, including Section 5.6(c), each of the parties hereto agrees to use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Contemplated
Transactions, including using all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary waivers, consents and approvals from any Governmental Body and
any other third party consents and to effect all necessary registrations and
filings. In case at any time after the Closing Date any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of Buyer, Acquisition Corp. and Mercer
shall, subject to Section 5.6(c), take all such necessary action. 

   

5.10 _Employee Matters_. 

  

(a) After the Closing Date, the Mercer Plans may, at Buyers election and
subject to the requirements of the Code and ERISA, continue to be maintained
separately, consolidated, merged, frozen or terminated. Employees of Mercer
or any Mercer Subsidiary who become participants in a Buyer benefit plan
shall, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in such plans
and vesting purposes under such plans , be given credit for service as an
employee of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary (and any predecessor thereto)
prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit
the ability of Buyer to review employee benefits programs from time to time
and to make such changes (including terminating any program) as it deems
appropriate. 

  

(b) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Mercer and
each Mercer Subsidiary, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, the
"Mercer 401(k) Plans") (unless Buyer provides written notice to Mercer at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such Mercer
401(k) Plans shall not be terminated). Unless Buyer provides such written
notice to Mercer, then not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date Mercer shall provide Buyer with evidence that such Mercer 401(k)
Plans have been terminated, effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, pursuant to resolutions of Mercers Board of Directors. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Buyer. Mercer shall also take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such Mercer 401(k) Plans as Buyer may reasonably require. 

  

(c) For the one-year period following the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide
employees employed by Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary at the Closing Date
that are not a party to a written employment agreement with Mercer or any
Mercer Subsidiary that is in force on the date hereof, and for so long as
they remain employed during such period, with not less than the same base
salary, wages or commission rates as in effect immediately before the Closing
Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) In the event of any termination or consolidation of any Mercer health plan
with any Buyer health plan, Buyer shall make available to employees of Mercer
or any Mercer Subsidiary who continue employment with Buyer ("Continuing
Employees") and their dependents health coverage on the same basis as it
provides such coverage to similarly situated employees of Buyer. Unless
a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a Mercer
health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible
to participate in the Buyer health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the Mercer health
plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become
eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to
similarly situated employees of Buyer and their dependents. In the event of
a termination or consolidation of any Mercer health plan, terminated Mercer
employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continuation
coverage under group health plans of Buyer in accordance with COBRA and/or
other Applicable Law. With respect to any Continuing Employee, any coverage
limitation under the Buyer health plan due to any pre-existing condition shall
be waived by the Buyer health plan to the degree that such condition was
covered by the Mercer health plan and such condition would otherwise have
been covered by the Buyer health plan in the absence of such coverage
limitation. Buyer shall cause the applicable Buyer benefit plan to recognize
any medical or other health expense incurred by a Continuing Employee in the
plan year that includes the commencement of coverage under such Buyer plan
for purposes of determining any applicable deductible and annual out of
pocket expense thereunder. 

  

(e) Buyer shall assume the obligations of Mercer and any Mercer Subsidiary
under the employment agreements and change in control agreements listed in
Section 3.20 of the Mercer Disclosure Schedule. 

  

(f) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, any employee of
Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary whose employment is involuntarily terminated
(other than for cause but including any termination of employment following a
reduction in compensation or benefits or a requested relocation to more than
25 miles from such employees current principal office) shall be entitled to
severance benefits equal to the greater of: (i) any severance benefits payable
under the severance plan of the Buyer for similarly situated employees of the
Buyer, or (ii) two weeks pay per year of service, with a minimum of one month
pay and a maximum of one year. In addition, any payment of severance benefits
hereunder to any employee of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary will include
payment for any earned but unused vacation, sick or other paid time off. In no
event will any severance benefit be paid for any termination where such
termination is the result in whole or in part of any disciplinary action with
respect to the employee, a violation of Buyer or Mercer policy by the
employee, or other issue related to the job performance of the
employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.10(f) shall not be
applicable to any employee of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary that is party
to a written employment agreement with Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary. 

  

(g) As of the Closing Date, each employee of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary
shall be entitled to the same number of vacation, sick or other paid time off
days and holidays to which such employee was entitled under the policies of
Mercer in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(h) As of the date that this Agreement shall have been approved and adopted by
the requisite vote of the shareholders of Mercer in accordance with
Applicable Law, the Mercer ESOP shall be terminated. As soon as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement, Mercer shall file all necessary
documents with the IRS for a favorable determination letter for the
termination of the Mercer ESOP. As soon as practicable after the receipt of
a favorable determination letter on termination from IRS, the account
balances in the Mercer ESOP, including any surplus in the suspense account
after full payment of the Mercer ESOP loan and all Mercer ESOP administrative
expenses, shall be distributed to participants and beneficiaries
in accordance with the provisions of the Code and Applicable Law and the
terms of the Mercer ESOP. Prior to the Closing Date, contributions to, and
payments on the Mercer ESOP loan shall be made consistent with past practices
on the regularly scheduled payment dates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Mercer shall make a contribution to, and payment on, the Mercer ESOP
loan with respect to the period from January 1, 2010 through the Closing
Date. 

  

(i) As of the Closing Date, all benefits under the Mercer Insurance Group,
Inc. Benefits Agreements I and II (the "Director Deferred Compensation
Agreements") shall become fully vested and such benefits shall be paid in a
lump sum by the Surviving Corporation within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Director Deferred
Compensation Agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

(j) Subject to the provisions of any existing employment Contracts, nothing
herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Continuing
Employee or any other employee of Mercer or any Mercer Subsidiary, or to
restrict the right of Buyer, Mercer or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
to terminate or cause to be terminated any employee at any time for any or no
reason with or without notice. Nothing contained herein, whether expressed or
implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Plan, any plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement or the establishment of any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, or (ii) shall limit the right
of Buyer, Mercer or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, terminate
or otherwise modify (or cause to be amended, terminated or otherwise
modified) any Plan, plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other employment benefit plan, program or arrangement following the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms. Buyer and Mercer acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in this Section 5.10 are included for the
sole benefit of Buyer, Mercer and their respective Subsidiaries, and that
nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of Buyer, Mercer or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, or (B) to continued employment with Buyer,
Mercer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or continued participation in
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement. 

  

5.11 _Advice of Changes_. Mercer and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the
other party as soon as practicable after it has actual knowledge of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which would or would be likely
to cause any partys representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from
the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, (b) any failure on its part
or on the part of any of its or its Subsidiaries officers, directors,
employees, representatives or agents (other than persons or entities who are
such employees, representatives or agents only because they are appointed
insurance agents of such parties) to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by such party under this Agreement, or (c) any change, event or effect which
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Mercer will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct and
supplement the information set forth in the Mercer Disclosure Schedule in
order to cause such Mercer Disclosure Schedule to remain correct and complete
in all material respects. Mercers delivery to Buyer of any corrections or
supplements will, without further notice or action on the part of Mercer
or Buyer, immediately and automatically constitute an amendment to the Mercer
Disclosure Schedule to which such corrections and supplements relate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that solely for purposes of determining whether the
condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.3(a) has been satisfied, or
whether Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections
7.2(d), any such amendment to the Mercer Disclosure Schedule will be
disregarded. Mercer shall update the Mercer Disclosure Schedule (the "Closing
Date Mercer Disclosure Schedule") to a date that is no earlier than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and no later than seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and shall deliver the Closing Date
Mercer Disclosure Schedule to Buyer not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. 

  

5.12 _Approval Covenant_. Mercer will, as soon as practicable following the
date hereof, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
shareholders (the "Mercer Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of
considering the approval and adoption of this Agreement. Mercer shall, except
to the extent that Mercer has received an Acquisition Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its shareholders approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the "Mercer
Recommendation"), and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit such approval and adoption by its shareholders, and such Board of
Directors or committee thereof shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend
or modify in a manner adverse to Buyer the Mercer Recommendation or its
declaration that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to
and in the best interests of Mercer and its shareholders or resolve or
propose to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding Mercers receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, Mercer agrees to submit this Agreement to its
shareholders for approval and adoption. 

  

5.13 _Proxy Statement_. In connection with the Mercer Shareholder Meeting, as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Mercer shall prepare a
proxy statement which complies as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act (the "Mercer Proxy Statement") and
shall provide a copy of such Mercer Proxy Statement to Buyer for review
and comment prior to filing such Mercer Proxy Statement with the SEC. As
promptly as practical following Mercers receipt of Buyers comments to the
Mercer Proxy Statement, Mercer shall incorporate such comments as it deems
appropriate, after consultation with its counsel, finalize the Mercer Proxy
Statement and file such Mercer Proxy Statement with the SEC. Mercer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Mercer Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC and mailed to its shareholders as promptly as practicable
after its filing with the SEC. Mercer shall inform Buyer of any and all
written and oral comments Mercer receives from the SEC on the
preliminary Mercer Proxy Statement and shall permit the Buyer to review and
comment on any revised versions prior to filing with the SEC and the final
Mercer Proxy Statement prior to Mercer mailing the final Mercer Proxy
Statement to its shareholders. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information relating to Mercer, any of the Mercer Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers or directors should be discovered by Buyer or
Mercer that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Mercer
Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, Mercer shall promptly prepare an amendment or supplement
describing such information and provide a copy of such amendment to Buyer for
review and comment prior to filing such amendment with the SEC. As promptly
as practicable following Mercers receipt of Buyers comments to such
amendment, Mercer shall incorporate such comments as it deems appropriate,
after consultation with its counsel, and file such amendment with the SEC and
disseminate such amendment to its shareholders. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

5.14 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation,
including the provisions of the Pennsylvania Takeover Disclosure Law (70 P.S.
§71 _et seq_.), shall become applicable to any of the Contemplated
Transactions, Buyer and Mercer and their respective Boards of Directors shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Contemplated Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
thereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the Contemplated Transactions. 

  

5.15 _Certain Litigation_. Mercer shall promptly advise Buyer orally and in
writing of any action, suit, claim or other litigation, legal, administrative
or arbitration proceeding or governmental investigation commenced after the
date of this Agreement against Mercer or any of its directors or officers by
any shareholder of Mercer relating to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions and shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, in each case, which if not cured would cause the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, not to be satisfied,
and such breach is incapable of being cured or shall not have been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have been received

recommend approval of this Agreement or the Merger (or if such recommendation
is withdrawn) as a result of the receipt of a Superior Proposal.

and expenses of Buyer that are actually reimbursed by Mercer. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Buyer
receives a payment pursuant to Section 7.5(b) or 7.5(c), such payment will
constitute liquidated damages and be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer

9. _Remedies_. The Shareholder acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it and that any such breach would cause Buyer irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Shareholder agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Buyer, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. 

  

10. _Severability_.

11. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written instrument executed and delivered by both the Shareholder and Buyer. 

  

12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without giving effect to its laws or principles with respect to conflict of laws. 

  

13. _Capitalized Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not defined herein shall have such meanings as set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

14. _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties, this Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

15. _No Limitation on Actions of the Shareholder as Director_. In the event the Shareholder is a director of Mercer, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require the Shareholder to take or in any way limit any action that the Shareholder may take to discharge the Shareholders fiduciary duties as a director of Mercer.

Code as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury regulation §1.409A-1(b)(4),
and for this purpose each payment shall be considered a separate payment. In
the event the terms of this Plan would subject a Participant to taxes or
penalties under Section 409A of the Code ("409A Penalties"), the Company may
amend the terms of this Plan to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent
possible; provided that in no event shall the Company be responsible for any
409A Penalties that arise in connection with any amounts payable under this
