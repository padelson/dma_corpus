receive (without interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time from the
Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the

by (y) the Equity Award Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment. Furthermore, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Equivalent Performance Shares in respect of outstanding
Performance Shares shall vest in the

 



      
 

 



 

same percentage as the Performance Shares underlying such Equivalent
Performance Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_ (and, to the extent the
percentage of the Performance Shares vesting pursuant to this _Section
2.2(c)_ exceeds 100%, additional Equivalent Performance Shares shall be deemed
credited to each holders notional account and vested so that the number of
Equivalent Performance Shares deemed credited to such holders account and
vested is equal to the number that would have been held in such account if the

Shares), and each Equivalent Performance Share shall be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Equivalent Performance Share to receive

deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to
discontinue their participation in the ESPPs in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the ESPPs); and (v) accumulated payroll deductions on such date
shall be used to purchase the applicable number of shares; _provided_ ,

Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPPs, the deductions

Effective Time (without interest). The ESPPs shall terminate immediately
following the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such termination shall be
contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time.

SECTION 2.3 **Surrender of Company Shares**.

 



 

 _Exchange Agent_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed, to act as agent for the shareholders of the Company in connection
with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the shareholders of the Company shall become
entitled in respect of their Company Shares pursuant to this _Article II_.
Parent, Ultimate Parent and Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, (i) at or prior to the Effective Time, a
cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to
provide all funds necessary for the Exchange Agent to make payments of the Per
Share Cash Consideration under _Section 2.1_, (ii) at or prior to the
Effective Time, evidence of shares in book-entry form representing Ultimate
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_, and (iii) from time
to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (such cash and any evidence of shares
in book-entry form representing Ultimate Parent Common Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ")

Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Ultimate
Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Group, a division of McGraw Hill, Inc., respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding one month. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or any cash in the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per
Share Cash Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.1_, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such
investments or other events so as to ensure that the cash in the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under _Section 2.1_ shall be promptly returned to Ultimate Parent, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Ultimate Parent. The funds
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall not
be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of
record of Company Shares (other than holders of Cancelled Shares) (A)
transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in

 



      
 

 



 

customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, with respect to Book-Entry
Shares, only upon delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry
transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), and with respect to
Certificates, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.3(f)_ to the Exchange
Agent), such transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other
provisions as Ultimate Parent, Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.3(f)_) to the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.3(f)_) to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) a cash amount in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.3(e)_) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the number of
Company Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.3(f)_) by (2) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, and such product _plus_ any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and dividends and other distributions such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and (B) the number of
Ultimate Parent Shares, in uncertificated book-entry form, equal to the
product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the number of Company Shares represented
by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in _Section 2.3(f)_) by (2) the Per Share Stock Consideration. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any cash amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates.

 



 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent
of an "agents message" in customary form (it being understood that the
holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Company
Shares upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of such "agents message" or such
other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) be
entitled to receive, and Ultimate Parent and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, (A) a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_)

Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (2) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, and such product _plus_ any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and dividends and other distributions such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and (B) the number of
Ultimate Parent Shares, in uncertificated book-entry form, equal to the
product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the number of Company Shares represented
by such Book-Entry Shares by (2) the Per Share Stock Consideration. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any cash amount payable upon due surrender
of the Book-Entry Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company or if payment and issuance of the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Ultimate Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ are to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is registered, the Ultimate Parent Shares and a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be
issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_, each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
(together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Ultimate Parent Shares, as contemplated by this
_Article II_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
Company Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.6_ and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.5_.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Company
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation, as a general unsecured creditor thereof, for payment and issuance
of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_), any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and any dividends or other distributions such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5_ upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or
acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon in
accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_, and Parent
shall remain liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) payment and issuance of their claim for the Per Share
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Ultimate Parent
Common Stock such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_
and any dividends or other distributions such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Persons entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such unclaimed funds would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person entitled thereto.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share
is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds and the number of Ultimate Parent Shares (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
paid and issued upon the surrender of Certificates (or upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of an "agents message, in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective agents (including the Exchange
Agent), as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Shares, Options, Restricted Stock or Performance Shares such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Ultimate
Parent, Parent or any of their respective agents (including the Exchange
Agent), as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be promptly
remitted by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective agents, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity,
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Shares, Options, Restricted Stock or Performance
Shares, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Ultimate Parent, Parent or
their respective agents, as the case may be.

 



 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will (i) issue a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.3(e)_) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) the
number of Company Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and such product _plus_
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and dividends and
other distributions such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.5_ and (ii) deliver the number of Ultimate Parent Shares, in

 



      
 

 



 

uncertificated book-entry form, equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_
(x) the number of Company Shares represented by such Book-Entry Share by (y)
the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

SECTION 2.4 **Adjustments**. In the event that (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or Ultimate Parent Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or
Ultimate Parent Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a different number of
shares of Company Common Stock or Ultimate Parent Shares, as applicable, or
securities or a different class as a result, in either case, of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other
similar transaction or (ii) any cash dividend is declared or paid by Ultimate
Parent on Ultimate Parent Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time (other than declaration or payment of regular
quarterly cash dividends on Ultimate Parent Shares, not to exceed the amount
set forth on _Section 2.4_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, with usual
record and payment dates for such dividends), in each case the Per Share
Merger Consideration and any other number or amount contained herein which is
based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Ultimate Parent
Shares shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company, any subsidiary of the Company
or any other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.5 **Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares**.

 



 

(a) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Ultimate Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate with respect to the Ultimate
Parent Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Certificate, until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of
Ultimate Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends and other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date prior to such surrender payable with respect to
such Ultimate Parent Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends and other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such Ultimate Parent Shares.

 



 

(b) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to the
holder of the Ultimate Parent Shares issued in exchange for Book-Entry Shares

receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" (or such other evidence,
if any, of surrender as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), the amount
of dividends and other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such receipt and a payment date prior to such receipt
payable with respect to such Ultimate Parent Shares and (ii) at the

SECTION 2.6 **No Fractional Shares of Ultimate Parent Stock**. No certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock shall
be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to any Ultimate Parent Common Stock or to vote or to any other rights of a
holder of Ultimate Parent Common Stock. All fractional shares to which a
single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to
receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three (3)
decimal places. In lieu of any fractional shares of Ultimate Parent Common
Stock, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive such fractional shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, rounded up to the
nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (a) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Ultimate Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would, but for this _Section 2.6_, be entitled to under
_Section 2.1_, and (b) the average of the volume weighted average price per
share of Ultimate Parent Common Stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "
_TSX_ ") (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or such other authoritative source
mutually selected by the Company and Parent) on each of the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (such average, the " _Average Price_ ")
(with each such trading days applicable price converted into United States
dollars using the spot exchange rate reported with respect to such day by
Bloomberg L.P. (or such other authoritative source mutually selected by the
Company and Parent) (such conversion rate, the " _Conversion Rate_ ")). The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_ is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

SECTION 3.7 **SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities**.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted or furnished all forms,

reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since the
Applicable Date, including those filed after the date hereof and including all

supplements thereto, collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of their
respective dates, or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in
effect on the date of any such filing. As of the time of filing with the SEC
(or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), none of the SEC Reports so filed contained, when filed, or if
filed after the date hereof will contain, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements

misleading, except to the extent that the information in such SEC Reports has
been amended or superseded by a later SEC Report filed prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries (including any related notes thereto) included in the SEC Reports

respective dates of filing, in each case in all material respects, with the
then applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) have been prepared, or if
filed after the date hereof, will be prepared, in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto); and (iii) fairly

material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting for the Company
and its subsidiaries. Except as does not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company (i)
is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management (including the Companys principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions) as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the Companys
most recent evaluation of internal control prior to the date hereof, the
Company has disclosed to its auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(d) Except (i) as reflected, accrued or reserved against in the financial
statements (including all notes thereto) of the Company and its subsidiaries
included in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof; (ii) for
liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
September 30, 2015; and (iii) for liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has or is subject to any liabilities or obligations of
a nature required by GAAP to

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) The Company or its subsidiary that is a party to a Company Material
Contract is in compliance with all terms and requirements of each Company
Material Contract, and no event has occurred that, with notice or the passage
of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default by the Company or any

Plan. "Company Plan" means each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as

SECTION 4.11 **Available Funds**. Parent has delivered to the Company a
correct and complete fully executed copy of (a)(i) the commitment letter,
dated February 9, 2016, between Ultimate Parent and The Bank of Nova Scotia,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto in effect as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Scotia Commitment Letter_ "), and (ii)
the fee letter referenced in the Scotia Commitment Letter (with only the fee,
certain other economic provisions and certain other confidential terms (none
of which adversely affects the conditionality, enforceability, termination,
principal amount or availability of the such financing) redacted) and (b) (i)
the commitment letter, dated February 9, 2016, between Ultimate Parent and
Goldman Sachs Bank USA, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments thereto in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Goldman
Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Scotia Commitment Letter, the "
_Commitment Letters_ "), and (ii) the fee letter referenced in the Goldman
Commitment Letter (with only the fee, certain other economic provisions and
certain other confidential terms (none of which adversely affects the
conditionality, enforceability, termination, principal amount or availability
of such financing) redacted), pursuant to which the financial institutions
party thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the
provision of such funds as set forth therein, the " _Committed Financing_ ").
Assuming the Committed Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, the aggregate net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters,
together with cash and cash equivalents on hand, will provide Parent and
Merger Sub with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient to permit Parent
to fund the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and other cash payments to
be made pursuant to _Article II_ and any other amounts payable by Ultimate
Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parents and Merger Subs obligations hereunder are not
subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Merger Subs, or any other
Persons ability to obtain financing for the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Commitment Letters have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified
or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the
respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. As of the date hereof,
the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligations of each of Ultimate Parent and the other parties
thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Ultimate
Parent under the Commitment Letters or any other party to the Commitment
Letters. Ultimate Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid on

 



      
 

 



 

or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Committed
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent (1) is not aware of any
fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations or
warranties of Ultimate Parent in either of the Commitment Letters inaccurate
in any material respect and (2) has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Committed Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Committed Financing will
not be made available on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts, arrangements or
understandings (written or oral) directly or indirectly related to the funding
of the Committed Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters (subject to the limitations set forth above) that could adversely
affect the amount, availability or conditions of the Committed Financing.

 



 

SECTION 4.12 **Solvency**. After giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of the aggregate consideration to
which the shareholders of the Company are entitled under _Article II_ and
payment of all related fees and expenses, the Ultimate Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not: (a) be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts, including contingent
and other liabilities, is greater than the fair market value of its assets or
because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required
to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature); (b) have unreasonably small capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged; or (c) have incurred debts, or be expected to incur debts, including
contingent and other liabilities, beyond its ability to pay them as they
become due.

 



 

SECTION 4.13 **No Other Information; No Other Representations or Warranties**.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company makes no
representations or warranties as to any matter whatsoever except as expressly
set forth in _Article III_. The representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ are made solely by the Company, and no Representative of the
Company shall have any responsibility or liability related thereto.

 



 

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Article
IV_ or contained in _Article V_, the Company acknowledges that none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes
any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent
or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided to the
Company. None of Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to the Company, or the Companys
use of, any such information, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Company in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.14 **Access to Information; Disclaimer**. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that it has conducted its own independent
investigation and analysis of the Company and its subsidiaries, their
respective businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, and has not
relied on any representation, warranty or other statement by any Person on
behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article
III_ of this Agreement, and that all other representations and warranties are
specifically disclaimed. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
Merger Sub further acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any of

 



      
 

 



 

its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents
or other Representatives has made any representation or warranty concerning
any estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans or other forward-looking
information regarding the Company, its subsidiaries or their respective

with the applicable requirements of applicable securities Laws as in effect on
the date of any such filing. As of the time of filing (or, if amended prior to
the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), none of the
Canadian Filings so filed contained, when filed, or if filed after the date
hereof will contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference

equity for the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated interim financial

its subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof (taking into account the

the periods indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) Ultimate Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
published rules and regulations of the Canadian Securities Regulators
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting for the Ultimate Parent and its subsidiaries. Except as

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ultimate Parent, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Ultimate Parent (i) is recorded and reported on a
timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Ultimate
Parents filings with the SEDAR and other public disclosure documents and (ii)
is accumulated and communicated to Ultimate Parents management (including
Ultimate Parents principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions) as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on Ultimate Parents most recent
evaluation of internal control prior to the date hereof, Ultimate Parent has
disclosed to its auditors and the audit committee of the Ultimate Parent Board
of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Ultimate Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Ultimate Parents internal control over financial
reporting.

statements (including all notes thereto) of Ultimate Parent and its
subsidiaries included in the Canadian Filings filed prior to the date hereof;
(ii) for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business since September 30, 2015; and (iii) for liabilities or obligations
incurred pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither
Ultimate Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has or is subject to any

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Ultimate Parent.

Parent, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
except (i) to the extent that any Material Contract expires or terminates in
accordance with its terms in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and (ii) for such failures to be legal, valid and binding or to
be in full force and effect that do not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect

Material Contract is in compliance with all terms and requirements of each

Ultimate Parent or any of its subsidiaries under any such Ultimate Parent
Material Contract, and, to the knowledge of Ultimate Parent, no other party to
any Ultimate Parent Material Contract is in breach or default (nor has any
event occurred which, with or without notice or the passage of time, or both,

Contract, except in each case where such violation, breach, default or event
of default does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ultimate
Parent. Except as does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ultimate
Parent, neither Ultimate Parent nor, to the knowledge of Ultimate Parent, any
of its subsidiaries has received written notice from any other party to an
Ultimate Parent Material Contract that such other party intends to terminate

pay any consent or similar fee to obtain such consents other than de minimis
amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed by Parent.

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

SECTION 7.1 **Acquisition Proposals**.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, and employees not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective consultants, attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, agents, investment bankers or other
representatives (" _Representatives_ ") not to (and shall not authorize or
permit their respective Representatives to), (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, or the making, submission or announcement
of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any negotiations
or discussions concerning, or furnish or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any Person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve,
endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement for any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that it is
understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Company Board of
Directors permitted under _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not be
deemed to be a breach or violation of this _Section 7.1(a)_ or, in the case
of _Section 7.1(b)(i)_  _(iv)_ , give Ultimate Parent or Parent a right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_. The Company shall,
and shall cause its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and
employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person
(other than the Parties) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, in each
case that exist as of the date hereof, and (ii) promptly request each Person
(other than the Parties) that has prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company to return or destroy all confidential
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
subsidiaries prior to the date hereof. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing of the receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof, which notice shall include
a summary of the material terms of, including the identity of the Person
making, such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed in
all material respects on a prompt basis of the current status and material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal including any material changes in
respect of any such Acquisition Proposal and shall deliver to Parent a summary
of any material changes to any such Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or
release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent
necessary to allow for a confidential Acquisition Proposal to be made to the
Company or the Company Board of Directors if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action could be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and so long as the
Company promptly notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such
counterparty) after granting any such waiver, amendment or release and, if
requested by Parent, grants Parent a waiver, amendment or release of any
similar provision under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section
7.3_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Company Board of Directors from:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) (x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position in accordance
with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (y)
making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (z) making any
disclosure to shareholders of the Company with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal made after the date
hereof if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, it determines that it is legally
required to do so or failing to do so could be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that
neither the Company nor its Company Board of Directors may take an action that
would constitute a Company Change of Recommendation in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by _Section 7.1(d)_, and compliance
with the foregoing shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any
action taken pursuant thereto has under any other provision of this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in
discussions with any Person or group and their respective Representatives who
has made an Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof solely for the purpose
of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof;

 



 

(iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, providing access to its
properties, books and records and providing information or data in response to
a request therefor by a Person or group who has made a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof if the Company Board of Directors
(A) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal, and (B) has received from the Person so requesting such information
an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; or

 



 

(iv) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, participating and engaging
in any negotiations or discussions with any Person or group and their
respective Representatives who has made a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof (which negotiations or discussions need not be
solely for clarification purposes) if the Company Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal;

 



 

 _provided_ , that with respect to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_  (iv), (A) in the
case of _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_  _(iv)_ , such Acquisition Proposal was not
solicited in material breach of _Section 7.1(a)_, (B) in the case of _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_  _(iv)_ , the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action could be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (C) in the case of _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ \- _(iv),_ the Company gives Parent the notice required by
_Section 7.1(a)_, and (D) in the case of _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, the Company
furnishes any information provided to the maker of the Acquisition Proposal
only pursuant to an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and such
furnished information is delivered to Parent at substantially the same time

 



      
 

 



 

(to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or made
available by the Company to Parent).

 



 

(c) Except as contemplated by _Section 7.1(d)_, neither the Company Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify, or resolve to or propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify
the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Ultimate Parent or Parent,
(B) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Recommendation,
(C) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (D) fail to reaffirm or re-publish the Company Recommendation within
ten (10) Business Days of being requested by Parent to do so (provided,
however, that Parent shall not be entitled to request such a reaffirmation or
re-publishing more than one (1) time with respect to any single Acquisition
Proposal other than in connection with an amendment to any financial terms of
such Acquisition Proposal or any other material amendment to such Acquisition
Proposal) or (E) fail to announce publicly, within ten (10) Business Days
after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to any securities of the
Company has been commenced, that the Company Board of Directors recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer (each such action set forth in
clauses (A) through (E) above being a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ "),
(ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company to enter into a merger agreement,
letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset
purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar contract (other than the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or
recommend any tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate,
delay or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, or (iii) take any action pursuant to which any Person
(other than Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates) or Acquisition Proposal would become exempt from or not otherwise
subject to any take-over statute or certificate of incorporation provision
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, a change of
the Company Recommendation to "neutral" is a Company Change of Recommendation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.1_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (i) the Company Board of
Directors may effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event or (ii) if the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal from a third party that did
not otherwise result from a material breach of _Section 7.1(a)_, that such
proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn, the Company or the Company Board of Directors may (i) make a
Company Change of Recommendation and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, if (and only if) (A) in the event the Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, the Company pays to Parent any
Company Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(i)_
and (B) after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, the Company Board of Directors determines that the failure to make a
Company Change of Recommendation, or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or the Company Board of Directors, as applicable, may only take the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) if (x) the Company delivers to
Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors proposes to take such action and containing (1) the
material details of such Intervening Event or the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board of Directors and (2) a copy of the most current draft of
any written agreement relating to the Superior Proposal and (y) at or after
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice (such
period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the day on
which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the " _Notice Period_ "), the
Company Board of Directors reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to make a Company
Change of Recommendation, or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(ii)_, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws, and, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal,
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. If
requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to,
during the Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and
its Representatives (including by making the Companys officers and
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (A) in the case of an
Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that if Ultimate Parent or
Parent has committed to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and there
has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal, the Company Board of Directors shall provide a new Company Notice
and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the date of such notice)
or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board
of Directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation would not be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws. Any such Company Change of Recommendation shall not change
the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board of
Directors in any respect that would have the effect of causing any corporate
takeover statute or other similar statute or any provision of the Charter to
be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
Notwithstanding any Company Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to its terms, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting for the
purpose of approving the Merger, and nothing contained in this _Section 7.1_,
including any rights of the Company to take certain actions pursuant to this
_Section 7.1_, shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest or offer from any Person or group of Persons (other than Ultimate
Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates) relating to any
transaction or series of transactions, involving (A) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of (1) a business or assets that constitute 20% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) 20% or more of the total voting

 



      
 

 



 

power of the equity securities of the Company, (B) any tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction that if consummated would result in any Person or
group of Persons beneficially owning 20% or more of the total voting power of
the equity securities of the Company, or (C) any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any

more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal involving (A)
assets that generate more than 50% of the consolidated total revenues of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) assets that constitute
more than 50% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) more than 50% of the total voting power
of the equity securities of the Company, in each case, that the Company Board
of Directors in good faith determines, after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor, would, if consummated, result in a transaction
that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of
the Company than the transactions contemplated hereby after taking into
account all such factors and matters considered appropriate in good faith by
the Company Board of Directors (including, to the extent considered
appropriate by the Company Board of Directors, (i) all strategic
considerations, including whether such Acquisition Proposal is more favorable
from a long-term strategic standpoint, (ii) financial provisions and the
payment of the Company Termination Fee, (iii) legal and regulatory conditions
and other undertakings relating to the Companys and its subsidiarys
customers, suppliers, regulators, lenders, partners, employees and other
constituencies, (iv) probable timing, (v) likelihood of consummation and (vi)
with respect to which the cash consideration and other amounts (including
costs associated with the Acquisition Proposal) payable at Closing are subject
to fully committed financing from recognized financial institutions), and
after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed
to in writing by Ultimate Parent and Parent in response to such Superior
Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 7.1(d)_ or otherwise.

reasoned judgment concerning the matters to be placed before them at the
Ultimate Parent Shareholder Meeting. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any

Registration Statement, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
mailing the Proxy Statement or any other materials used in connection with the
Company Shareholders Meeting that constitute "proxy materials" or
"solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17
under the Exchange Act or are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of
"proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Circular or any other
materials used in connection with the Ultimate Parent Shareholder Meeting that
constitute an "information circular", "proxy-related materials" or are
otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are used
under applicable Canadian securities Law or "proxy materials" or "solicitation
materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 under the
Exchange Act or are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as
those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or the TSX, as
applicable, with respect thereto, each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company (i) shall provide the other an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of
such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or response
all comments reasonably proposed by each other. Each of Ultimate Parent,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement and Circular
which shall have become false or misleading. Unless the Company Board of
Directors has made a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 7.1(d)_, terminated the Agreement and paid the Company Termination
Fee, the Company Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
the Company, Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by any Party that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Registration
Statement or the Circular so that any such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other
Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be filed with the SEC or Canadian Securities Regulators, as applicable,
as promptly as practicable after the other Parties have had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company and/or
Ultimate Parent.

(a) Notwithstanding any Company Change of Recommendation, the Company, acting
through its Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall
promptly (but in no more than twenty (20) Business Days) following declaration

no further comments on or will not review the Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement, take all reasonable action necessary to duly call, give notice of,

shareholders prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company, acting
through its Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall subject
to _Section 7.1(d)_, (a) include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Recommendation and, subject to the consent of each of the Company Financial

(a) During the Interim Period, the Parties will, in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and except to the extent a different standard
is specified in another applicable provision of this Agreement, (i) proceed
diligently and in good faith and use best efforts, as promptly as practicable
in accordance with _Section 7.4(c)_, to obtain the Consents and Filings
listed in _Section 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and _Sections
4.3(b)_ and _5.5(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and to make all
required filings with, and to give all required notices to, the applicable
Governmental Entities, (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

practicable), and (iii) cooperate in good faith with the applicable
Governmental Entities or other Persons and provide promptly such other
information and communications to such Governmental Entities or other Persons
as such Governmental Entities or other Persons may reasonably request in
connection therewith. The Company shall not consent to any voluntary delay of
the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 



 

(b) During the Interim Period, the Parties will provide prompt notification to
each other when any such approval referred to in _Section 7.4(a)_ is
obtained, taken, made, given or denied, as applicable, and will advise each
other of any material communications with any Governmental Entity or other
Person regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) giving the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any material, written request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(ii) keeping the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. Subject to

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and unless prohibited
by the reasonable request of any Governmental Entity, Parent shall have the
right to review and approve in advance and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the
other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal (including all of the information relating to Ultimate
Parent, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
subsidiaries, that appears in any filing) made with, or written materials
submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each Party will permit authorized representatives of the
other Parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any material, written document, opinion
or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. Ultimate
Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall, subject to and without limiting Ultimate
Parents, Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this _Section 7.4_, be
permitted to implement its strategy and otherwise pursue its position as to
which it has (i) consulted with the Company and taken the Companys views into
account in good faith and (ii) developed, implemented and pursued with a view
to obtaining any necessary clearances pursuant to antitrust Laws as promptly
as practicable (and in any event by the End Date) and the Company agrees it
shall not take a position in any filing, meeting or communication with any
Governmental Entity that is contrary to, or inconsistent with, such strategy
and position in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to take
the lead in all joint meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity
in connection with obtaining any necessary clearances pursuant to any
competition law authorities; _provided_ , that Ultimate Parent, Parent and
Merger Sub shall have complied with the other provisions of this _Section
7.4_. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company, Ultimate Parent
and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively sensitive
information and materials of a Party may be provided to the other Party on an
outside counsel-only basis.

 



 

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing covenants:

 



 

(i) Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their best
efforts to make any premerger notification filing required under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby at a time to be mutually
agreed within five (5) months following the execution of this Agreement.
Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall supply as promptly
as reasonably practicable any additional information or documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and shall take all other
actions, proper or advisable consistent with this _Section 7.4_ (including
_Section 7.4(d)_), to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Ultimate Parent,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall comply substantially with any
additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions, made by
the Antitrust Division of the United States

 



      
 

 



 

Department of Justice, the United States Federal Trade Commission or the
antitrust or competition law authorities of any other jurisdiction (the "
_Antitrust Authorities_ ") and use best efforts to take all other actions to
obtain clearance from the Antitrust Authorities. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall exercise its best efforts, and the Company shall cooperate fully with
Parent and Merger Sub, to promptly prevent the entry in any claim brought by
an Antitrust Authority of any order that would prohibit, make unlawful or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in any material
respect.

 



 

(ii) Other than with respect to filings under the HSR Act, the Parties will,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
and in any event at a mutually agreed time within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the date hereof, prepare and file, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith in accordance with _Section 9.3_, with each applicable
Governmental Entity requests for such Consents as may be necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and as set forth on _Section 3.5(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, other than with respect to applications and filings to be
made with the Federal Communications Commission, which shall be made at a time
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company. The Parties will diligently
pursue and use their best efforts to obtain such Consents and will cooperate
with each other in seeking such Consents. To such end, the Parties agree to
make reasonably available the personnel and other resources of their
respective organizations in order to obtain all such Consents. Each Party will
promptly inform the other Parties of any material communication received by
such Party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity from which
any such Consent is required, unless prohibited by the reasonable request of
any Governmental Entity, and of any material communication received or given
in connection with any claim by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and will permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any claim by a private party, with such other Person, and to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and to participate in such meetings and
conferences.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement and this _Section 7.4_,
Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the making of the Filings
and obtaining the Consents listed in _Section 3.5(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and _Section 4.3(b)_ and _Section 5.5(b)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and the making of any other required Filings and the
obtaining of any other required Consents with or from any Governmental Entity,
are the responsibility of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub, and that
Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to make such Filings or obtain such
Consents with or from any Governmental Entity as are required in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i)
taking such actions and agreeing to such requirements, commitments,
restrictions, rate, capitalization or other concessions or conditions to
mitigate any concerns as may be requested or required by a Governmental Entity
in connection with any Filing or Consent, (ii) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, settlement agreement, hold
separate order or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries) or any interests therein, (iii) terminating or restructuring
existing relationships, contractual or governance rights or obligations of
Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries), (iv) terminating any venture or other arrangement and (v)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parents or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporations
and its subsidiaries) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or control, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries) or any interests therein, in each case as may be required in
order to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End
Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any preliminary or permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date). Without
limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date,
Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub agree that except as may be agreed in
writing by the Company, Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall not,
shall cause their Affiliates not to, and shall not permit any action, which
would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the ability of
the Parties to secure all required Filings or Consents with or from any
Governmental Entity to consummate the transactions hereunder, or take any
action with any Governmental Entity relating to the foregoing, or agree, in
writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing, in each case which would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or result in the failure to satisfy any
condition to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) Subject to the obligations under _Section 7.4(a)_, in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective best efforts to contest, resist, prevent, oppose and remove any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents, restrains,
restricts or otherwise prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub must
defend, at their cost and expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or
administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries
shall not be required to agree to any term or take any action in connection
with its obligations under this _Section 7.4(e)_ that is not conditioned on
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) inform
reasonably in advance Parent prior to making any material changes in the
Companys or its Subsidiaries rates or charges, standards of service or
accounting from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) further
inform reasonably in advance Parent prior to initiating any material
proceeding (or filing any amendment thereto), or effecting any material
agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

commitment, settlement, arrangement or consent, whether written or oral,
formal or informal, with respect thereto.

 



 

SECTION 7.5 **Notification of Certain Matters**. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Ultimate Parent and Parent, and Ultimate Parent and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such Party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Ultimate Parent or Parent and (b)
any actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced or, to such Partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such Party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that neither the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ nor the access to any information
pursuant to _Section 7.6_ shall (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance
with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies
available to the Party receiving such notice. The Parties agree and
acknowledge that the Companys, on the one hand, and Ultimate Parents or
Parents on the other hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this
_Section 7.5_ shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the condition referred to in _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_,
respectively, shall have been satisfied with respect to performance in all
material respects with this _Section 7.5_.

 



 

SECTION 7.6 **Access to Information; Confidentiality**.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_, upon reasonable prior written notice

Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other Governmental
Entity, and (iii) upon written request, as soon as reasonably practicable
provide Parent and Ultimate Parent with information relating to any material
developments in any audit or similar proceeding related to any material Tax
matters of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such officers, employees
and other authorized Representatives of their normal duties and shall not
include any environmental sampling or invasive environmental testing. Neither
the Company

 



      
 

 



 

nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice its
rights or the rights of any of its officers, directors or employees,
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or binding agreement; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (a) allow for such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege, (b) obtain the
required consent of any third party to provide access to or disclosure of such
information with respect to any confidential Contract to which the Company or
its subsidiaries is party, or (c) develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Ultimate Parent, Parent and the Company; it being understood and agreed that
(i) the Company shall advise Ultimate Parent and Parent in such circumstances
that it is unable to comply with Ultimate Parents and Parents reasonable
requests for information as a result of attorney-client privilege, Contract
obligation or applicable Law, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to generally describe the types of information being withheld and (ii)
Parent shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable, documented, out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Companys actions described
above in clauses (a)  (c). All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section 7.6(a)_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person
designated by the Company. No access, review or notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.6_ shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the
accuracy of any representation or warranty given by any of the Parties to any
of the other Parties.

 



 

(b) Each Party will comply with terms and conditions of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated November 2, 2015, between the Company and Ultimate Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause
their respective officers, employees, auditors and other Representatives to
hold and treat, in confidence all documents and information concerning, on the
one hand, the Company and its subsidiaries furnished to Ultimate Parent,
Parent or Merger Sub, and on the other hand, Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger
Sub and their respective subsidiaries furnished to the Company, in each case
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
amended as of the date hereof (i) to permit Parent and its Affiliates to take
any action permitted to be taken hereunder, including any action taken by
Ultimate Parent or Parent in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by a
Person other than Ultimate Parent and Parent, (ii) such that each of the
Representatives and Financing Sources hereunder shall be deemed a
"Representative" under the Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) to permit
disclosure of information by the Financing Sources in accordance with the
confidentiality provisions in the Commitment Letters or any other
confidentiality provisions substantially consistent therewith entered into
with any Financing Sources in connection with the Financing. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement, or the taking of any
action permitted by this Agreement, shall constitute or be deemed a request
from Parent or Ultimate Parent that the Company amend, waive, grant any
consent under or otherwise not enforce any provision of Section 7 of the
Confidentiality Agreement or any reference to any desire or intention to do
so.

 



       
 

 



 

SECTION 7.7 **Stock Exchange Delisting**. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Ultimate Parent and Parent and use reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done

applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to
enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company

Proxy Statement, the Circular, the Registration Statement, SEC Filings, QandAs
or other publicly disclosed documents, in each case, to the extent such

quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity (or, in the
case of the Company, in accordance with _Section 7.1(b)(i)_). Prior to making
any material, broad-based written communications to the employees of the
Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries that primarily relates to the

credit for prior service, (y) to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits or (z) for purposes of any plan or arrangement that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to the level of benefits or

level achievement, which payment shall be pro-rated based on a fraction (x)
the numerator of which is the number days in the year (or performance period)

at Parents reasonable request, distribute WARN Act notices on Parents behalf
to such employees as directed by Parent in a form prepared by Parent in

any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason with or
without cause.

SECTION 7.10 **Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that it
will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ")
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative and whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "),
arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to
the Effective Time), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Michigan Law and its Company Articles of Incorporation and
Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such
Person (and the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding,
including any expenses incurred in enforcing such Persons rights under this
_Section 7.10_, to the extent that such indemnification with respect to or
advancement of such expenses is authorized under the Company Articles of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws or the articles of incorporation and bylaws,
or equivalent organizational documents, of any subsidiary; _provided_ that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.10_); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under
Michigan Law and the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws shall be
made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and approved
by a majority of the Indemnified Parties who are seeking indemnity with
respect to such Proceeding (and if such parties cannot

 



      
 

 



 

agree, counsel will be selected by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services). In the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents,
and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such
matter, and no such settlement shall affect the Surviving Corporations
indemnification obligations hereunder. In the event any Proceeding is brought
against any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party under this _Section 7.10_, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time, using Jones Day as counsel or such other counsel as may be
selected by the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation and approved
by a majority of the Indemnified Parties who are seeking indemnity with
respect to such Proceeding (and if such parties cannot agree, counsel will be
selected by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services), (ii) each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel at the
Surviving Corporations expense (which may be Jones Day) if the Surviving
Corporation shall elect not to control the defense of any such Proceeding and
(iii) no Indemnified Party shall be liable for any settlement effected without
his or her prior express written consent.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
7.10(a)_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying
Party.

 



 

(c) The provisions in the Surviving Corporations articles of incorporation
and bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less
favorable to such directors and officers than such provisions contained in the
Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws in effect as of the date
hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, at no expense to
the beneficiaries, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the

less advantageous to the insured than the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by

events that occurred at or before the Effective Time, including the

Laws. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall

claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.10_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or to the Companys knowledge,
threatened in writing against the Company or any members of its Company Board
of Directors after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly notify Ultimate
Parent and Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Ultimate
Parent and Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall give Ultimate Parent and Parent the opportunity to participate,
at Ultimate Parents and Parents expense, in the defense and settlement of
any Transaction Litigation and give due consideration to Ultimate Parents and

amendment to the credit facilities set forth on _Section 7.15(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule so that, after giving effect to the Merger, there
exists no default or event of default with respect to such credit facilities;
_provided_ , that any such amendment would be conducted in coordination with

foregoing, such cooperation shall in any event include using reasonable best

letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) (including by providing
customary management letters and requesting consent for use of (and using
reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent) their reports in any materials
relating to the Financing and in connection with any filings required to be
made by Ultimate Parent or Parent relating to the Financing) from such
accounting firm, (vi) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for
any portion of the Financing and (vii) furnishing Ultimate Parent, Parent and
any Financing Sources at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date with
documentation and other information reasonably necessary in order for the
Financing Sources to comply with applicable Law or as required by any
Governmental Entity with respect to any Financing under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT Act, in each case, to the extent that such documentation and
information has been reasonably requested in writing at least ten (10) days
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section
7.15_ shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably
disrupt or interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or the conduct thereof, (B) require the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or
make any payment in connection with the Financing, prior to the Effective Time

cases) to the Company or such subsidiary therefor), or incur any liability in
connection with the Financing that is effective prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, (C) other than with respect to the second sentence of _Section
7.15(b)_, require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any

access, (G) require the Company to prepare any pro forma financial statements
or pro forma adjustments giving effect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated herein, but rather, any information provided by the Company shall
relate solely to the financial information and data derived from the Companys
and its subsidiaries historical books and records, or (H) require the Company
to

 



      
 

 



 

prepare separate financial statements for any subsidiary of the Company,
prepare any "guarantor/non-guarantor" footnote to any financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries or change any fiscal period. Without limiting
the foregoing proviso, Parent and Ultimate Parent agree to reimburse the
Company and its subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) in connection with the Financing promptly following
the issuance or incurrence thereof (but excluding any costs, fees and expenses
of preparing the Required Financial Statements, which shall not be
reimbursed). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, awards, judgments and penalties of any type actually suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken, or cooperation
provided, by the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.15_; in
each case, except to the extent that any such obligations, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties, fees, costs or other
liabilities are suffered or incurred as a result of the Companys gross
negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, material breach of this Agreement
or arising out of a material misstatement in or failure to state a material
fact pertinent to the information provided by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this _Section 7.15(b)_, as applicable, as determined in a final,
non-appealable judgment by court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its subsidiaries logos
by Ultimate Parent, Parent, their respective licensees and any Financing
Source in connection with the Financing, provided, that such logos are used
solely in a customary manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and on such other customary
terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose. Parent, Ultimate
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing or any alternative financing is not a condition to the Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and
Ultimate Parent shall be permitted, in connection with the syndication of the
Financing, to share all information subject to such agreement with any
Financing Sources and their Representatives, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by such Financing Sources with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) In the event Ultimate Parent and Parent desire to undertake a Third Party
Investment to be effective on or prior to Closing, binding commitments for
such Third Party Investment must be in place no later than ninety (90) days
after the date hereof (which date may be extended for thirty (30) days with
the consent of the Company (which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), which consent shall not be required where such Third
Party Investor would not reasonably be expected to delay any Required
Regulatory Approval) and prior to such date Ultimate Parent shall provide
written notice to the Company which such notice shall contain the identity of
each Third Party Investor, the amount that such Third Party Investor will
invest in the Third Party Investment and all of the other material terms and
conditions of such Third Party Investment. Third Party Investors shall not be
permitted to have direct or indirect beneficial ownership of the Company (on,
prior to or immediately

 



       
 

 



 

following the Closing) (i) that exceeds 19.9% in the aggregate or (ii) that
would prevent Parent from meeting the requirements of Section 1504(a)(2) of
the Code with respect to its ownership of the Surviving Corporation (taking
into account any agreement relating to the rights of the Third Party Investors
to nominate or appoint directors to the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation). No Third Party Investor will, at any time from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article IX_, impair the incentives granted by FERC to
subsidiaries of the Company as a result of the Companys independence from
Market Participants. In connection with any Third Party Investment, Ultimate
Parent and Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to
the status of such Third Party Investment, shall consult with the Company and,
upon the written request of the Company or its Representatives, regarding the
terms of such Third Party Investment and shall consider in good faith any
advice or comments provided by the Company or its Representatives with respect
to such Third Party Investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section
7.15(d)_, Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall not undertake any Third
Party Investment that would reasonably be expected to materially delay,
materially impede or otherwise prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including as a result of any Consents of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Ultimate Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause such
Third Party Investor to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance as
necessary or advisable in connection with obtaining any Consents of any
Governmental Entity to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any Third Party Investment).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including,
without limitation, _Section 9.2(f)_), the Company (on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates and each officer, director, employee, equityholder, member,
manager, partner, advisor, attorney, agent and representative thereof) (i)
hereby waives any claims or rights against any Financing Source relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letters and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, (ii) hereby agrees not to commence or
support any suit, action or proceeding against any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letters and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise and (iii) hereby acknowledges and
agrees that no Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or
damages to the Company (or such other Persons) in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letters and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

SECTION 7.16 **Post-Merger Operations**.

 



 

(a) For ten (10) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain (i) its headquarters in Novi, Michigan and (ii) the
regional headquarters of each of the Companys operating subsidiaries in the
metropolitan area where it is located as of immediately prior the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) The Parties each agree that provision of charitable contributions and
community support in the communities in which the Company currently operate
serve a number of important corporate goals. During the one-year period
immediately following the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, Ultimate Parent, Parent and their respective Affiliates will provide
charitable contributions and other community support within the communities in
which the Company and its subsidiaries operates, at a level comparable in the
aggregate to the levels currently provided by the Company and its subsidiaries
as set forth in _Section 7.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) For three (3) years from and after the Effective Time, Ultimate Parent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not and shall not
permit any of its subsidiaries, to implement any voluntary workforce
reduction, employee restructuring or job elimination programs or initiatives
that would result in the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries employing
substantially fewer individuals in the aggregate than they employed
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 7.17 **Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub Financing Cooperation.**

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.17(c)_, each of Ultimate Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such
actions and do, or cause to be done, such things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Committed Financing, including using
reasonable best efforts to enforce in all material respects its rights under
the Commitment Letters. Ultimate Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed with respect to any material developments concerning the status of
the Financing and shall promptly respond to any reasonable written requests
from the Company concerning such status. Ultimate Parent agrees to notify the
Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, after
Ultimate Parent has knowledge thereof, if at any time prior to the Closing
Date (i) any of the Commitment Letters or any of the commitments with respect
to the Committed Financing thereunder or any definitive financing agreement
entered into in respect of any of the Permanent Financing, as applicable,
shall expire or be terminated (except, in either case, in accordance with its
terms or unless concurrently replaced by commitments from other financing
sources or from proceeds of any Permanent Financing or other cash or cash
equivalents or otherwise in accordance with the terms of _Section 7.17(c)_),
(ii) for any reason, all or a portion of the Committed Financing under the
Commitment Letters becomes unavailable (except in accordance with its terms or
unless concurrently replaced by any Permanent Financing) or (iii) any
Financing Source or any other Person that is a party to any of the Commitment
Letters breaches, defaults or repudiates any of its obligations with respect
to the Commitment Letters or, to the knowledge of Ultimate Parent, threatens
to do any of the foregoing and which breach, default or repudiation would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality, timing,
availability or amount of the Committed Financing. If Ultimate Parent becomes
aware that any portion of the Committed Financing becomes unavailable under
either of the Commitment Letters, except in accordance with the terms of the
Commitment Letters or unless concurrently replaced any Permanent Financing,
Ultimate Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (and Ultimate Parent shall not agree or consent to
such Committed Financing becoming unavailable except as permitted under
_Section 7.17(c)_).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event the Committed Financing (or any Permanent Financing) or any
portion thereof is funded in advance of the Closing Date, then Ultimate
Parent, Merger Sub or any other applicable subsidiary thereof shall keep and
maintain at all times prior to the Closing Date the net proceeds of the
Committed Financing (or any Permanent Financing) available for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that if
the terms of the Committed Financing (or any Permanent Financing) require the
net proceeds of the Committed Financing (or any Permanent Financing) to be
held in escrow (or similar arrangement) pending the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, then such proceeds may be held
in escrow, so long as the conditions to the release of such funds are no more
onerous to Ultimate Parent or its applicable subsidiary than the conditions to
borrowing of the Committed Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters.
(unless such conditions would not be reasonably expected to (i) delay or
prevent the Closing or (ii) adversely impact the ability of Ultimate Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing).

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.17(c)_, neither Ultimate
Parent, Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement, modification, termination or reduction of (other than in
accordance with its terms), or grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy or
other provision under either Commitment Letter without the prior written
consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if such
amendment, supplement, modification, termination, reduction or waiver would or
would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) impose
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the
funding of the Committed Financing (unless such new, additional or other
conditions would not be reasonably expected to (A) delay or prevent the
Closing or (B) adversely impact the ability of Ultimate Parent or Merger Sub
to obtain the Financing), (iii) adversely impact the ability of Ultimate
Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or (iv) materially adversely
impact the ability of Ultimate Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letters; provided that,
notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.17(c)_ or in _Section 7.17(a)_
to the contrary, Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub may (x) amend,
supplement or modify any Commitment Letter to (I) add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
applicable Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (and, in
connection therewith, to otherwise modify the applicable Commitment Letter in
the manner contemplated by its terms) and/or (II) to reduce the commitments
under either or both Commitment Letters if Ultimate Parent reasonably
determines that, after giving effect to such reduction, the aggregate net
proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters, together with cash and cash
equivalents on hand, will provide Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub with
cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient to permit Ultimate Parent and
Parent to fund its obligations under this Agreement, and (y) enter into
alternative, replacement, take-out or additional financing arrangements
(whether debt or equity and whether incurred by Ultimate Parent or any of its
Affiliates, and including any Third Party Investment) and thereby reduce all
or a portion of the aggregate amount of the Committed Financing by the amount
of, or the amount of any commitment (including pursuant to working capital
facilities) for, any such financing so long as the conditions to funding, if
any, under such financing arrangements satisfy clause (ii) above (any such
alternative, replacement, take-out or additional financing arrangements, a "
_Permanent Financing_ " and, together with the Committed Financing, the "
_Financing_ " ). Upon any amendment, supplement, modification, termination,
reduction or waiver of any Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section
7.17_ or any replacement of any Commitment Letter in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with _Section 7.17(a)_, (i) references herein to a "Commitment
Letter" shall include such document as amended, supplemented, modified,
terminated, reduced, or replaced in accordance with _Section 7.17_ and (ii)
references to "Committed Financing" shall include the financing contemplated
by such Commitment Letter as amended, supplemented, modified or waived in
compliance with this _Section 7.17(c)_.

 



 

SECTION 7.18 **Listing of Shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock**. Prior to
the Closing Date, Ultimate Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Ultimate Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be authorized
for listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the TSX, subject, if necessary,
to official notice of issuance. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Ultimate Parent in connection with the foregoing,
including by providing information reasonably requested by Ultimate Parent in
connection therewith.

 



 

SECTION 7.19 **Ultimate Parent Board of Directors**. The chief executive
officer of the Company as of the date hereof (the " _Chief Executive Officer_
") shall be permitted to attend (but not participate in) all meetings of the
Ultimate Parent Board of Directors and to receive all information distributed
to the directors from the Effective Time until the first annual general
meeting of Ultimate Parents shareholders following the Effective Time (the "
_First Ultimate Parent AGM_ "). Prior to the First Ultimate Parent AGM,
Ultimate Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Chief Executive
Officer or, if the Chief Executive Officer is still the chief executive
officer of the Surviving Corporation, a Person mutually agreed by the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation and the Ultimate Parent Board of
Directors, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, to be elected to
the Ultimate Parent Board of Directors at the First Ultimate Parent AGM and at
the next annual general meeting of the Ultimate Parents shareholders
immediately following the First Ultimate Parent AGM to serve until the next
subsequent annual general meeting of the Ultimate Parents shareholders;

subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other

that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of

extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit,

matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further

benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution
or collection of any amount to which the Party is entitled pursuant to the
final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each Party expressly
acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America; _provided_

10.13_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in
the State of Delaware other than for such purpose. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein (and subject to, and without limiting, _Section
7.15(e)_), each party hereto hereby submits itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (a) except as specified in (b) below, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if that court does
not have subject matter jurisdiction, in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and any

against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any letters or
agreements with such Financing Source and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or
otherwise, and hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any such suit,
action or proceeding in any other forum, and (b) solely with respect to any

action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, any letters or agreements with such Financing Source and the

any person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative, formal or informal, including any
appeal, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer
of the corporation, or, while serving as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation
as a director, officer, member, partner, trustee, employee, fiduciary, or
agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including
service with respect to employee benefit plans or public service or charitable
organizations, against expenses (including actual and reasonable attorney fees
and disbursements), liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines, excise taxes,
and amounts paid in settlement actually and incurred by him or her in
connection with such action, suit, or proceeding. Indemnification may continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation and may inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors
and administrators. The corporation, by provisions in its bylaws or by
agreement, may grant to any current or former director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation the right to, or regulate the manner of providing to
any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCA. Any right to
indemnification conferred as permitted by this _Article V_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute (including the MBCA), any other provision of these
Articles, any provision of the bylaws, any agreement, any vote of shareholders
or the Board of Directors or otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 

 **Corporate Action Without Meeting of Shareholders**

 



 

Any action required or permitted by the MBCA to be taken at an annual or
special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the

      
 

 



 

holders of record of outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. The written consent shall bear the date of signature of
each shareholder who signs the consent. No written consents shall be effective
to take corporate action unless, within sixty (60) days after the record date
for determining shareholders entitled to express consent to or dissent from a
proposal with a meeting, written consents dated not more than ten (10) days
before the record date and signed by a sufficient number of shareholders to
take the action are delivered to the Corporation. Delivery shall be to the
Corporations registered office, its principal place of business or an officer
or agent of the Corporation having custody of the minutes of the proceedings
of its shareholders. Deliver made to a Corporations registered office shall
be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

 



 

Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to shareholders who would have
been entitled to notice of the shareholder meeting if the action had been
taken at a meeting and who have not consented to the action in writing. An
electronic transmission consenting to an action must comply with Section
407(3) of the MBCA.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**
