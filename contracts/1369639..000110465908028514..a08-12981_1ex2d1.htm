14-2-1325 and 14-2-1327 of the GBCC (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "),

  



        
   

  



  

shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Total Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GBCC (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 14-2-1302 of the GBCC), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
rights to appraisal under the GBCC. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holders shares of common stock of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Total Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common
Stock, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give the Owners ( _i_
) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the GBCC and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and ( _ii_ ) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the GBCC.

  



  

Section 1.4 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any share
certificates representing the Company Shares (each a " _Certificate_ ") shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Surviving Corporation will pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the pro rata Total Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 1.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Closing; Payments; Effects_.

  



  

(a) _Closing_. The closing of the Merger and the other transactions

the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Delivery of Share Certificates_. At the Closing, the Sellers shall

(h) _Company Options_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company Option, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time and shall be converted into the right to
receive a portion of the Total Merger Consideration such that, for each share
of Company Common Stock underlying a Company Option, the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive:

  



  

(i) an amount of cash equal to ( _x_ ) the Per Share Cash Consideration minus
( _y_ ) the exercise price of such Company Option;

  



  

(ii) a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the Per Share Stock
Consideration;

  



  

(iii) Escrowed Shares and Escrowed Cash in accordance with the terms of this

holder of the applicable Company Option and the shares of Parent

that all outstanding Company Options are treated as provided for in this
_Section 1.5(h)_, and that no holder of any such Company Option shall have
any rights thereafter with respect thereto except as expressly provided in
this _Section 1.5(h)_.

  



  

(i) _No Further Ownership Rights in Equity Securities of the Company_. The
Total Merger Consideration issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Equity Securities of the Company, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of any
Equity Securities of the Company that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  



  

(j) _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of
the GBCC.  Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the
Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation may, at
any time after the Effective Time, take any action (including executing and
delivering any document) in the name and on behalf of either the Company or
Merger Sub that is reasonably necessary in order to carry out and effectuate
the Merger consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(k) _Tax Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold all amounts required to

having been paid.

otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or any payment made to the holder of any Company Option
pursuant to this Agreement, an amount sufficient to discharge any
indebtedness of the recipient of such consideration and/or payment to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any indebtedness that is guaranteed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, any
indebtedness of such recipient incurred to purchase any shares of Company
Common Stock and set forth in Section 1.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
shall be applied first to such indebtedness and shall be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in respect of
their Company Common Stock or Company Options. To the extent that the
application of such consideration in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence would not be sufficient to discharge any such
indebtedness, the Company shall cause the Persons owing such indebtedness to
repay such indebtedness in cash prior to the Closing (such repayments by such
Persons collectively the " _Shortfall Payments_ ").

  



  

Section 1.7 _Earnout_.

  



  

(a) _Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA_.

  



  

(i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
combined Adjusted EBITDA to be determined and an Adjusted EBITDA statement to
be delivered to the Sellers Representative, with appropriate workpapers and
backup for the calculations made therein, on or before the thirtieth (30th)
day after the last day of Year One, Year Two and Year Three, as the case may
be (the " _Annual Income Statement_ ").

  



  

(ii) If within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Annual Income
Statement by Sellers Representative, the Sellers Representative has not
given Parent written notice of objection to such Annual Income Statement
(such notice must contain a statement in reasonable detail of the basis of
such objections), then the Companys and its Subsidiaries combined Adjusted
EBITDA reflected in the Annual Income Statement will be used in computing any
payments due under this Section 1.7. If Sellers Representative gives such
notice of objection, and the items in dispute cannot be resolved by agreement
between the Parent and the Sellers Representative within thirty (30) days
following Parents receipt of the Sellers Representatives written
objection, the issues in dispute will be submitted to an Independent
Accountant for resolution, with instructions to the Independent Accountant to
determine the Companys and its Subsidiaries combined Adjusted EBITDA in
accordance with the definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement.
If issues in dispute are submitted to the Independent Accountant for
resolution, ( _a_ ) each of Parent and the Sellers Representative will
furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents
and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountant
may request and are available to it and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Independent Accountant any material relating to the
determination and to discuss the determination with the
Independent Accountant; ( _b_ ) the determination by the Independent
Accountant of Adjusted EBITDA, as set forth in a written notice delivered to
Parent and the Sellers Representative by the Independent Accountant, will be
binding and conclusive on the parties absent manifest error; and ( _c_ )
the Surviving Corporation and the Sellers Representative shall pay the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant in connection with such
determination, _provided_  that the respective portions of such fees to be
borne by the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative, on the other hand, shall be determined by the Independent
Accountant based on the percentage that the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such
party, and the fees payable by the Shareholders shall be deducted from the
Earnout Payment. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The Company shall maintain
records during Year One, Year Two and Year Three sufficient to allow the
Shareholders and the Parent to verify all calculations relevant to the
Earnout Payments.

Sellers Representative does not object to the Annual Income Statement
pursuant to Section 1.7(a), within forty-five (45) calendar days following
the last day of Year One, Year Two or Year Three, as applicable, ( _B_ ) if
Parent has not performed its obligations under Section 1.7(a) with respect to
the timely delivery of the Annual Income Statement, then on or before the
thirtieth (30th) calendar day following Sellers Representatives receipt of
the Annual Income Statement, unless Sellers Representative objects to the

Annual Income Statement pursuant to Section 1.7(a) hereof, then three (3)
Business Days after the Independent Accountants determination.

  



  

(ii) The first $7.5 million of any amount due under Section 1.7(b) shall be
paid in cash by wire transfer or other immediately available funds to such
account as shall be designated in writing by each Shareholder and Company
Option holder to Parent; and the remainder of such Year One Earnout Payment
shall be paid in a combination of Parent Stock (with the number of shares to
be calculated as provided below) and cash in such relative proportion as the
board of directors of Parent shall determine; provided, however, that to the
extent that Parent pays more than $5 million (such excess, the " _Excess
Stockholder Payments_ ") to holders of IPO Shares upon exercise of their
rights to convert such IPO Shares into cash in accordance with Article Fifth
of the Parent Certificate of Incorporation (" _Dissenting Parent
Stockholders_ "), then, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may reduce the
amount of cash payable pursuant to the Year One Earnout Payment (and
correspondingly increase the number of shares of Parent Stock) by an amount
not exceeding the amount of the Excess Stockholder Payments.

  



  

(iii) The first $5 million of any amount due under Section 1.7(c) shall be
paid in cash by wire transfer or other immediately available funds to such
account as shall be designated in writing by each Shareholder and Company
Option holder to Parent; the next $5.0 million of such Year Two earnout
payment shall be paid fifty percent (50%) in Parent Stock (with the number of
shares to be calculated as provided below) and fifty percent (50%) in cash;
and the remainder of such Year Two Earnout Payment shall be paid in a
combination of Parent Stock (with the number of shares to be calculated as
provided below) and cash in such relative proportions as the board of
directors shall determine; provided, however, that to the extent that Parent
makes Excess Stockholder Payments and does not cover such excess from the
reduction in cash permitted by Section 1.7(e)(ii), then, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may reduce the amount of cash payable pursuant to the Year
Two Earnout Payment (and correspondingly increase the number of shares of
Parent Stock) by an amount not exceeding the excess, if any, of (x) the
Excess Stockholder Payment over (y) the amount by which cash payments

Section 1.7(e)(ii).

  



  

(iv) The first $5 million of any amount due under Section 1.7(d) shall be

Payment shall be paid fifty percent (50%) in Parent Stock (with the number of
shares to be calculated as provided below) and fifty percent (50%) in cash;
and the remainder of such Year Three Earnout Payment shall be paid in a
combination of Parent Stock (with the number of shares to be calculated as
provided below) and cash in such relative proportions as the board of
directors shall determine.

  



  

(v) For the purpose of determining the number of shares of Parent Stock to be
delivered pursuant to this Section 1.7, the Parent Stock shall be valued
based on the average weighted closing price of Parent Stock on the American

Parent Stock is then traded) for the twenty (20) trading day period ending on
the last American Stock Exchange (or such other national securities exchange)
trading day of Year One, Year Two or Year Three, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, **** Parent may,
in its sole discretion, pay all or any portion of an Earnout Payment in cash
rather than in shares of Parent Stock; _provided, however_ , that in the
event Parent consummates a transaction in which all of the stockholders of
Parent receive cash in exchange for their shares of Parent Stock, then all
Earnout Payments due to be paid subsequent to the consummation of such
transaction shall be paid solely in cash.

  



  

(vi) The amount of the Earnout Payment, if any, payable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock and each share of Company Common Stock
underlying a Company Option shall be determined by dividing the applicable
Earnout Payment by the Aggregate Company Shares and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock that are underlying all Company Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(vii) The shares of Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to this Section 1.7
shall be adjusted appropriately if, during the period commencing on the date
that is twenty (20) trading days before the end of Year One, Year Two or Year
Three, as applicable, and ending on the date such shares are actually issued
and delivered to Shareholders, Parent ( _i_ ) effects any dividend
payable in shares of Parent Stock or any other class of Equity Securities; (
_ii_ ) splits or combines the outstanding shares of Parent Stock; ( _iii_ )
effects any reorganization or reclassification of Parent Stock or any other
class of Equity Securities; or ( _iv_ ) fixes a record date for
the determination of shareholders entitled to any of the foregoing. No
fractional shares of Parent Stock will be issued under this Section 1.7 and
any fractional shares will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number
of shares to avoid the issuance of fractional shares (a fractional share of
0.5 or more will be rounded up; less than 0.5 will be rounded down).
The issuance of shares of Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to Section
1.7 hereof shall be duly registered under the Securities Act, and subject to
the extent applicable to Rule 145 restrictions as promulgated under
the Securities Act.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) _Protective Provisions_.

  



  

(i) The Parties acknowledge that the right to receive the Earnout Payments
described in this Section 1.7 is an integral part of the consideration to be
received by the Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Parent agrees that, ( _x_ ) until the Year
Three Earnout Payment is determined, Parent shall not take any actions, or

of such person.

  



  

(c) cause the collective business activities of the Company to be accounted

maintained or contributed to, any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

  



  

(ii) None of the Company nor any Related Person with respect to the Company
has been involved in any transaction that could cause the Company or,
following the Closing Date, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to
be subject to liability under section 4069 or 4212 of ERISA. None of the
Company or any Related Person with respect to the Company has
incurred (either directly or indirectly, including as a result of an

of ERISA or the penalty, excise Tax or joint and several liability provisions
of the Code relating to employee benefit plans, and no event, transaction or
condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result

contributions and premiums required to have been paid by the Company or any
Related Person with respect to the Company to any Company Benefit Plan under
the terms of any such plan or its related trust, insurance contract or other
funding arrangement, or pursuant to any applicable Law (including ERISA and

potential audit or examination) by the IRS, the Department of Labor, or any
other Governmental Authority, domestic or foreign, and no matters are pending
with respect to a Company Benefit Plan under the IRSs Employee Plans
Compliance Resolution Program, or other similar programs of a state or local
Governmental Authority.

(v) The Company has no liability in respect of post-retirement health,
medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees
of the Company except as required to avoid excise tax under section 4980B of
the Code.

  



        
   

  



  

(vi) Except as set forth in Section 2.20(c)(vi) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not (alone or in combination with any other event)
result in an increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or the
acceleration of the vesting or timing of payment of any compensation or
benefits payable to or in respect of any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of the Company or any increased or
accelerated funding obligation or the forgiveness of indebtedness with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, or impose restrictions or limitations on
the Companys rights to administer, amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan. No payment or deemed payment by the Company will arise or be made as a
result (alone or in combination with any other event or payment) of the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company, or the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that would not be deductible pursuant to section 280G of the Code.
No person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including, without
limitation, any tax gross-up or other payment) from the Company or any other
person as a result of the imposition of the excise tax required by section
4999(a) of the Code.

  



  

(vii) Each person who has received compensation for the performance of
services on behalf of the Company has been properly classified as an employee
or independent contractor in accordance with applicable Law and each Company
Benefit Plan has complied with the "leased employee" provisions of the Code.

  



  

(viii) Except as set forth in Section 2.20(c)(viii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and
any award thereunder has been operated since January 1, 2005 based upon a
good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and
any authority required or permitted to be relied upon thereunder,
including, without limitation, _(x_ ) the proposed regulations issued
thereunder, ( _y_ ) the final regulations issued thereunder or ( _z_ )
Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1.

  



  

Section 2.21 _Tax Matters_. Except as set forth in Section 2.21 of the
Company Disclosure Letter:

  



  

(a) The Company has ( _i_ ) duly and timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects and
( _ii_ ) duly and timely paid in full all material Taxes (whether or not
reflected on such Tax Returns) required to be paid by or with respect to it,
or that could give rise to a Lien on its assets.

  



  

(b) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets or properties of the Company
except for Permitted Liens.

  



  

(c) The Company has duly and timely withheld all Taxes required to be
withheld and has duly and timely paid over to the proper Governmental
Authority all such amounts (or such amounts have been withheld and paid over
on its behalf) under all applicable Laws.

  



  

(d) Section 2.21(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
the states, territories and jurisdictions in which the Company is currently
filing, or has filed during the past three years, any income, franchise,
sales or use Tax Return. The Company has made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of ( _i_ ) all such Tax Returns (including any amendments
thereto) filed on or prior to the date hereof for each taxable year beginning
on or after January 1, 2004 and ( _ii_ ) all examination reports, notices of
proposed adjustments and statements of deficiencies, if any, relating to the
audit of such Tax Returns by any Governmental Authority, for each tax year
beginning on or after January 1, 2001.

  



  

(e) All accounting entries (including charges and accruals) for Taxes with
respect to the Company reflected on the books of the Company are adequate to
cover any material Tax liabilities accruing through the end of the last
period for which the Company ordinarily records items on its books and were
properly accrued in accordance with GAAP. Since the end of the last period
for which the Company ordinarily records items on its books, the Company has
not engaged in any transaction, or taken any other action, other than in the
ordinary course of business, that would reasonably be expected to result in a
materially increased Tax liability or materially reduced Tax Asset.

  



  

(f) All Tax Returns with respect to Tax years of the Company through the Tax
year ended December 31, 2006 have been filed, and an extension until
September 15, 2008 for the Tax Return for the Companys Tax year ended
December 31, 2007 has been filed. No written agreement or other document
waiving or extending, or having the effect of waiving or extending, the
statute of limitations or the period of assessment or collection of any Taxes
of or with respect to the Company, and no written power of attorney
with respect to any such Taxes has been filed or entered into with any

  



        
   

  



  

Governmental Authority. The time for filing any Tax Return with respect to
the Company, other than the Tax Return for the Companys Tax year ended
December 31, 2007, has not been extended to a date later than the date of
this Agreement. No Taxes of or with respect to the Company are currently
under audit, examination or investigation by any Governmental Authority.  No
jurisdiction in which the Company does not file a Tax Return has made a claim
that the Company is required to file a Tax Return for such jurisdiction. No
Governmental Authority has asserted or threatened to assert any deficiency,
claim or issue with respect to Taxes or any adjustment to Taxes against the
Company with respect to any taxable period for which the period of assessment
or collection remains open. No circumstances exist to form the basis for
asserting or raising such claim or issue. No adjustment that would materially
increase the Tax liability, or materially reduce any Tax Asset, of the
Company has been made, proposed or threatened by a Governmental Authority
during any audit of any taxable period which would reasonably be expected to
be made, proposed or threatened in an audit of any subsequent taxable period.
All elections and methods of accounting as utilized in the Tax Returns are
currently valid.

  



  

(g) The Company ( _i_ ) has not received or applied for a Tax ruling or

_ii_ ) is not or has not been a member of any affiliated federal, state,
local or foreign, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group for

transferee or successor, pursuant to any tax allocation, sharing or indemnity
agreement or other contractual agreements, or otherwise).

  



  

(h) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date, as a result of any ( _i_ )
change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date under section 481 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state, local or foreign income Tax law), ( _ii_ ) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date or ( _iii_ )
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date. The Company has not
participated in any "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(1).

  



  

(i) The Company has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
section 355 of the Code ( _i_ ) in the two years prior to the date of this
Agreement or ( _ii_ ) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute part
of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the transactions described in
this Agreement.

  



  

(j) The Company is not, and has not been, ( _i_ ) a United States real
property holding corporation (as defined in section 897(c)(2) of the Code)

lists, and Sellers have made available to Parent complete copies of,
all insurance policies (including fidelity bonds and other similar
instruments) relating to the Assets, the Business or the employees, officers
or directors of the Company. There is no material claim by or with respect
to the Company pending under any of such policies as to which coverage has
been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or
in respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights. All
premiums payable under such policies have been timely paid, and Sellers and
the Company have otherwise complied in all material respects with the terms
and conditions of such policies. Such policies (or other policies providing
substantially similar insurance coverage) have been in effect continuously
since January 1 of the third calendar year preceding the Balance Sheet Date
**** and remain in full force and effect. Such policies are of the type and
in amounts customarily carried by Persons conducting businesses similar to
those of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. The Company does not
know of any threatened termination of, premium increase with respect to, or
alteration of coverage under, any of such policies.

  



  

Section 2.23 _Customers and Suppliers_.

  



  

(a) Section 2.23(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies ( _a_ ) the
Companys top 10 (ranked by volume of sales) customers (including Affiliates

_b_ ) the amount of purchases by each such customer during such periods.
Except as described in Section 2.23(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor Sellers have received any notice or have any reason
to believe that any such customer ( _i_ ) has materially reduced or will
materially reduce, the use of products or services of the Company, or ( _ii_
) has sought to reduce the price it will pay for

  



        
   

  



  

products or services of the Company, including in each case as a result of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

  



  

(b) Section 2.23(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies ( _a_ ) the
Companys top 10 (ranked by volume of purchases) suppliers (including any
Affiliates of Sellers) from which the Company, individually or in the
aggregate, ordered raw materials, supplies or other products or services
during the two most recently ended fiscal years of the Company and ( _b_ )
the amount of purchases from each such supplier during such periods.  Since
the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any material adverse change in the
terms and conditions of sale of such raw materials, supplies or other
products or services, and the Company and the Sellers have no Knowledge that
there will be such change (other than general and customary price increases
and other market driven changes) after the Closing Date including as a result
of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

  



  

Section 2.24 _Finders  Fees_. Except for Near Earth LLC, whose fees
and expenses will be paid by the Company, there is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary retained by or authorized to act on
behalf of Sellers or the Company who might be entitled to any fee or
commission from Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the

Company) or other transaction between the Company and the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates (other than the Company), except, with respect to the period
prior to the date of this Agreement, in the ordinary course of business of

Section 2.25(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(b) Section 2.25(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all agreements,
arrangements and other commitments or transactions to or by which the
Company, on the one hand, and any Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than

_ii_ ) are currently pending or in effect or ( _iii_ ) involve continuing
liabilities or obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, have been
or will be material to the Company (each, an " _Affiliate Transaction_ ").
Each Affiliate Transaction was on terms and conditions no more favorable to
the Company than as would have been obtainable by them at the time in a
comparable arms-length transaction with a Person other than a Seller or any
of its Affiliates.  Except as set forth in Section 2.25(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no stockholder, officer, director or employee of

untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements of the Parent included in the Parent SEC

regulations of the Commission with respect thereto as in effect at the time
of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with

respects the financial position of the Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and the results of

Parent.

  



  

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. There is no action, claim, suit or

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Merger Sub has no assets or properties of any kind, does not now
conduct and has never conducted any business, and has and will have at the
Closing no obligations or liabilities of any nature whatsoever except such
obligations and liabilities as are imposed under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.13 _Employee Benefit Plans_. Except as set forth in Section 4.13

arranged through the responsible officers of the Company designated for such

shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Sellers or the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) After the Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates shall hold, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in

information concerning the Company, except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been ( _i_ ) previously known on a
nonconfidential basis by Sellers, ( _ii_ ) in the public domain through no
fault of Sellers or their Affiliates or ( _iii_ ) later lawfully acquired by
Sellers from sources other than those related to its prior ownership of the

on the other hand; _provided_ that ( _i_ ) such books and records are
material to such audit, investigation, dispute or Litigation, ( _ii_ ) the
information contained in such books and records is not available from the
Company and ( _iii_ ) any such access by Parent shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Sellers. Parent shall keep such

extent that such information can be shown to have been ( _i_ )
previously known on a nonconfidential basis by Parent, ( _ii_ ) in the
public domain through no fault of Parent or its Affiliates or ( _iii_ )
received on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or
Sellers, provided that such source is not known to Parent to be subject to
a contractual, legal, fiduciary or other obligation of confidentiality with
respect to such information. In the event that Parent becomes legally
compelled (by deposition, interrogatory request for documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such
information, Parent may disclose such information to the extent legally
required; provided, however, that ( _a_ ) the Company and/or Sellers, as
applicable, are first notified of such legal process, unless such notice is
prohibited by law or court order, ( _b_ ) Parent attempts to obtain the
Companys and/or Sellers (as applicable) consent to such disclosure, and (
_c_ ) at the Companys and/or Sellers (as applicable) request, Parent shall

deliver to Parent, monthly financial statements, to be in scope and detail
consistent with the monthly financial statements that have been historically
prepared by the Company and delivered to Sellers.

Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after receipt by Parent from the
Company of all financial and other information relating to the Company as
Parent may reasonably request for its preparation, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC under the Exchange Act a Registration Statement on Form S-4
(or such other appropriate form) containing ( _a_ ) a Proxy Statement for
the purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of Parent Stock to vote in
favor of (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ ") ( _i_ ) the approval of
the Merger, ( _ii_ ) the Parent Charter Amendment, ( _iii_ ) issuance of the
Total Merger Consideration to the Shareholders, and ( _iv_ ) the adoption of
an equity compensation plan at a meeting of holders of Parent Stock to be
called and held for such purpose (the " _Special Meeting_ ") and ( _b_ )
a prospectus relating to the shares of Parent Stock to be issued to
the Shareholders at the Closing and pursuant to Section 1.7. The Company and
the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent all
information concerning the Company as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement. The Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to
review and comment on such Registration Statement and such Proxy Statement,
including amendments thereto, prior to their filing with the SEC and Parent
will not file any documents containing information that the Company has
reasonably determined is incorrect or misleading and notified Parent in
writing thereof. Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to any SEC comments on such
Registration Statement and such Proxy Statement and shall otherwise use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective and the definitive Proxy Statement to be approved by the SEC for
distribution to the Parents stockholders as promptly as

  



        
   

  



  

reasonably practicable. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
make senior management of the Company reasonably available for customary
"roadshow" presentations. Parent shall also take any and all such actions to
satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The
Company and the Sellers shall cooperate with Parent in the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto.

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable following the approval by the SEC of the
distribution of the definitive Proxy Statement, Parent shall distribute the
Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Stock and, pursuant thereto, shall
call the Special Meeting in accordance with the DGCL and in no event more
than sixty (60) days following approval by the SEC of the Proxy Statement
and, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, solicit proxies from
such holders to vote in favor of the approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other matters presented for approval
or adoption at the Special Meeting.

  



  

(c) Parent shall comply with all applicable provisions of and rules under the
Exchange Act and all applicable provisions of the DGCL in the preparation and
filing of the Registration Statement, the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of proxies thereunder,
and the calling and holding of the Special Meeting. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall ensure that the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement do not, as of the date on which the Registration Statement
is declared effective and the date on which the Proxy Statement is
first distributed to the stockholders of Parent, and as of the date of the
Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (
_provided_ that Parent shall not be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information relating to the Company or any other
information furnished by the Company or the Sellers for inclusion in the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement). The Company and the Sellers
shall ensure that the information relating to the Company supplied by the
Company and the Sellers for inclusion in the Registration Statement and
the Proxy Statement will not, as of the date on which the Registration
Statement is declared effective and the date on which the Proxy Statement is
first distributed to the stockholders of Parent or at the time of the
Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  



  

(d) Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of its board of directors that the holders of
Parent Stock vote in favor of the approval of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Parent Stockholder Approval.

  



  

(e) The Company also shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best
efforts to provide all information reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any application or other filing made to maintain or secure
listing for trading or quotation of Parent Stock on the American Stock
Exchange (or on such other national exchange or quotation service in which
Parent Stock is trading or quoted) following the Closing.

  



  

(f) To the extent that ( _i_ ) Parent reasonably determines, after discussion
with the Sellers Representative, that the registration of Parent Stock on
Form S-4, as provided in this Section 5.6, is not feasible or may not be
completed on or prior to the Closing Date because it would violate any
applicable law or applicable interpretations of the SECs staff or ( _ii_ )
such registration does not enable the recipient of Parent Stock so registered
on Form S-4 to re-sell (following the expiration of any applicable lock-up
periods pursuant to a Lock-Up Letter) the shares of Parent Stock so
registered free of resale restrictions under Rule 144 under the Securities
Act, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be filed and to have
such declared effective by the SEC ( _w_ ) in the case of clause (i) above,
as soon as practicable after the Closing Date or ( _x_ ) in the case of
clause (ii) above, as soon as practicable following the expiration of any
applicable lock-up periods pursuant to a Lock-Up Letter, a shelf registration
statement on an appropriate form under Rule 415 under the Securities Act, or
any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC, providing for the sale of
all the Parent Stock by ( _y_ ) in the case of clause (i) above, the Persons
that were the intended recipients of Parent Stock registered on Form S-4 or (
_z_ ) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Persons who are so subject to
resale restrictions.

prepare all press releases and public announcements pertaining to this
Agreement and the transactions governed by it, and no party shall issue or
otherwise make any public announcement or communication pertaining to

consent of Parent (in the case of the Company or the Sellers) or the Company
(in the case of Parent), except as required by applicable Law or by the rules
and regulations of, or pursuant to, any agreement of a stock exchange or
trading system. Each Party will not unreasonably withhold approval from the
others with respect to any press release or public announcement. If any Party
determines with the advice of counsel that it is required to make this
Agreement and the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby public or
otherwise issue a press release or make public disclosure with respect
thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making any public disclosure,
consult with the other party regarding such

  



        
   

  



  

disclosure, seek such confidential treatment for such terms or portions of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably
requested by the other party and disclose only such information as is legally
compelled to be disclosed. This provision will not apply to communications
by any Party to its counsel, accountants and other professional advisors.

sending a termination letter to the Trustee.  Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information and the preservation of any
applicable attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, self-audit
privilege or other similar privilege, each of the Parties shall have the
right to review and comment on in advance, and to the extent practicable each
will consult the other on, all the information relating to such party that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing right,
each of the Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  



  

(b) If required pursuant to the HSR Act, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall each prepare and file

is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,

Director and Officer Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer,

and officers liability insurance policies on terms not less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an aggregate
amount, during such six year period that would be more than 200% of the 2008
annual premiums paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, _multiplied_
 by six (6), to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto.

  



  

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with

Agreement_. The Company and the Sellers acknowledge that, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated by Parent by October 24,
2008, Parent will be obligated to return to its stockholders the amounts
being held in the Trust Fund. Accordingly, the Company and the Sellers hereby
waive all rights to collect from the Trust Fund any moneys that may be owed
to them by Parent for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or any negotiations, agreements
or understandings with Parent, and will not seek recourse against the Trust

Section 5.17 _Employee Matters_. From and after the Closing Date, employees
of the Company on the Closing Date (the " _Employees_ ") shall continue their
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries. During the period commencing
on the Closing Date and ending on the six-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide Employees with compensation opportunities and
benefits (other than equity-based incentive opportunities and any change in
control or special compensation arrangement related to the transactions
contemplated herein) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those provided to the Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor all Company Benefit Plans and
compensation agreements and arrangements in accordance with its terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, unless or until any such
Company Benefit Plan is amended or terminated in accordance with its terms by
Parent or the Company. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: ( _i_ )
shall be treated as an establishment, amendment, or modification of any
Company Benefit Plan, ( _ii_ ) shall alter or limit Parents or the Companys
ability to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, ( _iii_ ) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to

particular term or condition of employment, or ( _iv_ ) is intended to confer
upon any individual (including, but not limited to, employees, retirees, or
dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. Parent agrees that the Surviving
Corporation shall be responsible for providing all legally-mandated
continuation coverage for Employees and their covered dependents who
experience a loss of coverage due to a "qualifying event" (within the

  



        
   

  



  

meaning of section 603 of ERISA) which occurs at any time on or after the

within the applicable time periods, elect continuation coverage.

  



  

Section 5.18 _Work For Hire_. The Company shall use its commercially

failure to file on a timely basis, and ( _iv_ ) such other information as
the Company and Parent shall reasonably agree to include in such letter (the

ARTICLE 6 
 Tax Matters

  



  

Section 6.1 _Sellers  Responsibility for Taxes_.  Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall bear
and pay, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless each of Parent, its
Affiliates, the Company and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisers and representatives for, from and against any and all
liabilities for Taxes (or payments in respect of Taxes) that ( _i_ ) are
imposed on, allocated or attributable to or incurred or payable by the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, ( _ii_ ) arise under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of U.S. state,
local or foreign Law or under principles of transferee or successor liability
or by contract, or ( _iii_ ) arise from or are attributable to any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 2.21, in each
of the above cases, together with any out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred in
connection therewith, but only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the
Companys accrued and unpaid liability for Taxes payable set forth on the
Companys financial statements as of the Closing Date (in accordance with
GAAP and consistent with past custom and practice of the Company), _provided_
that any such amounts accrued on the financial statements shall be reflected
in the calculations of Net Working Capital for purposes of determining
indemnification obligations with respect to Net Working Capital.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of Section 6.1, any liability
for Taxes attributable to a taxable period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be apportioned between the
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning
on the day after the Closing Date ( _x_ ) in the case of real and personal
property Taxes, by apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and ( _y_ ) in
the case of income Taxes and all other Taxes, on the basis of a closing of
the books as of the end of the Closing Date. The Company shall be responsible
for preparing the Tax Return (or portion thereof) for that portion of the
Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date, and Parent shall be
responsible for preparing the Tax Return (or portion thereof) for
that portion of the Straddle Period that begins on the day after the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Post-Closing Date Losses_. For purposes of the Sellers
obligations under Section 6.1, the Company shall be deemed not to have the
benefit of any item of loss, deduction or credit or any net operating loss,
net capital loss or other tax credit or benefit that is attributable
to, arises from or relates to any taxable period (or portion thereof)
commencing after the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Tax Returns; Dispute Resolutions_. Except as provided in
Section 6.2, Sellers Representative shall be responsible for preparing all
Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, other than Tax Returns ( _i_ ) in respect of any Straddle
Period or ( _ii_ ) that are required to be filed after the Closing, and
Parent shall be responsible

  



        
   

  



  

for preparing and filing all other Tax Returns with respect to the Company.
Each of Sellers Representative and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to make any Tax Returns and work papers in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period for which such party is responsible for preparing available for review
by the other party sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such
Tax Returns to provide such other party with a meaningful opportunity to
analyze, comment on and dispute such Tax Returns and for such Tax Returns to
be modified, as appropriate, before filing. Subject to the remainder of this
Section 6.4, Parent shall obtain Sellers Representatives consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, prior to
filing any Tax Return in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period if any such Tax
Return may be reasonably expected to result in liability for Sellers for
indemnification for Taxes under this Article 6 or otherwise impose liability
upon the Shareholders. In the event of any disagreement between Parent and
Sellers with respect to any such Tax Returns or any other matter regarding
Taxes covered by this Article 6, such disagreement shall be resolved by an
accounting firm of international reputation mutually agreeable to Sellers
Representative and Parent (the " _Tax Accountant_ "), and any such
determination by the Tax Accountant shall be final. The fees and expenses of
the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by Parent and Sellers.
 Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, if the
Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences between Sellers and Parent
with respect to such Tax Return at least five days prior to the due date
therefor, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the party having
the responsibility hereunder for preparing such Tax Return and amended to
reflect the Tax Accountants resolution. The preparation and filing of any
Tax Return that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
exclusively within the control of Parent.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Tax Contests_. Parent shall promptly notify Sellers
Representative in writing upon receipt by the Company, or by Parent or any of
its Affiliates, of notice of any Tax audits, examinations or assessments that
could give rise to a liability for which Sellers are responsible under
Section 6.1 of this Agreement.  Sellers Representative shall control the
conduct and disposition of the portion of any such audit, examination or
proceeding that relates to any Taxes for which Sellers are responsible,
provided that Sellers Representative shall not settle or compromise any such
audit, examination or proceeding without the consent of Parent. Parent shall
control the conduct and disposition of any audit, examination or proceeding
(or portion thereof) that does not relate to Taxes for which Sellers are
responsible under Section 6.1.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Each of Parent and Sellers
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) ( _i_ ) provide the
other party and its Affiliates with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or
any audit or other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Taxes and ( _ii_ ) retain (and provide
the other party and its Affiliates with reasonable access to) all records or
information which may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination or
proceeding, provided that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not
to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including any real property transfer tax and any similar
Tax) (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid by Sellers when due, and
Sellers will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable law, Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Overlap_. In case of any inconsistency between this Article
6 and any other provision of this Agreement, this Article 6 shall
control over such other provision with respect to Tax matters. To the extent
that an obligation or responsibility pursuant to Article 9 may overlap with
an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this Article 6, the provisions of
this Article 6 shall govern such obligation or responsibility; _provided_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that the Sellers indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Article 6 may be satisfied (at Parents election) from the
Escrow Fund. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, none of the limitations on indemnification
contained in Sections 9.1 and 9.4 shall apply to damages in respect of Tax
matters covered in this Article 6. No provision of this Article 6 shall apply
until immediately after the Closing.

(f) No party to this Agreement (or any of its Affiliates) shall, in any

Affiliates) for any punitive damages of such other party (or any of its

Section 9.5 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_. In the case of any Litigation
asserted by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against a party
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_
"), notice shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the party required to
provide indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after
such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of such Third-Party Claim, and
the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of
such Indemnifying Party) to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
_provided_  that ( _a_ ) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct
the defense of such Third-Party Claim shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at such Indemnified Partys expense, and ( _b_ ) the failure of
any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this
Agreement except to the extent that such failure results in a lack of actual
notice to the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice.  If the Indemnifying
Party does not promptly assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim
following notice thereof, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume
and control such defense and to settle or agree to pay in full such Third-
Party Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
approve any settlement in which the Indemnified Party has not secured a
complete general release relating to such Third-Party Claim, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim, shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief
affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified
Party of an irrevocable release from all liability with respect to such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party in good faith determines that the
conduct of the defense or any proposed settlement of any Third-Party Claim
would reasonably be expected to affect adversely the Indemnified Partys Tax
liability or the ability of the Company to conduct its business, or that the
Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times

  



        
   

  



  

to take over and control the defense, settlement, negotiation or
Litigation relating to any such Third-Party Claim at the sole cost of the
Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that if the Indemnified Party does so take
over and control, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third-Party
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, Seller and Parent
shall cooperate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim subject to this
Article 9 and the records of each shall be reasonably available to the other
with respect to such defense.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Parties agree that
any indemnity payments pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration, unless otherwise

Section 11.3 _Sellers  Representative_.

  



  

(a) Philip Shou shall be and he hereby is appointed as agent and attorney-in-
fact (the " _Sellers  Representative_") for each Seller signing this
Agreement (each a " _Signing Seller_ ") as of the date hereof and for each
other Shareholder (except such stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected
their appraisal rights under the GBCC) (each a " _Non-Signing Seller_ "),
with full power of substitution to irrevocably act in the name, place and
stead of such Shareholder with respect to the transfer of such Shareholders
Company Shares to the Parent and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, all in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and to irrevocably act on behalf of such Shareholder in any amendment of or
Litigation involving this Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to execute all such documents, as such Sellers
Representative in his sole and absolute discretion shall deem necessary or
appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the power:

  



  

(i) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver
of any condition to the obligations of the Signing Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all Ancillary Agreements, statements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be
given in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (it being understood that such Signing Seller shall execute
and deliver any such documents which the Sellers Representative agrees to
execute);

  



  

(iii) to terminate this Agreement if the Signing Sellers are entitled to do
so;

  



  

(iv) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection
with any claims under this Agreement, including service of process in
connection with any Litigation;

  



  

(v) to make any decisions or agreements to make or acknowledge any
indemnification payments of the Sellers; and

  



  

(vi) to take all actions which under this Agreement may be taken by the
Shareholders and to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on
behalf of any Shareholder that the Sellers Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in his sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement as fully and completely as any such Shareholder could do if
personally present.

  



  

(b) The Person serving as Sellers Representative may be changed by the
Shareholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Parent; _provided_  that the Sellers Representative may
not be removed unless holders of an aggregate of two-thirds interest in the
Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Shares agree to such removal and to the identity
of the substituted agent. Any vacancy in the position of
Sellers Representative may be filled by approval of the holders of a
majority in interest in the Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Shares. No bond shall
be required of the Sellers Representative, and the Sellers Representative
shall

  



        
   

  



  

not receive compensation for his or her services.  Notices or communications
to or from the Sellers Representative shall constitute notice to or from
each of the Shareholders.

  



  

(c) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Sellers Representative in good faith, absent gross
negligence. The Sellers shall severally indemnify the Sellers Representative
and hold the Sellers Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Sellers Representatives
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Sellers Representative.  The Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to recover such fees and expenses from any
proceeds otherwise distributable to the Sellers Representative or the
Shareholders out of the cash held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative
shall constitute a decision of all the Shareholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Shareholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent
may rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each such Shareholder.
The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Governing Law, Etc._

  



  

(a) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA MANDATORILY
APPLY, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING AS TO
VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, TO THE
EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND
WOULD PERMIT OR REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
Parent and Sellers hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of New York and the federal courts of the United States
of America located in the State, City and County of New York solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each of Parent and
Sellers hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereby or of any such document or in respect of
any such transaction, that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts.

  



  

Section 11.5 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that except as permitted below,
this Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Sellers, Parent may
transfer or assign (including by way of a pledge), in whole or from time to
time in part, ( _i_ ) to one or more of its Affiliates, its rights and
obligations hereunder or ( _ii_ ) to its lenders or other financing sources
any or all of its rights hereunder (including its rights to seek
indemnification hereunder) as collateral security, _provided_ that no such
transfer or assignment will relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.
 Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement
to Parent shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context
otherwise requires.

  



  

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
(when executed and delivered), and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

  



  

Section 11.7 _Severability_. If any provision, including any
phrase, sentence, clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or
unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of
rendering such provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in
any other case or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein
contained invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.
Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.8 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.  This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the
same instrument. This

  



        
   

  



  

Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties.  Until and unless
each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).  Except as provided under Article 9, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 11.9 _Time of Essence_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that, with
regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

Section 11.10 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult
to determine, if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
a decree of specific performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any
court specified in Section 11.4, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

Section 11.11 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
