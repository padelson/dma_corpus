assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted to Purchaser under this
Agreement, other than in connection with a Permitted Sale (as defined below) or
with the prior written consent of Vendor, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. In determining the reasonableness of any refusal of Vendor
to consent to any proposed assignment or transfer, the following factors shall,
without limitation, be considered: (i)&nbsp;the extent to which the proposed
assignee is a direct competitor of Vendor; (ii)&nbsp;the extent to which the rights
purported to be transferred or assigned could be used by the proposed assignee
to adversely affect the competitive position of Vendor; (iii)&nbsp;the absence of
reasonable contractual safeguards to ensure that restrictive covenants and
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement will be complied with by the
purported assignee and/or transferee, and (iv)&nbsp;the lack of access by Vendor to
reasonable enforcement rights and remedies for breach of any such restrictive
covenants or confidentiality provisions. The Parties agree that a Permitted
Sale shall not require any Vendor consent hereunder. For the purpose of this
