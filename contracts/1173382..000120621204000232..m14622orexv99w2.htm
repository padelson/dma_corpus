ARTICLE 3   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VENDOR

    

     3.1  |   | Representations and Warranties of Vendor  
---|---|--- 
     

 Vendor represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows and acknowledges and confirms that Purchaser is relying upon such representations and warranties in connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement:   

     (a)  |   | Incorporation and Qualification. Each of the Vendor
Parties and CAE UK is a corporation duly incorporated, organized, validly
subsisting and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its material properties and to carry on the Business as now
being conducted by it and is duly registered, licensed or qualified to carry
on the Business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the Business as
now being conducted by it or the property owned or leased by it makes
such registration, licensing or qualification necessary, unless failure to
be so registered or qualified would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (b)  |   | Authority and Enforceability. Each of the CAE Vendors and
CAE UK has the requisite corporate power and authority and has received all
necessary corporate approvals to enter into the Transaction Documents to
which they are a party and to complete the transactions contemplated thereby.
This Agreement has been, and the other Transaction Documents will be on
or prior to Closing, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Vendor (and any other of the CAE Vendors or CAE UK that is a party thereto,
as the case may be) and shall constitute a valid and binding obligation
of such CAE Vendor and CAE UK, enforceable against it in accordance
with their respective terms, subject, however, to limitations with respect
to enforcement imposed by Law in connection with bankruptcy, arrangement
or similar proceedings, the equitable power of the courts to stay
proceedings before them and the execution of judgements and to the extent
that equitable remedies such as specific performance and injunction are in
the discretion of the court from which they are sought.  
      
    (c)  |   | No Conflict. The execution and delivery of, and the
performance by CAE Vendors and CAE UK of their obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which they are party will not:  
     

     (i)  |   | result in a breach of any provision of the memorandum
or articles of association, by-laws or any other constating documents of the
Vendor Parties or CAE UK;  
---|---|--- 
      
    (ii)  |   | except as disclosed in Section 3.1(c) of the
Disclosure Letter or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a Material Adverse Effect, result in a breach of, or constitute a default
or give rise to a right of termination or acceleration under any contract or
instrument to which any Vendor Party or CAE UK is a party or by which any
Vendor Party or CAE UK or any of the Transferred Interests or any assets of
any Corporation is bound and which would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;  
     ##### 

  

   

     (iii)  |   | except as disclosed in Section 3.1(c) of the
Disclosure Letter, or where such breach or termination relates to or
arises specifically as a result of the identity of Purchaser and is
unknown to the Vendor or except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, result in a breach of,
or cause the termination or revocation of, any Authorization to which any
Vendor Party is a party or by which any Vendor Party or CAE UK or any of the
Transferred Interests or any assets of any Corporation is bound;  
---|---|--- 
      
    (iv)  |   | save as contemplated specifically by this Agreement
and Section 3.1(c)(iv) of the Disclosure Letter and except where
such failure relates to or arises specifically as a result of the identity
of Purchaser and is unknown to the Vendor, require any CAE Vendor or CAE UK
to obtain any consent or approval of, or give any notice to or make any
registration or filing with, any Governmental Entity which has not been
obtained or made at the date of this Agreement, where failure to obtain any
such consent or approval, give any such notice or make any such registration
or filing could have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect; or  
      
    (v)  |   | except as disclosed in Section 3.1(c)(v) of the
Disclosure Letter, result in the material violation of any Law.  
     

     (d)  |   | Capital Structure; the Business. Section 3.1(d) of the
Disclosure Letter attached hereto sets forth the authorized and the issued
and outstanding share capital of each Corporation and all of such issued and
outstanding  shares or quotas have been duly authorized and issued
as fully paid and non-assessable. No options, warrants or other rights to
purchase shares, quotas or other securities of the Corporations and no
securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable for shares, quotas
or other securities of the Corporations have been authorized or agreed to be
issued or are outstanding. Each Corporation conducts no business or
operations other than the Business, and has no assets or liabilities other
than those relating exclusively to the Business. Each of the Vendor Parties
and CAE UK (other than the Vendor) is a wholly-owned, direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Vendor, other than the UK Companies.  
---|---|--- 
     

     (e)  |   | Title to Purchased Shares. Each Share Vendor is the
sole beneficial and registered owner of the number and class of Purchased
Shares set forth beside its name in Section 2.1(b) of the Disclosure Letter
(as it may be amended as of the Closing Date to reflect changes described in
Section 3.1(d) of the Disclosure Letter), with good and valid title, free
and clear of all Liens other than those restrictions on Transfer, if
any, contained in the articles of the Corporations or in Section 3.1(e) of
the Disclosure Letter. Except as set out in Section 3.1(e) of the
Disclosure Letter, the Share Vendors have the exclusive right to dispose of
the Purchased Shares as provided in this Agreement. Except as set out
in Section 3.1(e) of the Disclosure Letter, upon completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser will have
good and valid title to the Purchased Shares, free and clear of all Liens
other than (i) those restrictions on transfer, if any, contained in the
articles of the Corporations, and (ii) any Liens created by the Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 
     ##### 

  

   

     (f)  |   | No Subsidiaries. The Corporations do not have any
subsidiaries and do not hold any shares or other ownership equity or
proprietary interest in any other Person except as set out in Section 3.1(f)
of the Disclosure Letter. The Vendor and its Affiliates do not own or control
any shares of any corporation that carries on the Business or any corporation
that owns any assets or holds any right relating to the Business, other than
the Asset Vendors and the Corporations, subject to any assets or rights
held directly or indirectly by any of Vendor or its Affiliates in
connection with or relating to any activity which is excluded from the
restrictive covenants of Vendor under Article 12.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (g)  |   | No Other Agreement to Purchase. Except as set out in
Section 3.1(e) of the Disclosure Letter, and except for Purchasers right
under this Agreement, no Person has any written or oral agreement, option or
warrant or any right or privilege (whether by Law, pre-emptive or
contractual) capable of becoming such for, and the Vendor Parties and CAE UK
have not agreed to nor have they authorized, (i) the purchase or acquisition
of any of the Transferred Interests, other than Inventory sold in the
Ordinary Course, or (ii) the purchase, subscription, allotment or issuance
of, or conversion, exercise or exchange of any right or securities into, any
of the unissued shares or other securities (debt or equity) of
the Corporations. Except as set out in Section 3.1(e) of the
Disclosure Letter, the Purchased Shares are not subject to the terms of
any shareholders agreement, voting agreement, proxy or other
similar agreement.  
      
    (h)  |   | Absence of Changes. Since the Financial Statements Date,
and except as disclosed in Section 3.1(h) of the Disclosure Letter, the
Business has been carried on in the Ordinary Course and there has not been
any change in the financial conditions or results of operations of the
Business and the Corporations, except for changes in the Ordinary Course of
the Business, which changes have not had a Material Adverse Effect.
Without limitation, except as disclosed in Section 3.1(h) of the
Disclosure Letter, none of the Vendor Parties has (and for purposes of
paragraphs (viii), (ix), (x) and (xiv) below, neither CAE UK has), in

     (ff)  |   | Tax Matters.  
---|---|---

Agreement, the term "Tax" or, collectively, "Taxes" shall mean any and all
federal, state, provincial, territorial, municipal, local and foreign
taxes, assessments, reassessment and other governmental charges,
duties, impositions and liabilities, including those based upon, measured
by or referred to as gross receipts, income, profits, sales, capital, use
and occupation, goods and services, harmonized sales, use, value-added, ad
valorem, transfer, recordation, stamp, franchise, withholding, payroll,

       |   | services, education, social security, excise and property
taxes, including estimated taxes, all customs duties and import and
export taxes, countervail and anti-dumping, all licenses, franchise
and registration fee and all employment insurance, health insurance
and Canada, Quebec and other governmental pension plan premiums
or contributions, together with all interest, penalties, fines and additions
imposed with respect to such amounts.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (ii)  |   | Computation, Preparation and Payment. Except as set out
in Section 3.1(ff) of the Disclosure Letter, since the dates on which the
Corporations became Affiliated with CAE, each Corporation and each Subsidiary
has timely filed all material federal, state, provincial, municipal, local
and foreign returns, estimates, information statements, elections,
designations, reports and any other related filings ("Tax Returns"), required
to be filed by it and has timely paid or accrued all Taxes which are or may
become due and payable including without limitation all installments on
account of Taxes. Each Tax Return filed by each Corporation, was
complete and correct in all material respects. No Tax Return filed, nor
Taxes payable, by a Corporation is currently the subject of an
audit, action, suit, proceeding, claim, examination, deficiency
or assessment by any Governmental Entity, and no such audit, action, suit,
proceeding, claim, examination, deficiency, or assessment is currently
pending or, to the Vendors knowledge, threatened. No Corporation is
currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return, and no Corporation has waived any statute of limitation with
respect to any Tax or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment, collection of Tax or other deficiency. Except as set out in
Section 3.1(ff) of the Disclosure Letter, none of the Corporations is subject
to any private letter ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or
comparable rulings of any other Tax authority. Purchaser has received
correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns, examination reports,
and statements of deficiencies assessed against, or agreed to by all of the
Corporations for the last three (3) completed fiscal years in respect of
which any taxation authority may assess or otherwise impose Tax on any
Corporation. The unpaid Taxes of the Corporations, including Taxes that are
not yet due and payable, do not exceed the reserves for actual Taxes as
reflected in the financial records of the Business through the Closing Date
in accordance with the past custom and practice of each Corporation in filing
Tax Returns. To the knowledge of the Vendor, no claim is currently pending
or unresolved by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where a Corporation does
not file Tax Returns to the effect that such Corporation is or may be subject
to Tax in that jurisdiction.  
      
    (iii)  |   | Withholdings. Each Corporation has withheld from
each payment made to any of its past and present shareholders,
directors, officers, employees and agents the amount of all Taxes and
other deductions required to be withheld and has paid such amounts, in
the form required under the appropriate legislation, or made
adequate provision for the payment of such amounts to the proper
tax authorities. The amount of Tax withheld but not remitted by Corporations
will be retained in their respective accounts and will be remitted by them to
the appropriate authorities when due.  
     ##### 

  

   

     (iv)  |   | CAE Vendors. To the knowledge of the CAE Vendors,
no failure, if any, of the CAE Vendors to duly and timely pay all Taxes,
including all instalments on account of Taxes for the current year, that are
due and payable by them will result in a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien)
on the Transferred Interests.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (v)  |   | Audits and Proceedings. To the knowledge of the CAE
Vendors, there are no proceedings, audits or Claims now pending or
threatened against the CAE Vendors in respect of any Taxes, and there are
no matters under discussion, audit or appeal with any Governmental Entity
relating to Taxes, which will result in a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien)
on the Transferred Interests.  
      
    (vi)  |   | Taxing Jurisdictions. Section 3.1(ff) of the
Disclosure Letter hereto contains a list of all jurisdictions (whether
foreign or domestic) to which any Tax is properly payable in connection
with the Business geographic locations.

 Subject to Section 8.10 (as concerns the Vendor Pension Plans) and Subsections 8.9(i) and 8.9(j):   

     (a)  |   | The Transferred Employees shall cease to actively
participate in, accrue benefits under or be covered by the Asset Vendors or
CAE UK Employee Plans, as the case may be, as of the Closing Date.  
---|---|--- 
     ##### 

  

   

     (b)  |   | The Purchaser or its Affiliates shall establish or
designate, at its expense, effective as of the Closing Date, employee plans
(the "Purchaser Employee Plans") which will provide the Transferred Employees
with benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to the Transferred Employees by the Asset Vendors or CAE
UK Employee Plans, as the case may be, in effect immediately prior to

after the Closing Date, amend or terminate in whole or in part any
Purchaser Employee Plan, nor shall anything in this Agreement require any
Purchaser Employee Plan to replicate any particular benefit provided under
any Asset Vendors or CAE UK Employee Plan in respect of any Transferred
Employee (or any spouse, beneficiary or dependant of any Transferred
Employee).  
---|---|--- 
      
    (c)  |   | As of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees will
commence active participation in, accrue benefits under and be covered by the

to the Closing Date or which relate to the events prior to the Closing
Date in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable Laws, and the
Asset Vendor and CAE UK, as the case may be, agree to indemnify and hold
the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all
Damages which the Purchaser or its Affiliates may suffer or incur in
connection with such obligations and liabilities.  
      
      |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the Asset Vendors and CAE UK
shall be responsible for the following claims or benefit payments of
all Transferred Employees and former employees involved in the
Business regardless of whether such claims are filed before or after the
Closing Date:  
     

     (i)  |   | with respect to death or dismemberment claims, those
in respect of which the event occurred prior to the Closing Date;

with events occurring prior to the Closing Date, whether or not such claims
continue after the Closing Date.

     (e)  |   | The Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all benefits of the Transferred Employees accrued from and after the
Closing Date or which relate to events occurring after the Closing Date and
the Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold the Vendor harmless from and
against any and all Damages which the Asset Vendors or CAE UK, as the case
may be, may suffer or incur in connection with such benefits.  
---|---|--- 
      
      |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser or its Affiliates
shall be responsible for the following claims or benefit payments of
the Transferred Employees:  
     

     (i)  |   | with respect to death or dismemberment claims, those
in respect of which the event occurred after the Closing Date;  
---|---|--- 
      
    (ii)  |   | with respect to health claims, those in respect of which
the services were provided or the supplies were purchased after the Closing
Date;  
      
    (iii)  |   | with respect to short-term and/or long-term
disability claims and workers compensation claims, for those claims
resulting from events that occurred after the Closing Date, other than
for recurring illnesses described in Section 8.9(d)(iii) above and covered
under the Employee Plans.  
     

     (f)  |   | The Purchaser or its Affiliates will cause the
Purchaser Employee Plans to, or with respect to Transferred Employees in the
U.K., will use reasonable best efforts to, (i) waive requirements of evidence
of insurability, limitations on pre-existing conditions and
eligibility periods for purposes of the Transferred Employees participation
in the Purchaser Employee Plans and (ii) honour any deductible, co-
payments, co-insurance or out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by
such Transferred Employees, including with respect to their covered
dependants, under the Asset Vendors or CAE UK Employee Plans since January 1
of the year of the Closing Date until the Closing Date, as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Purchaser Employee Plans.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (g)  |   | The Purchaser Employee Plans shall recognize years of
employment of the Transferred Employees with the Vendor (and its Affiliates,
or with the Corporations, as applicable) and/or years of service credited to
the Transferred Employees under the Employee Plans for "locking-in"
(solely for Transferred Employees who participate in certain Employee Plans,
as applicable, in Canada) and eligibility and vesting purposes under
the Purchaser Employee Plans as applicable.  
      
    (h)  |   | The Vendor Parties shall notify the Transferred Employees
that all Claims for expenses which qualify for coverage under the terms of
any Employee Plan and which were incurred on or prior to the Closing Date
must be submitted within the time limit provided by the Employee Plans and
no later than 30 days after the Closing Date.

    (j)  |   | _[ Omitted]_  
      
    (k)  |   | For those Employee Plans of a Corporation in which
Employees of the Corporation participated immediately prior to Closing, but
which also covered individuals employed by entities other than the
Corporation or its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Umbrella Plans"), the
provisions of Subsections 8.9(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (i) shall apply, except
that where Asset Vendors or CAE UK Employee Plans are referred to, it shall
be read as "Umbrella Plans", where the Purchaser or its Affiliates is

Plans are referred to it shall be read as "Replacement Umbrella Plans",

    8.10  |   | Vendor and Purchaser Pension Plans  
      
      |   | Vendor Pension Plans.  
      
    (a)  |   | For the purpose of this section, the Vendor Pension Plans
mean the "Retirement Plan for Employees of CAE Inc. and Associated Companies"
and the "Pension Plan for Designated Executive Employees of CAE Inc.
and Associated Companies". In Canada, the Transferred Employees shall
cease to participate in and accrue benefits under the Vendor Pension
Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and subject to regulatory
approval, if required, the assets and liabilities pertaining to the benefits
accrued to the Transferred Employees up to the Closing Date under the
Vendor Pension Plans (the "Transferred Benefits") will be transferred to
the pension plans established or designated by the Purchaser (the
"Purchaser Pension Plans").  
      
      |   | The Purchaser Pension Plans will not necessarily provide
the Transferred Employees, for their service after the Closing Date, with
substantially the same benefits, terms and conditions as those of the Vendor
Pension Plans in effect on the Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees to maintain
the Purchaser Pension Plans for all Transferred Employees for a
minimum period of eighteen (18) months and to fulfill any legal requirements
with respect to these pension plans in Canada during that same minimum
period.  
      
    (b)  |   | Except as otherwise required by the applicable Laws, the
Asset Vendors shall not make, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, any modification to or in respect of the Vendor Pension Plans
prior to the Transfer Date if such modification would affect the Adjusted
Transfer Amount of Assets or the benefits of the Transferred Employees.  
      
    (c)  |   | Subject to and conditional upon the completion of the
asset transfer contemplated in Section 8.10(d) and the payment contemplated
in Section 8.10(l) (if applicable), the Purchaser and the relevant Purchaser
Pension Plans shall assume responsibility for the Transferred Benefits,
including the payment of any solvency deficiency or unfunded liability
disclosed in actuarial valuations for the Purchaser Pension Plans.  
      
    (d)  |   | Subject to and conditional upon obtaining all necessary
regulatory approvals, the Vendor shall transfer or cause to be transferred in
cash an amount equal to the Adjusted Transfer  
     ##### 

  

   

       |   | Amount of Assets and the Adjustment Amount (if the
Transferred Liabilities are greater than the Regulatory Amount of Assets)
from the pension funds of the relevant Vendor Pension Plans to the pension
funds of the relevant Purchaser Pension Plans as further described in
Section 8.10(l).  
---|---|--- 
      
    (e)  |   | The "Adjusted Transfer Amount of Assets" shall be equal
to the Regulatory Amount of Assets adjusted to reflect: (i) the Expenses of
the applicable Vendor Pension Plan in respect of the Transferred Employees;
(ii) the Rate of Return; (iii) any data corrections agreed between the
parties, and (iv) benefit payments to or in respect of Transferred Employees,
all between the Closing Date and the Transfer Date (the "Transitional
Period"), subject to any necessary regulatory approval. The Purchaser shall
be responsible for any contributions to be remitted to the Purchaser
Pension Plans either by the Purchaser as employer or as contributions
deducted from the Transferred Employees payroll after the Closing Date.  
      
    (f)  |   | The "Expenses" shall include any reasonable out of pocket
expenses related to the administration of pension plans, including
without limitation, custodian fees, consulting fees, and fees related to
the general administration of a pension plan such as computation of
benefit entitlements upon termination of employment, death or
retirement, including investment management fees but excluding any fees
incurred in connection with the division of the Vendor Pension Plans and
the determination of the Adjusted Transfer Amount of Assets. Expenses that
can be allocated to specific Transferred Employees shall be so allocated.
All other Expenses shall be allocated pro rata based on the ratio of
the Transferred Liabilities to the total liabilities of the Vendor
Pension Plan (calculated on the same basis). For greater certainty, Expenses
shall not include any internal costs incurred by the Vendor and its
Affiliates but shall include only amounts paid to third parties.  
      
    (g)  |   | The "Regulatory Amount of Assets" shall be the amount of
assets to be transferred out of each Vendor Pension Plan equal to the
Transferred Liabilities, as calculated by the Vendors actuary and subject to
any modification required by the relevant regulatory authorities in respect
of the Transferred Benefits as of the Closing Date, after a joint
undertaking by the Vendor and the Purchaser to obtain the regulators
consent.  
       
    (h)  |   | _[ Omitted]_  
      
      |   | Except as otherwise required by the relevant regulatory
authorities, the Transferred Liabilities will be determined as at the Closing
Date, using the same actuarial assumptions and methods as those used in the
last actuarial valuations of the relevant Vendor Pension Plan filed with
the regulatory authorities (or, if not required to be filed, as set forth
in the Disclosure Letter) except for the solvency valuation
assumptions which shall be that applicable in the month in which the Closing
Date occurs.  
      
    (i)  |   | During the Transitional Period, except as otherwise
required by the relevant regulatory authorities, the Regulatory Amount of
Assets (and the Adjustment Amount as applicable) shall be adjusted for the
period ending on the Transfer Date at the rate of return of the Vendor
Pension Plans (the "Rate of return").  
     ##### 

  

   

     (j)  |   | As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in
any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Vendor shall
initiate the procedure leading to the division of the Vendor Pension Plans in
order to allow for the transfer referred to in Section 8.10(d).  
---|---|--- 
      
      |   | The Vendor shall be responsible for the division of the
Vendor Pension Plans in accordance with applicable Laws, including the
preparation of the relevant actuarial reports. These reports shall be
completed within a period of three (3) months following the Closing Date and
shall be submitted to the Purchaser for its review and confirmation. The
Vendor shall also furnish to the Purchaser, but only with respect to
the Canadian Transferred Employees, such data, calculations and
other information as may reasonably be required or requested to permit
a review, recalculation and confirmation of the relevant actuarial
reports and a review of all amounts contemplated to be calculated under
this Section 8.10(j). The Purchaser shall within thirty (30) days
of receiving such reports, calculations, information and data (or such
later date as the Parties may agree to) notify the Vendor as to its
agreement or disagreement with the Vendors calculations. Upon agreement from
the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Vendor
shall file these reports with the relevant regulatory authorities and take
all reasonable steps to obtain regulatory approvals (including, for
greater certainty, approval for the payment of the Adjustment Amount by
the Vendor to the Vendor Pension Plans and payment of the Adjustment
Amount from the Vendor Pension Plans) on an expeditious basis.  
      
    (k)  |   | During the Transitional Period, the Vendor shall
administer both the benefits of the Transferred Employees under the Vendor
Pension Plans and the investment of the estimated Adjusted Transfer Amount of
Assets and the Adjustment Amount as part of the Vendor Pension Plans and in
accordance with the Vendors standard investment policies in effect from time
to time.  
      
    (l)  |   | The Vendor shall arrange for the pension funds of the
relevant Vendor Pension Plans to transfer an amount of cash equal to the
Adjusted Transfer Amount of Assets (and, subject to the remainder of this
Subsection 8.10(l) the Adjustment Amount, if the Transferred Liabilities are
greater than the Regulatory Amount of Assets) to the pension fund(s) of the
relevant Purchaser Pension Plans on the last day of the calendar month that
is within sixty (60) days after the Vendor receives the final approval of
the regulatory authorities for the transfer for each applicable plan
(such date(s) of transfer, the "Transfer Date"). If the applicable
regulatory authority does not permit the Vendor, after a joint undertaking by
the Vendor and the Purchaser to obtain the regulators consent, to
cause payment of the Adjustment Amount from the applicable Vendor Pension
Plan, on each Transfer Date on which occurs a transfer of assets equal to
the Adjusted Transfer Amount of Assets in respect of the Vendor Pension
Plan, the Vendor shall pay to the Purchaser the Adjustment Amount, if
the Transferred Liabilities are greater than the Regulatory Amount of
Assets. If the Transferred Liabilities are less than the Regulatory Amount
of Assets, the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor the Adjustment Amount on
the applicable Transfer Date. If the Adjustment Amount is paid otherwise
from the Vendor Pension Plans, the Vendor and the Purchaser shall treat
such payment as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.  
     ##### 

  

   

     (m)  |   | The "Adjustment Amount" shall be the amount with
respect to each Vendor Pension Plan, equal to the difference between the
Regulatory Amount of Assets and the corresponding Transferred Liabilities, in
each case which shall be calculated as of the Closing Date and adjusted to
reflect the Rate of return as set out in Section 8.10(i), the Expenses and
the payment of benefits.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (n)  |   | Notwithstanding Section 8.9(d), upon the completion of
the transfer contemplated in Section 8.10(l), the Vendor and the Vendor
Pension Plans shall be completely discharged of all of their respective
obligations with respect to the Transferred Benefits arising from events
occurring after the Closing.  
      
    (o)  |   | All calculations and actuarial reports required by this
Section 8.10 shall be performed or prepared by the Vendors actuary and shall
be subject to review and agreement of the Purchasers actuary, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Purchasers actuary does not
approve the Vendors actuarys calculations or reports, the final
determination shall be made by an independent third-party actuary, who is a
fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, acceptable to both the Vendor
and the Purchaser. If the parties cannot agree on an independent third
party actuary, they shall jointly request that the President of the
Canadian Institute of Actuaries appoint one. The reasonable fees and expenses
of such independent third party actuary shall be borne equally by the
Vendor and the Purchaser.  
      
    8.11  |   | COBRA  
     

 Purchaser shall be solely responsible on and after the Closing Date for claims relating to the continuation health care coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "U.S. Tax Code") and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("COBRA") with respect to U.S. Transferred Employees and their qualified COBRA beneficiaries.   

     8.12  |   | WARN and TUPE  
---|---|--- 
     

 Purchaser shall be responsible for any obligations with respect to the U.S. Transferred Employees under the U.S. Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1998, as well as with the U.K. TUPE Transfer of Undertakings and Protection of Employment, as amended and any applicable state or local equivalent (collectively "WARN") arising or accruing on or after the Closing Date in connection with any actions of Purchaser.   

     8.13  |   | Flexible Spending Accounts  
---|---|--- 
     

 Subject to the requirements of section 125 of the U.S. Tax Code, any unused amounts credited to U.S. Transferred Employees accounts (after the satisfaction of claims for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date) under CAE USAs medical expense reimbursement or dependent care reimbursement plan and any pre-existing elections of the U.S. Transferred Employees in effect thereunder will be transferred to, and assumed by, the applicable Replacement Plan for the balance of the calendar year during which the Closing occurs.    ##### 

  

  

     8.14  |   | CAE UK Pension Plan  
---|---|--- 
     

 The amounts credited to the Transferred Employees of CAE UK under the CAE UK pension scheme shall be dealt with according to the terms of the scheme and any applicable Law after the Termination Date.   

     8.15  |   | CAE USA Terminated Employees  
---|---|--- 
     

 Transferred Employees of CAE USA shall be treated as terminated employees for the purposes of the "Savings, Investment and Employee Benefit Plan Number 1, CAE USA Inc. and Affiliate Companies Section 401(k)".

shall not file or cause to be filed any Tax Return for a post-Closing period
on behalf of any Corporation. The Share Vendor shall prepare (or cause to
be prepared), consistent with past practice to the extent permitted by
law, each Tax Return with respect to the Corporations (other than the
UK Companies) and Share Vendor (or any affiliated group of which
the Corporations or Share Vendor has at any time been a member) required to
be filed for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (b)  |   | Post-Closing Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare or
cause to be prepared each Tax Return with respect to the Corporations
required to be filed after the Closing for Taxable Periods ending after the
Closing. The procedures contemplated by this Section 10.6(b) shall apply with
respect to the two (2) Taxable Periods of any Corporation ending on or after
the Closing Date. In this Section 10.6(b) "Taxable Period" means the
taxation year-end of a Corporation or other relevant fiscal period for
purposes of the applicable Law. Except as provided in this Section 10.6(b),
if any of the Corporations proposes to take a position in a Tax Return for
any of the first two (2) Taxable Periods ending on or after the Closing Date
with respect to any item on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with
the position taken by the Corporation concerned with respect to such item
on its Tax Return for the last Taxable Period ending prior to the
Closing Date (hereinafter referred to as an  
     ##### 

  

   

       |   | "Inconsistent Filing Position"), Purchaser shall not have
the right to be indemnified by the Vendor for any Taxes resulting directly
from a post-Closing Date assessment or reassessment of a Taxable Period
ending prior to the Closing Date with respect to the particular item which
is the subject of the Inconsistent Filing Position, but only to the
extent of the Inconsistent Filing Position actually taken. In the event
a Corporation intends to take an Inconsistent Filing Position,
the Corporation or the Purchaser shall notify the Vendor in writing at
least 30 days prior to the due date for filing of the relevant Tax Return
of its intention to take an Inconsistent Filing Position. The Corporation
or the Purchaser will specify in the notice each item in respect of which
a Corporation intends to take an Inconsistent Filing Position and
will support each such position with a written opinion of tax counsel to
the effect either (i) that the Corporation is required by Law to file the
Tax Return based on the Inconsistent Tax Position, or (ii) that
the Inconsistent Filing Position the Corporation intends to adopt is a
more reasonable position under the applicable Law.  
---|---|--- 
     

 In the event the opinion of tax counsel for the Corporation is that the Corporation is required by Law to adopt a particular Inconsistent Filing Position, the Corporation shall be entitled to file the relevant Tax Return based on the Inconsistent Filing Position and the obligation and liability of the Vendor to indemnify the Purchaser or the Corporation for any Taxes assessed or reassessed upon the Corporation in respect of the particular item shall not be affected.   

 In the event the opinion of tax counsel is that the Inconsistent Filing Position the Corporation intends to adopt is a more reasonable filing position under the applicable Law than the position taken by the Corporation concerned in its Tax Return for the last Taxable Period ending prior to the Closing Date, then:   

     (i)  |   | if Vendor does not consent in writing to such
Inconsistent Filing Position at least 10 days prior to the due date for
filing of the relevant Tax Return and the Corporation files on the basis
of the Inconsistent Filing Position, Vendor shall be released from
its obligation and liability to indemnify Purchaser for any Taxes resulting
directly from a post-Closing Date assessment or reassessment of a Taxable
Period ending prior to the Closing Date with respect to the particular item
which is the subject of the Inconsistent Filing Position but only to the
extent of the  Inconsistent Filing Position actually taken;  
---|---|--- 
      
    (ii)  |   | if Vendor does not consent in writing to such
Inconsistent Filing Position at least ten (10) days prior to the due date
for filing of the relevant Tax Return and the Corporation files the relevant
Tax Return based on the consistent position established by the Corporation in
respect of the item concerned for the last Taxable Period of the Corporation
ending prior to the Closing Date then, in addition to any obligation and
liability of the Vendor to otherwise indemnify the Purchaser or any
Corporation for Taxes under this Agreement, the Vendor shall, in respect of
the Taxable Period in which the Corporation files the Tax Return based on
that consistent position (and, for greater certainty, provided that
the Taxable Period concerned is a Taxable Period ending on or prior to the
second Taxable Period ending after the Closing Date), have the obligation and
liability to  
     ##### 

  

   

       |   | indemnify the Purchaser for the amount by which (A) the
Taxes (exclusive of interest) assessed or reassessed upon the Corporation in
respect of the particular item, exceeds (B) the amount of Taxes that would
otherwise have been payable by the Corporation had the relevant Tax Return
been filed based on the Inconsistent Filing Position;  
---|---|--- 
      
    (iii)  |   | if Vendor consents in writing to such Inconsistent
Filing Position at least 10 days prior to the due date for filing of
the relevant Tax Return, the Vendor shall have no obligation or liability to
indemnify the Purchaser or the Corporation for any Taxes assessed or
reassessed upon the Corporation in respect of the particular item for the
Taxable Period concerned.  
     

 If the Vendor fails to notify the Purchaser or the Corporation in writing within 10 days prior to the due date for filing of the relevant Tax Return as to whether it consents to the Inconsistent Filing Position, the Vendor shall be deemed to have consented to the Inconsistent Filing Position.   

     (c)  |   | Tax Documentation, Audits and Assessments. Vendor shall
prepare, present for review, execute and deliver to Purchaser, in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, all documents, statements
and certificates related to Taxes as may be required by any
Governmental Entity in connection with a Corporation (other than in relation
to the UK Companies) in respect of a period ending on or prior to Closing.
The Purchaser and Vendor shall promptly notify each other in writing of
any notice of any Tax audit of or assessment or reassessment against
any Corporation for any pre-Closing period.

be required by any Governmental Entity in connection with a Corporation or
the Business.

     (b)  |   | Vendor and Purchaser will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the
other (and the Purchaser shall cause a Corporation to provide such
cooperation and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or
claim for refund, determining any liability for Taxes or a right to a refund
of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding
in respect of Taxes related to a Corporation, the Purchased Assets or
the Business. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules and related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. Vendor and Purchaser
will make themselves (and their respective employees) available, on a
mutually convenient basis, to provide explanations of any document or
information provided under this Section 10.7(b). Each of Vendor and Purchaser
will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and all material
records or other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters relevant
to a Corporation, the Purchased Assets or the Business for the

     ##### 

  

   

       |   | taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and
for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) six years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such
time, before Vendor or Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other Party shall be
given the opportunity, after ninety (90) days prior written notice, to
remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other Party may
select (at such other Partys expense). Any information obtained under this
Section 10.7(b) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund
or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 For a period of 10 years after the Closing, the Vendor shall not, and shall ensure that its Affiliates, employees, directors, agents, representatives and consultants do not, disclose to any Person, or use for any purpose, any information exclusively related to the Business, including all information contained in the Transferred Books and Records and all Transferred IP, except as expressly permitted in the Technology Agreement or as necessary for the Vendor or its Affiliates to perform their obligations under the Transitional Services Agreement or the Subcontract Agreement and except as required by Law. The obligations imposed upon the Vendor in this Section 10.8 shall not apply in respect of information relating to the Business (i) if such information is or becomes publicly known other than through an unauthorized act of the Vendor or its Affiliates, Employees, directors, agents, representatives and consultants, (ii) if Purchaser consents in writing to the proposed use or disclosure of such information, (iii) if such information is disclosed to Vendor or any of its Affiliates, director or employees by a third party having no obligation of confidentiality as to such information, or (iv) if such information is independently generated without the use of any such information.

     (a)  |   | _[ Omitted]_  
---|---|--- 
      
    (b)  |   | _[ Omitted]_  
      
    (c)  |   | _[ Omitted]_  
      
    (d)  |   | where Purchaser is at any time entitled to recover from

    11.5  |   | Notification  
     

 Promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof, the Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify in writing the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") of any cause which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to indemnification under this Article 11\. The omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any duty to indemnify and hold harmless which might otherwise exist with respect to such cause only to the extent that the omission to notify prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to exercise its right to defend provided in this Article 11.   

     11.6  |   | Defense of Third Party Claims  
---|---|--- 
      
    (a)  |   | If any legal proceeding shall be instituted or any Claim
shall be asserted by a third party (each a "Third Party Claim") against a
Party and the Party seeks indemnification under Section 11.1 or 11.2 in
respect thereof (in this Section 11.6, the "Indemnified Party"), then the
other Party (in this Section 11.6, the "Indemnifying Party") shall have
the right, after being notified of a Third Party Claim under Section 11.5
and upon giving notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
Business Days of such notification, to defend the Third Party Claim at its
own cost and expense with counsel of its own selection, provided that:  
     

     (i)  |   | the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing that the full
amount of Damages that may be awarded or incurred under such Third
Party Claim shall be subject to indemnification under this Article 11;  
---|---|--- 
     ##### 

  

   

     (ii)  |   | the Indemnified Party shall at all times have the
right to fully participate in the defense at its own expense;  
---|---|--- 
      
    (iii)  |   | the Third Party Claim seeks only monetary damages and
does not seek any injunctive or other relief against the Indemnified Party;
and  
      
    (iv)  |   | legal counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party
is satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably.  
     

     (b)  |   | If the Indemnifying Party fails within thirty (30)
Business Days from receipt of the notice of a Third Party Claim to give
notice of its intention to defend the Third Party Claim in accordance with
this Section 11.6, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have waived
its right to defend the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to undertake or to cause Vendor
to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim and compromise and
settle the Third Party Claim on behalf, for the account and at the risk
and expense of the Indemnifying Party.  
---|---|--- 
      
    (c)  |   | Where the defense of a Third Party Claim is being
undertaken and controlled by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
will use its reasonable efforts to make available to the Indemnifying Party
those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to
assist the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and defending any such
Claims provided the Indemnifying Party reimburses the Indemnified Party
for reasonable and documented expenses associated with any employees
made available by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this Section 11.6(c), which expenses shall not exceed the actual cost
to the Indemnified Party associated with the employees.  
      
    (d)  |   | With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party or its representatives
on a timely basis all documents, records and other materials in the
possession of the Indemnified Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for its use in defending
any such Claim and shall otherwise cooperate on a timely basis with the
Indemnifying Party in the defence of such Claim.  
      
    11.7  |   | Exclusive Remedy  
     

 Purchaser and the Vendor acknowledge and agree that (i) following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser and Vendor for any breach by the other Party of the representations and warranties in this Agreement and for any failure by the other Party to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, except that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms or are otherwise breached, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms thereof or other injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity, and (ii) anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of Purchaser or Vendor, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Transferred Interests contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the    ##### 

  

 

transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages.    

     11.8  |   | Tax Treatment  
---|---|--- 
     

 To the extent permitted by Law, the Parties hereto agree to treat all payments made under this Article 11 or under any other indemnity provision contained in this Agreement or otherwise in connection herewith as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. The Parties further agree that such payments shall be made by the CAE Vendors having disposed of the Assets or Shares of a Corporation in connection to which a Claim is made against or a Loss suffered and that such payment shall be made to the Purchaser or its relevant Affiliates having purchased such Assets or Shares.   

     11.9  |   | GST/QST/HST  
---|---|--- 
     

 If Vendor and Purchaser or the relevant Affiliates for purposes of Section 11.8 acting reasonably determine that any indemnification payment (the "Payment") made hereunder is subject to GST or QST or is deemed by the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) to be inclusive of the GST or the _Act Respecting the Qu ebec Sales Tax _to be inclusive of the QST (or if any other similar Tax is applicable to such Payment), the amount of the Payment shall be increased by the amount of all such Taxes.

     12.6  |   | Reasonableness

     13.8  |   | Non-Merger  
---|---|--- 
     

 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants, representations and warranties shall not merge on and shall survive the Closing and, notwithstanding such Closing and any investigation made by or on behalf of any Party, shall continue in full force and effect. Closing shall not prejudice any right of one Party against any other Party in respect of anything done or omitted under this Agreement or in respect of any right to damages or other remedies.   

     13.9  |   | Entire Agreement  
---|---|--- 
     

 This Agreement together with the agreements referred to herein and the Disclosure Letter constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties. There are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement except as specifically set forth herein and therein and neither Vendor nor Purchaser has relied or is relying on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into and completing the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges that it and its representatives have been permitted access to the books and records, facilities, equipment, Tax returns, contracts, insurance summaries and other property and assets of the Business that Vendor has made available to Purchaser, and Purchaser has not been refused access to any document, asset or facilities relating exclusively to the Business that it has requested to see or review. For greater certainty, except as set forth in Article 3, none of Vendor, its subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives make or have made any other representation or warranty, express or implied, at Law or in equity, in respect of the Business or any of the Transferred Interests, including with respect to (i) merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, (ii) the operation of the Business by Purchaser after Closing in any manner other than as used and operated by Vendor Parties and the Corporations and their Subsidiaries, or (iii) the probable success or profitability of the Business after Closing. Other than the indemnification obligations of Vendor set forth in Article 11, none of Vendor, its subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Purchaser or to any other person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser, its Affiliates or representatives of, or Purchasers use of, any information relating to the Business, including the    ##### 

  

 

confidential offering memorandum in respect of the Business and
any information, documents or material made available to Purchaser, whether
orally or in writing, in certain "data rooms", management presentations,
functional break-out discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf
of Purchaser or in any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such other representation or warranty is
hereby expressly disclaimed.    

     13.10  |   | Successors and Assigns  
---|---|--- 
     

 This Agreement shall become effective when executed by Vendor and Purchaser and after that time shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of Vendor, Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   

     13.11  |   | Assignment  
---|---|--- 
     

 Purchaser shall not, as a result of this Agreement, have the right to assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted to Purchaser under this Agreement, other than in connection with a Permitted Sale (as defined below) or with the prior written consent of Vendor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In determining the reasonableness of any refusal of Vendor to consent to any proposed assignment or transfer, the following factors shall, without limitation, be considered: (i) the extent to which the proposed assignee is a direct competitor of Vendor; (ii) the extent to which the rights purported to be transferred or assigned could be used by the proposed assignee to adversely affect the competitive position of Vendor; (iii) the absence of reasonable contractual safeguards to ensure that restrictive covenants and confidentiality provisions of this Agreement will be complied with by the purported assignee and/or transferee, and (iv) the lack of access by Vendor to reasonable enforcement rights and remedies for breach of any such restrictive covenants or confidentiality provisions. The Parties agree that a Permitted Sale shall not require any Vendor consent hereunder. For the purpose of this provision, a "Permitted Sale" means any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, a merger or a reorganization of Purchaser, a change of control of Purchaser and any assignment or transfer to a Permitted Affiliate; provided that any such assignment shall not relieve either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of their obligations hereunder and they shall remain jointly and severally liable.   

     13.12  |   | Inconsistency  
---|---|--- 
     

 This Agreement shall override the Exhibits annexed hereto to the extent of any inconsistency.   

     13.13  |   | Severability  
---|---|--- 
     

 If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined by an arbitrator or any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.   

     13.14  |   | Governing Law  
---|---|--- 
     

 This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal Laws of Canada applicable therein.    ##### 

  

  

     13.15  |   | Counterparts  
---|---|--- 
     

 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including counterparts by facsimile) and all such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement on the date
first above mentioned.
