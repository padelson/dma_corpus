interest and any reasonable legal and accounting fees) reasonably incurred in connection with: (1)
the aforesaid Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election, and (2)&nbsp;the receipt not later than April&nbsp;11, 2008 by
such Seller from the Purchaser of the Tax Indemnification Payment. If the Purchaser makes a Tax
Indemnification Payment to a Seller (or, as provided by the following paragraph), to the Tax Escrow

is consistent with the Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position contrary thereto or
inconsistent therewith in any Tax return or in any discussion with or proceeding before any taxing

Purchaser shall notify the Sellers in writing of such decision so that each Seller has sufficient
time to calculate the Tax Indemnification Payment to be made by the Purchaser to such Seller but in

the 338(h)(10) Election, but in any event not later than the date specified in the Tax Timetable

fully any additional Tax (whether denominated as income, excise, sales or use, transfer, Built-In
Gains (net of any deduction available to the Sellers which is attributable to the Company&#146;s payment
of such Built-in-Gains Tax), penalty and interest or other Tax and regardless of whether such
additional Tax, penalty or interest is imposed by any Federal, state or local governmental
authority) incurred by such Seller as a result of the Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election having been made,
but also any additional Tax (whether denominated as income, excise, sales or use, transfer,

Company&#146;s payment of such Built-in-Gains Tax), penalty or interest or other Tax and regardless of
whether such additional Tax is imposed by any Federal, state or local governmental authority)
attributable to the receipt by each such Seller of the Tax Indemnification Payment. The Tax
Indemnification Payment for a Seller shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such Seller (or, if applicable, to the Tax Escrow Agent) at the Account specified in the Wiring
Instructions, no later than April&nbsp;11, 2008. By way of further clarification, it is the intention
of all the parties that the Tax Indemnification Payment that will be paid by the Purchaser to each
of the Sellers will be an amount sufficient so that each Seller will receive the same after-tax
proceeds from the sale of its Shares, after payment of all such additional Taxes (including
penalties, interest, and reasonable legal and accounting fees), that it would have received had the
Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election not been made. If any subsequent adjustment made by any taxing
authority to the Taxes payable as a result of the Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election increases the Taxes
payable by the Sellers as a result of the 338(h)(10) Election, other than any adjustment to the
amount of the aggregate payments by the Company under the Phantom Stock Plans which is deductible,
the Purchaser shall pay an amount to the Sellers to compensate for such increase within 30&nbsp;days of
written demand by the Sellers Representative. If any such adjustment causes a decrease in the
Taxes payable by the Sellers as a result of the Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election, then the Sellers shall
reimburse the Purchaser for such amount within 30&nbsp;days following Purchaser&#146;s delivery of written
notice of such determination to the Sellers&#146; Representative.

Code) shall be allocated among the Company&#146;s and Subsidiary&#146;s assets in accordance with the
principles of Section&nbsp;338 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The Purchaser shall prepare,
using its goods faith efforts, and deliver to the Sellers a proposed allocation of such
consideration in accordance with the Tax Timetable. Unless, within 10&nbsp;days from receipt thereof,
the Sellers disagree in writing with such allocation, the amount so allocated to each asset shall
