Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be effective as of 8:00 a.m. (Manhattan, Kansas time) on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time") provided, however, that all payments by the Company under the Phantom Stock Plans, as well as the distributions and success bonuses contemplated by _Section 4.9_ and the expenses paid under this _Section 2_ by the Company, shall be deemed to be effective immediately prior to such Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.2 _Amount of Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares shall be an amount equal to $116,600,000 (the "Purchase Price"), as adjusted prior to and after the Closing Date pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.3_. 

  

 2.3 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. 

   

 2.3.1 Prior to the date hereof, the Company delivered to the Purchaser an estimate, prepared by the Company in good faith (based upon (i) information then available to the Company, (ii) the Agreed Principles and (iii) such assumptions as a reasonably prudent business person would make in preparing such an estimate), of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). The Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date under _Section 2.2_ shall be (1) increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the total of: (i) the Target Net Working Capital and (ii) $500,000; and (2) decreased, on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the total of: (i) the Target Net Working Capital less (ii) $500,000 exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital. 

   

 2.3.2 As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers Representative a closing statement (the "Closing Statement") fairly presenting the Net Working Capital as determined, as of the Effective Time, in accordance with the Agreed Principles (the "Closing Net Working Capital"), together with a certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth the Purchasers calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital. The preparation of the Closing Statement and such certificate shall be for the sole purpose of determining the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital and the Target Net Working Capital. 

   

 2.3.3 If the Sellers Representative disagrees with the Purchasers calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.2_, then the Sellers Representative may, within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to the Purchaser (with a copy to each of the Indemnifying Sellers) disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth the Sellers Representatives calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which the Sellers Representative disagrees, and the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have agreed, on behalf of the Indemnifying Sellers, with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to  _Section 2.3.2_. 

   

 2.3.4 If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.3_ , the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall, during the 30 days following such delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Net Working Capital, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in the Sellers Representatives calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.3_ nor less than the amount thereof shown in the Purchasers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.2_. If during such period, the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause KPMG Peat Marwick (the "Independent Accountant") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Closing Net Working Capital (it being understood that, in making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and the Purchasers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital as to which the Sellers Representatives has disagreed. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative and the Indemnifying 

   ##### 

  

   

Sellers, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than 30
days from the date of engagement of the Independent Accountant), a report
setting forth such calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. Such report
shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Indemnifying Sellers.
The cost of such review and report shall be paid equally by the Purchaser and
the Sellers. 

   

 2.3.5 The Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and in the conduct of the review referred to in this _Section 2.3_, including, without limitation, promptly making available to both the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative any relevant books, records, work papers and personnel. 

   

 2.3.6 If the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the total of (I) the Target Net Working Capital and (II) $500,000, then the Purchaser shall pay to each Indemnifying Seller, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 2.3.7_, such Indemnifying Sellers Pro Rata portion of the amount of such excess and, if the total of (A) the Target Net Working Capital less (B) $500,000 exceeds the Final Net Working Capital, then the Indemnifying Sellers shall, severally and not jointly, pay to the Purchaser, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 2.3.7_, such Indemnifying Sellers Pro Rata portion of the amount of such excess. "Final Net Working Capital" means the Closing Net Working Capital (1) as shown in the Purchasers calculation delivered pursuant to  _Section 2.3.2_ if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.3_; or (2) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (i) as agreed by the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section 2.3.4_ or (ii) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Independent Accountants calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Final Net Working Capital be less than the Purchasers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3.2_ or more than the Sellers Representatives calculation thereof delivered pursuant to  _Section 2.3.3_. 

   

 2.3.7 Any payment pursuant to _Section 2.3.6_ shall be: (1) deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price, (2) made not later than five Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital has been determined, and (3) made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such recipient thereof under _Section 2.3.6_ as such recipient may designate in writing by such other party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest announced by the Harris Bank as its Prime Rate in Chicago, Illinois in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

Each of the Purchaser, the Company (if necessary) and the Indemnifying Sellers shall: (1) make or cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their respective Affiliates under the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event, not later than 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement in the case of all filings required under the HSR Act and within four weeks in the case of all other filings (if any) required by other such antitrust Laws; (2) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other such antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials received by each of them or any of their respective subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Body in respect of such filings or such transactions; and (3) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith).

   ##### 

  

  

 6.6 _Discharge of Liens_. On or before the Closing Date, the Sellers will take such action as may be necessary to discharge any Lien (other than Permitted Exceptions) on the assets and properties of the Company and the Subsidiary. 

  

 6.7 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Subject to compliance by the Purchaser with the Tax Timetable, with respect to the acquisition of the Shares hereunder, the Purchaser reserves the right to make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code at any time on or prior to the due date for making any such election as provided for by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder; provided, however, that the Sellers shall have no obligation to cooperate with the Purchaser with respect to such an election if (1) the Purchaser has not complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Tax Timetable required to be performed by the Purchaser or (2) the Sellers have not received the Tax Indemnification Payment by April 11, 2008. If the Purchaser makes such election and the Purchaser makes the Tax Indemnification Payment (as defined below) to each of the Sellers, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall jointly make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local tax law) (collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). The term "Tax Indemnification Payment" shall mean, for each Seller, the amount that the Purchaser shall be required to pay to such Seller equal to the aggregate amount reasonably required to reimburse such Seller on a net, after-tax basis for any cost, loss, liability or expense (including any increase in liability for Taxes, penalties, and interest and any reasonable legal and accounting fees) reasonably incurred in connection with: (1) the aforesaid Section 338(h)(10) Election, and (2) the receipt not later than April 11, 2008 by such Seller from the Purchaser of the Tax Indemnification Payment. If the Purchaser makes a Tax Indemnification Payment to a Seller (or, as provided by the following paragraph), to the Tax Escrow Agent on or prior to April 11, 2008, such Seller will take, and will cooperate with the Purchaser and with each other Seller to take, all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a timely Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the Code and the regulations thereunder, or any successor provisions. If the Purchaser has elected to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and makes the Tax Indemnification Payment to each of the Sellers, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, for Tax purposes, report the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in a manner which is consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith in any Tax return or in any discussion with or proceeding before any taxing authority, or otherwise. Promptly after deciding to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers in writing of such decision so that each Seller has sufficient time to calculate the Tax Indemnification Payment to be made by the Purchaser to such Seller but in no event later than the date specified in the Tax Timetable. As soon as practicable following the receipt by such Seller of the irrevocable written notice from the Purchaser of its decision to make the 338(h)(10) Election, but in any event not later than the date specified in the Tax Timetable for the same, each Seller shall deliver a written statement containing the amount of the Tax Indemnification Payment which is claimed to be due to such Seller and the manner in which the amount of such Tax Indemnification Payment has been calculated to the Purchaser. 

  

 If the Purchaser disagrees with a Sellers calculation of the Tax Indemnification Payment, then the Purchaser shall pay (1) to such Seller the amount of the Tax Indemnification Payment as calculated by the Purchaser for such Seller (the "Purchasers Amount") and (2) to the Tax Escrow Agent an amount equal to (i) the amount of the Tax Indemnification Payment which the Purchaser disagrees with (and as calculated by such Seller) less (ii) the Purchasers Amount. The Tax Escrow Agent shall agree to hold the Purchasers Amount for the Purchaser and such Seller until the Purchaser and such Seller resolve their differences with respect to the amount of the disputed Tax Indemnification Payment in accordance with the procedures described in _Section 2.3.4_ (with respect to the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital). Upon payment by the Purchaser to the Tax Escrow Agent of the amount of the disputed Tax Indemnification Payment, the Seller that has computed the Tax Indemnification Payment which is in 

   ##### 

  

    

dispute shall take, and cooperate with the Purchaser and each other Seller
to take, all actions necessary and appropriate to effect and preserve a
timely Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

 By way of clarification, if the Purchaser elects to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Tax Indemnification Payment that is to be made by the Purchaser to each such Seller shall be computed individually for each such Seller, in an amount which is not only necessary to offset fully any additional Tax (whether denominated as income, excise, sales or use, transfer, Built-In Gains (net of any deduction available to the Sellers which is attributable to the Companys payment of such Built-in-Gains Tax), penalty and interest or other Tax and regardless of whether such additional Tax, penalty or interest is imposed by any Federal, state or local governmental authority) incurred by such Seller as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election having been made, but also any additional Tax (whether denominated as income, excise, sales or use, transfer, Built-In Gains (net of any deduction available to the Sellers which is attributable to the Companys payment of such Built-in-Gains Tax), penalty or interest or other Tax and regardless of whether such additional Tax is imposed by any Federal, state or local governmental authority) attributable to the receipt by each such Seller of the Tax Indemnification Payment. The Tax Indemnification Payment for a Seller shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such Seller (or, if applicable, to the Tax Escrow Agent) at the Account specified in the Wiring Instructions, no later than April 11, 2008. By way of further clarification, it is the intention of all the parties that the Tax Indemnification Payment that will be paid by the Purchaser to each of the Sellers will be an amount sufficient so that each Seller will receive the same after-tax proceeds from the sale of its Shares, after payment of all such additional Taxes (including penalties, interest, and reasonable legal and accounting fees), that it would have received had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been made. If any subsequent adjustment made by any taxing authority to the Taxes payable as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election increases the Taxes payable by the Sellers as a result of the 338(h)(10) Election, other than any adjustment to the amount of the aggregate payments by the Company under the Phantom Stock Plans which is deductible, the Purchaser shall pay an amount to the Sellers to compensate for such increase within 30 days of written demand by the Sellers Representative. If any such adjustment causes a decrease in the Taxes payable by the Sellers as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, then the Sellers shall reimburse the Purchaser for such amount within 30 days following Purchasers delivery of written notice of such determination to the Sellers Representative. 

  

 If the Purchaser elects to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election, then the consideration paid for the Shares (and any other amounts required to be capitalized pursuant to Section 338 of the Code) shall be allocated among the Companys and Subsidiarys assets in accordance with the principles of Section 338 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The Purchaser shall prepare, using its goods faith efforts, and deliver to the Sellers a proposed allocation of such consideration in accordance with the Tax Timetable. Unless, within 10 days from receipt thereof, the Sellers disagree in writing with such allocation, the amount so allocated to each asset shall be as proposed by the Purchaser and shall constitute the agreed upon allocation. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall utilize the allocation of consideration described in and agreed upon pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ in the preparation of all Tax Returns or forms and for all other Tax purposes, including, but not limited to, the preparation of IRS Form [8883\. Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers shall agree to any adjustment relating to the manner in which the consideration has been allocated as set forth in this _Section 6.7_ without the prior written approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The parties agree to consult and resolve in good faith any disputes in allocating the consideration under this _Section 6.7_. Any adjustment to the Purchase Price paid pursuant to this Agreement shall result in an appropriate adjustment to such allocation. 

  

 For purposes of the Tax Indemnification Payment (including the calculation thereof) under this  _Section 6.7_, the terms "Seller" and "Sellers" shall mean the grantor, the beneficiaries or any other deemed owner of such Seller. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.8 _Tax Benefit Payment_. 

  

 6.8.1 If the Purchaser does not elect to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election as contemplated by _Section 6.7_, then the Purchaser shall, not later than the due date (without extension) for filing its Tax Return for the year ending December 31, 2007, pay to each of the Sellers, a Pro Rata portion of the Tax Benefit that will be available to the Company and/or the Purchaser (or their respective successors or assignees) for the tax period ending December 31, 2007, arising from the aggregate amount paid by the Company or the Purchaser (or their respective successors or assignees) and included in the calculation of the Tax Benefit. 

   

 6.8.2 In addition, if the Purchaser does not elect to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Sellers shall, promptly following the last day for filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Election set forth in the Tax Timetable, take such action as may be necessary to apply to the applicable Governmental Body for a refund of the full amount of the payment, if any, made by the Purchaser as an estimate of the amount of the Built-in-Gains Tax payable by the Company. If and to the extent that the amount of any refund received by the Company is less than the payment made by the Purchaser as an estimate of the Built-in-Gains Tax payable by the Company, the Sellers shall, jointly and severally pay to the Company, within 30 days following delivery by the Purchaser to the Sellers Representative of a written demand for payment, the amount by which the amount paid by the Purchaser as an estimate of the Built-in-Gains Tax payable by the Company exceeds the amount of the refund received by the Company. 

   

 6.8.3 If the Purchaser makes a Section 338(h)(10) Election and the IRS denies a deduction to the Sellers on their final S Corporation Tax Return for all or any part of the payments made to the PSP Holders, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay to the Sellers the Tax Benefit, if any, attributable to the Companys deduction of the portion of the payment made to the PSP Holders that was disallowed by the IRS but only if the IRS approves a full current deduction to the Purchaser, for the first Tax period following the Closing Date, of the portion of the Phantom Stock Plan payment for which the deduction has been disallowed to the Sellers, in addition to a deduction as goodwill of an amount equal to: (1) the portion of the Purchase Price used to make the Phantom Stock Payments; reduced by (2) the portion of the Phantom Stock Plan payment which the IRS has approved as being deductible by the Purchaser. The payment required to be made by the Company to the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 6.8.3_ shall be paid to the Sellers not later than 30 days after the IRS allows the Purchaser or the Company to claim such deduction. 

   

 6.9 _Payment of Withholding Taxes_. On the Closing Date the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and take such action as may be reasonably required to cause the employee portion of all applicable withholding taxes payable in connection with the payments made under the Phantom Stock Plans and the employer portion of all applicable withholding taxes payable in connection with the payments made under the Phantom Stock Plans to be paid, on the Closing Date by check or other payment authorization, from funds paid to the Company by Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 2.4.4_. 

  

 6.10 _Post Closing Severance Payments_. The Sellers shall be responsible for and pay, promptly following the Closing Date, any and all severance payments payable to the individuals identified in _Schedule 6.10_ as required by the Terms of Florence Corporations Non-Solicitation, Non-Competition and Confidentiality Agreement.

 6.13 _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing Date, none of the Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiary, nor the Purchaser shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of the Purchaser or the Sellers, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange, provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its best efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

 6.14 _Environmental Matters_.

 6.15 _Updated Schedules_. All of the _Schedules_ shall be updated by the Company and the Sellers, as provided in this _Section 6.15_, and delivered to the Purchaser at the Closing (collectively, the "Updated Schedules").

supersede any claims or rights of the Purchaser under _Section 9.1.2_. The
provisions of this _Section 9.1.3_ are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Companys and the Subsidiarys current and
former directors and officers. 

  

 9.2 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

   

 9.2.1 Provided that no claim for payment of a Tax Indemnification Payment has been made by a Seller against the Purchaser, the obligation of the Purchaser to pay to each Seller the amount of the Tax Indemnification Payment shall terminate and expire 60 days following the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the assessment and collection of Taxes for the tax year of the Sellers in which the Closing Date occurs. 

   

 9.2.2 The Indemnifying Sellers shall not have any liability under _Section 9.1.1_ nor shall the Purchaser be entitled to indemnification for any Indemnified Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from matters within the actual knowledge of the Purchaser at the Effective Time or accounted for or included in the calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to the procedures of _Section 2.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 9.1.1_, the obligation of the Company to indemnify any party identified in _Section 9.1.1_, shall terminate, expire and cease to exist at the Effective Time. 

   

 9.2.3 Except as otherwise set forth above, an Indemnifying Party shall not have any liability under _Section 9.1.1(1)_ or _Section 9.1.2(1)_ hereof unless: (1) the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses to the indemnified parties ("Collectible Damages"), as finally determined to arise thereunder resulting from the failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct exceeds $15,000 (each breach, non-fulfillment or other indemnified matter described in _Section 9.1.1(1)_ or _Section 9.1.2(1)_ for which the Collectible Damages exceeds such amount being referred to as "Covered Breach"), and (ii) the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses, collectively, resulting from Covered Breaches (including the first $15,000 of each Covered Breach), exceed $1,000,000 (the "Deductible"); it being understood that, if the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses attributable to Covered Breaches exceeds the Deductible, the Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to recover the amount by which the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses attributable to Covered Breaches exceeds the Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of an Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against Indemnified Losses arising from any matter other than the matters described in _Section 9.1.1(1)_ and _Section 9.1.2(1)_ above shall not, except as set forth in the proviso to this sentence, be limited to the extent that such Indemnified Losses are less than $15,000 or less than the amount of the Deductible, it being the intent of this sentence that an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified from and against the full amount of all Indemnified Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party as a result of all matters for which indemnification is provided for by _Section 9.1.1_ and _Section 9.1.2_ hereof other than the matters described in _Section 9.1.1(1)_ and _Section 9.1.2_ (1) above, whether or not such Indemnified Losses exceed the Deductible and whether or not such Indemnified Losses are Covered Breaches provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate obligations of the Indemnifying Sellers with respect to indemnification relating to all matters described in: (I) _Section 9.1.1_ (other than those under  _Section 9.1.1(4)_) exceed $11,800,000; and (II) _Section 9.1.1(4)_ exceed $20,000,000. 

   

 9.2.4 The Indemnifying Sellers acknowledge and agree that the maximum aggregate amount of the Indemnified Losses that the Indemnifying Sellers may be obligated to pay exceeds the portion of the Purchase Price that is to be paid to the Escrow Agent. Accordingly, if the aggregate amount of the Indemnified Losses payable by the Sellers under this _Section 9_ exceeds the amount held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement, each of the Indemnifying 

   ##### 

  

    

Sellers shall be liable for its Pro Rata share of the amount of any
such excess. Each Indemnifying Seller shall pay its share of any such excess
to the Indemnified Party within 15 days following receipt of written notice
from the Sellers Representative of the amount of such Indemnifying Sellers
Pro Rata share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
aggregate liabilities of any Indemnifying Seller under this _Section 9_
exceed an amount equal to such Indemnifying Sellers Pro Rata share of
$11,800,000 with respect to Indemnified Losses suffered by the Purchaser
Affiliates as a result of the matters described in _Section 9.1.1_ (other
than the matters described in _Section 9.1.1(4)_ ) or $20,000,000 with
respect to Indemnified Losses suffered by the Purchaser Affiliates as a
result of the matters described in _Section 9.1.1(4)_. 

   

 9.2.5 Except as provided in _Section 9.2.1_, the obligation of the Purchaser to indemnify the Sellers from and against Indemnified Losses arising from the matters described in _Sections 6.7, 6.8 and 9.1.2(4_) shall not be limited in any way. 

  

 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

   

 9.3.1 In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim or demand (such Legal Proceedings, claim or demand, a "Claim") shall be asserted by any Person in respect of which payment may be sought under _Section 9.1_ hereof, the Person entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall: (1) if the Indemnified Party is any of the Purchaser Affiliates, reasonably and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent; and (2) if the Indemnified Party is any of the Seller Affiliates, reasonably and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Purchaser. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Indemnified Losses hereunder; provided that no settlement of any Claim shall be made by the Indemnifying Party, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Indemnified Losses, it shall within 5 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Indemnified Losses, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such Indemnified Losses under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Claim. 

   

 9.3.2 Upon: (1) final determination of the amount of the Indemnified Losses as a result of any final judgment or award rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom; or (2) the consummation of a settlement of a Claim; or (3) the execution and delivery of a mutually binding agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to a Claim hereunder; then (4) if the Indemnified Party is: (i) the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Affiliates and the amount by which the final amount of the Indemnified Losses exceeds the Deductible is less than or equal to the amount then remaining in the Escrow Account, the Indemnified Party 

   ##### 

  

    

shall forward to the Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent written
notice of the sums due and the Sellers Representative shall take such action
as may be necessary to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser or the
Purchaser Affiliates, all of the sums so due and owing within 5 Business Days
following receipt of such written notice; (ii) the Purchaser or any of the
Purchaser Affiliates and the amount by which the Indemnified Losses exceeds
the Deductible is greater than the amount then remaining in the Escrow
Account, the Indemnified Party shall forward the Sellers Representative and,
if any amount is then remaining in the Escrow Account, forward the Escrow
Agent, written notice of the amount of the sums due to the Indemnified Party
and the Sellers Representative shall take such action as may be necessary to
cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser or the Purchasers Affiliates,
the amount, if any, then remaining in the Escrow Account within 30 days
following receipt of such written notice and shall further deliver written
notice to each of the Sellers and the PR Holder of the amount of
their respective Pro Rata shares of the amount due to the Indemnified Party
after payment to the Indemnified Party of the amount, if any, remaining in
the Escrow Account; and (iii) any of the Sellers, the Sellers Representative
shall forward to the Purchaser written notice of any sums due and owing by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the
Purchaser shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to
the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds within 30 days
after the date of such notice. 

   

 9.3.3 The failure of an Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Claim shall not release and waive the Indemnifying Partys obligations with respect thereto unless the Indemnified Party can demonstrate that there was actual loss and prejudice to the Indemnifying Party as a result of such failure. 

   

 9.3.4 The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive for a period of 365 days beginning on the day immediately following the Closing Date; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.2_, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.6 and 5.2 shall survive indefinitely and shall not expire; (2) the representations and warranties contained in  _Section 4.10_ shall survive for a period of 60 days following the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the assessment and collection of the Taxes covered by such representations and warranties; and (3) the representations and warranties contained in  _Section 4.19_ shall survive for a period of 731 days beginning on the first day following the Closing Date. 

   

 9.3.5 The Purchaser Affiliates shall have no right to be indemnified and the Indemnifying Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Affiliates with respect to any Claim which is based upon the failure of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 4_ hereof or any representation or warranty contained in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Company to be true and correct as of the date made and as of the Closing Date if written notice of the Claim is not delivered to the Sellers Representative prior to the expiration of the period during which the applicable representation or warranty survives the closing as set forth in _Section 9.3.4_ hereof. 

   

 9.3.6 The Seller Affiliates shall have no right to be indemnified and the Purchaser shall have no obligation to indemnify the Seller Affiliates with respect to any Claim which is based upon the failure of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 5_ hereof or any representation or warranty contained in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Purchaser to be true and correct as of the date made and as of the Closing Date if written notice of the Claim is not delivered to the Purchaser prior to the expiration of the period during which the applicable representation or warranty survives the Closing as set forth in _Section 9.3.4_ hereof.

10\. TAX MATTERS 

   

 10.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. 

  

 10.1.1 The parties hereto understand that the Company: (1) is a "S Corporation", within the meaning of Section 1361 of the Code, and (2) will retain that status until the Closing Date (if a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made) or until the day prior to the Closing Date (if no Section 338(h)(10) Election is made). Each of the Sellers shall include on his, her or its income Tax Return, such Sellers Pro Rata share of the taxable income of the Company. The Sellers will cause the Company to file: (i) the United States federal income Tax Returns of the Company for the taxable periods of the Company ending on the Closing date or on the day prior to the Closing Date, as the case may be, and (ii) where applicable, all other Tax Returns of the Company for the taxable periods of the Company ending (or the portion of any taxable period ending) on the Closing Date or prior to the Closing Date or on the day prior to the Closing Date, as the case may be. Except for any Built-in-Gains Tax, which shall be paid by the Purchaser, the Sellers shall cause the Company to pay any and all Taxes due with respect to the returns referred to in _Section 10.1.1(i) and (ii)_. The Sellers also shall cause the Company to file all other Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed (taking into account any extensions) prior to or on the Closing Date and shall cause the Company to pay any and all Taxes (other than any Built-in-Gains Tax) due with respect to such Tax Returns. All Tax Returns described in this _Section 10.1.1_ shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice unless a past practice has been finally determined to be incorrect by the applicable taxing authority or a contrary treatment is required by applicable tax laws (or the judicial or administrative interpretations thereof). The Sellers shall, prior to the filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date, permit the Purchaser to review and comment upon all such Tax Returns. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith mutually to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing thereof. Any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns which are not resolved prior to the filing thereof shall be promptly resolved pursuant to _Section 10.5_ which shall be binding on the parties. 

   

 10.1.2 Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing or causing to be prepared all federal, foreign, state and local Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiary for all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed all such Tax Returns and shall pay the Taxes shown due thereon. 

   

 10.1.3 For federal income tax purposes, the taxable year of the Company shall end on the Closing Date (if a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made) or on the day prior to the Closing Date (if no Section 338(h)(10) Election is made), and, with respect to all other Taxes, the Sellers and the Purchaser will, unless prohibited by applicable law, close the taxable period of the Company as of the Closing Date (if a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made) or as of the day prior to the Closing Date (if no Section 338(h)(10) Election is made). None of the Sellers nor the Purchaser shall take any position inconsistent with the preceding sentence on any Tax Return. 

   

 10.2 _Cooperation with Respect to Tax Returns_. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, and each at their own expense, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and assistance, including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanations of any material provided, relating to the Company as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes. The Purchaser or the Company shall retain in its possession, and shall provide the Sellers reasonable access to (including the right to make copies of ), such supporting books and records and any other materials that the Sellers may specify with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to Tax matters relating to any taxable period ending on the Closing
Date or on the day prior to the Closing Date, as the case may be, until the
relevant statute of limitations has expired. After such time, the Purchaser
may dispose of such material, provided that, prior to such disposition, the
Purchaser shall give the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to take possession
of such materials. 

  

 10.3 _Tax Audits_. 

   

 10.3.1 After the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Company shall have the right to participate in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date that may have the effect of increasing the Purchasers, the Companys or the Subsidiarys Tax liability for any Tax period ending before or after the Closing Date and the Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. In connection with any such proceeding, the Sellers shall bear their own costs and expenses and the Purchaser and the Company shall bear their own costs and expenses. 

   

 10.3.2 If any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes or affects any Tax for which the Sellers are responsible hereunder, the Purchaser shall, promptly upon receipt by the Purchaser or the Company of notice thereof, inform the Sellers thereof. 

   

 10.3.3 After the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative shall have the right to participate in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax period beginning on or after the Closing Date that may have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the Sellers for any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date and the Purchaser and the Company shall not settle or compromise any such proceeding without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative. In connection with any such proceeding, the Purchaser and the Company shall bear their own costs and expenses and the Sellers shall bear their own costs and expenses. 

  

 10.4 _Refund Claims_. To the extent any determination of tax liability of the Company, whether as the result of an audit or examination, a claim for refund, the filing of an amended return or otherwise, results in any refund of Taxes paid (other than Built-in-Gains Taxes under Section 1374 of the Code paid by the Purchaser with respect to the Tax period ending on the Closing Date), any such refund shall belong to the Sellers. To the extent any determination of the liability of the Company for Built-in-Gains Taxes for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date, whether as a result of an audit or examination, a claim for a refund, the filing of an amended return or otherwise, results in a refund of any such Built-in-Gains Taxes, any such refund shall belong to the Purchaser. Any payments made under this _Section 10.4_ shall be net of any Taxes payable with respect to such refund, credit or interest thereon (taking into account any actual reduction in tax liability realized upon the payment pursuant to this _Section 10.4_). 

  

 10.5 _Disputes_. Except as specifically provided in _Section 2.3_: (a) any dispute as to any matter covered hereby shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the Purchaser; and (b) the fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers and the Purchaser. 

  

11\. MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 11.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the Company and the Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall pay for all sales,
use, transfer, intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or
charges, of any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 11.2 _Further Assurances_. The Sellers and the Purchaser each agree to execute and deliver such other documents or agreements and to take such other action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for the implementation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 11.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. 

   

 11.3.1 The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the State of Illinois, County of Cook, with respect to any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action or proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such action or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 

   

 11.3.2 Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.6_. 

  

 11.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto) represents the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law. 

  

 11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to conflicts of laws principles. 

  

 11.6 _Notices_. All notices and other communication under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the parties (and shall also be transmitted by facsimile to the Persons receiving copies thereof) at the

 _Agreed Principles_   

  

Agreed Principles for Calculating 

   

Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital  

  

as of August 31, 2007.  

 

Current assets and current liabilities shall be computed in accordance with
GAAP and shall be derived in a manner consistent with the Companys internal
consolidated financial statements (with a copy of the July, 2007 balance
sheet of the Company included for reference as Attachment 1 hereto). 

  

Current assets shall be adjusted to eliminate the following items, to the
extent they are reflected on the balance sheet: 

    

(a) Shareholder Receivable: Represents a loan to Debbie Cummings 

   

(b) Prepaid Officer Life Insurance: Prepaid expenses relating to the salary
continuation plans for John Alstadt, Frank Vecchione, David Dailey and Mike
Powles 

   

(c) Pre-Paid Consulting Fees: Consulting fees prepaid to Kerry Krafthefer 

 

Current liabilities shall be adjusted to eliminate the following items, to the
extent they are reflected on the balance sheet: 

    

(a) Accrued Bonus: Accrued bonuses for Lloyd Schooley and Mike Powles 

   

(b) Accrued Legal Fees: Accrued expenses to Suzanne Dallmeyer 

   

(c) Accrued Interest: Accrued interest on the IRB. 

 

In addition, current liabilities shall exclude liabilities related to the
transaction contemplated by the Agreement to which this Annex is attached],
to the extent they are reflected on the balance sheet, including phantom
stock payments, transaction related bonuses, related payroll costs such
as FICA, transaction costs, and Section 338 (h) (10) Acquisition Costs that
have not been paid on or before the Closing. 

  

For purposes of illustration only, Attachment 1 hereto presents an example of
the foregoing methodology to be followed for calculating Net Working
Capital. 

  

As used herein, the term "Section 338(h)(10) Acquisition Costs" means all
taxes paid or payable by the Company and the Subsidiary as a result of a
Section 338(h)(10) Election.
