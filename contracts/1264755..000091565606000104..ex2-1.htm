3.1.1 All  shares of Westbank Common Stock held in the treasury of Westbank

and without regard  to  any future vesting date thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right  to  receive a cash payment from Westbank or WB on
the Business Day immediately  prior  to the Effective Date in an amount
determined by multiplying (i) the positive  difference, if any, between the
Cash Election Price and the exercise price  of  such Option for each share
of Westbank Common Stock subject to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  Option (the "Option Price") by (ii) the number of shares of Westbank

Option Consideration, as they deem  appropriate.

certificates or scrip representing  fractional shares of NewAlliance Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender  for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to  NewAlliance Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional  share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner  thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of NewAlliance. In  lieu  of the issuance
of any such fractional share, NewAlliance shall pay to each  former holder of
Westbank Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to  receive a
fractional share of NewAlliance Common Stock, an amount in cash  determined
by multiplying the Cash Election Price by the fraction of a share  of 
NewAlliance Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to 
receive pursuant to Section 3.1.3 hereof (the "Fractional Share
Consideration").  No interest will be paid on the cash that the holders of
such fractional shares  shall be entitled to receive upon such delivery. For
purposes of determining  any  fractional share interest, all shares of
Westbank Common Stock owned by a  Westbank shareholder shall be combined so
as to calculate the maximum number  of  whole shares of NewAlliance Common
Stock issuable to such Westbank  shareholder.

 



 

The  Stock  Election Consideration, the Cash Election Consideration and the
Fractional  Share  Consideration shall be referred to as the "Stock Merger
Consideration," and  the  Stock Merger Consideration and the Option
Consideration are sometimes referred  to collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."

 



 

3.1.6 After  the  Effective Time, shares of Westbank Common Stock shall be
no longer outstanding  and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and shall  thereafter by operation of this Section 3.1.6 be a right to
receive the Merger  Consideration.

 



 

3.1.7 Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if either of the tax  opinions referred to in Section 9.1.5 cannot be
rendered because the counsel  charged with providing either of such opinions
reasonably determines that the  Merger may not satisfy the continuity of
interest requirements applicable to  reorganizations under Section 368(a) of
the Code, then NewAlliance shall reduce  the aggregate number of Cash
Election Shares, and thereby the aggregate Cash  Election Consideration, by
the minimum extent necessary to enable each of such  tax opinions to be
rendered, and correspondingly increase the aggregate number  of shares of
Westbank Common Stock to be converted into the Stock Election  Price.

 



 

3.1.8 Each  unvested restricted share of Westbank Common Stock granted under
the Westbank  Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the date
the Westbank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shareholders  approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
vest and become  free of restrictions at the close of business on the day
the Westbank  shareholders  approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or such earlier date  as  may be agreed to by NewAlliance or
provided under the terms of the Westbank  Stock  Plan.

 



 

**3.2** **_Proration  and Election Procedures_**.  The  Parties acknowledge
that for United States federal income tax purposes it is  intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions  of Section
368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is  adopted as a
plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the  Code.
Consistent with that intent, notwithstanding any provision of this  Agreement
to the contrary, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all  holders
of Westbank Common Stock shall include such number of shares of  NewAlliance
Common Stock as is necessary in order that the aggregate number  of  shares
of Westbank Common Stock exchanged through the Merger for shares of 
NewAlliance Common Stock is fifty percent (50%) of the total number of
shares  of  Westbank Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective  Time (the "Stock Conversion Number"). Subject to the Stock
Conversion Number,  holders of Westbank Common Stock may elect to receive
shares of NewAlliance  Common Stock or the Cash Election Price in exchange
for their shares of Westbank  Common Stock in accordance with the following
procedures.

 



 

3.2.1 An  election form ("Election Form") will be sent by NewAlliance no
later than  fifteen (15) Business Days and no earlier than thirty (30)
Business Days prior  to the expected Effective Time (provided that it need
not be sent until the  approvals from the Bank Regulators as set forth in
Section 8.3 have been  obtained) to each holder of record of Westbank Common
Stock permitting such  holder (or in the case of nominee record holders, the
beneficial owner through  proper instructions and documentation) to elect to
receive, subject to the  pro-ration procedures described in Section 3.2.2,
(i) all NewAlliance Common  Stock with respect to each share of such
holder\'s Westbank Common Stock, as  provided herein (the "Stock Election
Shares"); (ii) all cash with respect to  each share of such holder\'s
Westbank Common Stock, as provided herein (the  "Cash  Election Shares") or
(iii) a combination of Stock Merger Consideration  consisting of a mixture of
Stock Election Consideration and Cash Election  Consideration with respect to
each share of such holder\'s Westbank Common Stock,  as provided herein. Any
shares of Westbank Common Stock with respect to which  the holder thereof
shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made such an  election by
submission to the Exchange Agent on an effective, properly completed 
Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares ("Non-Election  Shares").

 



 

3.2.2 The  term  "Election Deadline", as used below, shall mean 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern time, on  a  date determined by NewAlliance, which date shall not be
earlier than the  fifteenth (15th)  Business Day following but not including
the date of mailing of the Election  Form or such other date as NewAlliance
and Westbank shall mutually agree upon,  provided in any event, the Election
Deadline shall be at or before the Effective  Time. Any election to receive
NewAlliance Common Stock or cash shall have been  properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly  completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be  revoked or changed
by the Person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange  Agent by written
notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice is actually  received,
including by facsimile, by the Exchange Agent at or prior to  the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Election  Deadline. The Certificate or Certificates representing Westbank
Common Stock  relating to any revoked Election Form shall be promptly
returned without charge  to the Person submitting the Election Form to the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange  Agent shall have discretion to determine when
any election, modification or  revocation is received and whether any such
election, modification or revocation  has been properly made. The Exchange
Agent shall promptly calculate the  allocation, if any, among holders of
Westbank Common Stock of rights to receive  the Stock Election Price and the
Cash Election Price as follows:

 



 

If  the  number of Stock Election Shares does not equal the Stock Conversion
Number,  then  the Stock Election Shares and the Cash Election Shares will
be converted into  the right to receive NewAlliance Common Stock and cash in
the following  manner:

 



 

(a) If  the  aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (the "Stock Election
Number") exceeds  the Stock Conversion Number, then all Westbank Cash
Election Shares and all  Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right  to  receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock
Election Shares of each holder thereof  will be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration in respect  of that number of Stock Election
Shares equal to the product obtained by  multiplying (x) the number of Stock
Election Shares held by such holder by  (y) a  fraction, the numerator of
which is the Stock Conversion Number and the  denominator of which is the
Stock Election Number, with the remaining number  of  such holder\'s Stock
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive  the Cash Election
Consideration; and

 



 

(b) If  the  Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount  by  which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
Election Number being  referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then
all Stock Election Shares  shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and the  Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares
shall be treated in the following  manner:

 



 

(i) If  the  Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares,  then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive  the  Cash Election Consideration and the Non-Election
Shares of each holder thereof  shall be converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration in respect  of that number of Non-Election Shares
equal to the product obtained by  multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election
Shares held by such holder by (y)  a  fraction, the numerator of which is
the Shortfall Number and the denominator  of  which is the total number of
Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number  of  such holder\'s Non-
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive  the  Cash
Election Consideration; or

 



 

(ii) If  the  Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares,
then all  Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Stock  Election Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder
thereof shall  be  converted into the right to receive the Stock Election
Consideration in respect  of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by  multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held
by such holder by (y)  a  fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
which (1) the Shortfall Number  exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election
Shares and the denominator of  which  is the total number of Cash Election

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shares,  with the remaining number of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares
being converted  into the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration.

 

 



 

**3.3** **_Procedures  for Exchange of Westbank Common Stock_**.

 



 

3.3.1 _NewAlliance  to Make Merger Consideration Available_.  At or  before
the Effective Time, NewAlliance shall deposit, or shall cause to be 
deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Westbank  Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3,
certificates  representing the shares of NewAlliance Common Stock sufficient
to pay the Stock  Election Price and an estimated amount of cash sufficient
to pay the aggregate  Cash Election Consideration and the aggregate
Fractional Share Consideration  payable hereunder (such cash and certificates
for shares of NewAlliance Common  Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being  hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").

 



 

3.3.2 _Exchange  of Certificates_.  No  later than 3 Business Days after
the Effective Time, NewAlliance shall take  all  steps necessary to cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a  Certificate or Certificates,
a form letter of transmittal for return to the  Exchange Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the  Certificates for, as
the case may be, certificates representing the shares  of  NewAlliance
Common Stock, cash in respect of the Cash Election Price, and cash  in
respect of the Fractional Share Price. The letter of transmittal (which 
shall  be subject to the reasonable approval of Westbank) shall specify that
delivery  shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass,  only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent.
Upon proper  surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent,  together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the  holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor,  as  applicable, (i) a certificate representing that
number of shares (if any) of  NewAlliance Common Stock to which such former
holder of Westbank Common Stock  shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.1.2 hereof,  (ii) a check representing that amount of
cash (if any) to which such former  holder of Westbank Common Stock shall
have become entitled in respect of the  Cash Election Price pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.1.3 hereof, and  (iii) a check representing the
amount of cash (if any) payable in respect of  the  Fractional Share Price,
which such former holder has the right to receive in  respect of the
Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Section  3.1.5, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No  interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu of fractional  shares.
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person who is an  "affiliate" of
Westbank for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act  shall not be
exchanged for certificates representing shares of NewAlliance  Common Stock
until NewAlliance has received the written agreement of such Person 
contemplated by Section 8.4 hereof.

 



 

3.3.3 _Rights  of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_.  The 
holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and 
outstanding Westbank Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective 
Time, with respect to such Westbank Common Stock except to surrender the 
Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this 
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective 
Time  with respect to NewAlliance Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any  unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such  Certificate in accordance with Section 3.3. After the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

surrender  of a Certificate in accordance with Section 3.3, the record holder
thereof  shall  be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any  interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares  of  NewAlliance Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.

 



 

3.3.4 _Surrender  by Person Other than Record Holders_.  If the  Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of 
transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition 
of  the payment of the Stock Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate
is  properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock
powers,  in either case signed exactly as the name of the record holder
appears on such  Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer,
or is accompanied  by  appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person
surrendering such  Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so
on behalf of the  record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the  Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of  the  payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate  surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the  satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not  payable.

 



 

3.3.5 _Closing  of Transfer Books_.  From  and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer  books of Westbank of the
Westbank Common Stock that was outstanding immediately  prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,  they  shall be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in  this 
Section 3.3.

 



 

3.3.6 _Return  of Exchange Fund_.  At any  time following the six (6) month
period after the Effective Time, NewAlliance  shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions  of  the Exchange Fund
which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not  disbursed to
holders of Certificates (including, without limitation, all  interest and
other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all  funds  made
available to it), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look  to 
NewAlliance (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) 
with  respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender  of  the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither  NewAlliance nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a  Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such 
Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat 
or  other similar law.

 



 

3.3.7 _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_ _._   In the  event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be  lost, 
stolen or destroyed and, if required by NewAlliance, the posting by such
person  of a bond in such amount as NewAlliance may reasonably direct as
indemnity  against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate,  NewAlliance or the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen  or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect  thereof.

 



 

3.3.8 _Withholding_ _._   NewAlliance or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from  the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the  transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of
Westbank Common Stock such  amounts as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

NewAlliance  (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and  withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any  applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S.
tax law. To  the  extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
NewAlliance or the Exchange  Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement  as having been paid to the holder of the
Westbank Common Stock in respect of  whom such deduction and withholding were
made by NewAlliance or the Exchange  Agent.

 



 

3.3.9  _Reservation  of Shares_.  Effective upon the date of this
Agreement, NewAlliance shall reserve for  issuance a sufficient number of
shares of the NewAlliance Common Stock for  the  purpose of issuing shares
of NewAlliance Common Stock to the Westbank  shareholders in accordance with
this Article III.

 



 

3.3.10  _Listing  of Additional Shares_.  Prior  to the Effective Time,
NewAlliance shall notify the NYSE of the additional  shares of NewAlliance
Common Stock to be issued by NewAlliance in exchange  for  the shares of
Westbank Common Stock.

and subject to applicable laws relating to exchange of information,  Westbank
will permit NewAlliance and its officers, employees, counsel,  accountants
and other authorized representatives, access, upon reasonable  notice, to its
personnel and properties and those of the Westbank Subsidiaries,  and shall
disclose and make available to NewAlliance during normal business  hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time all of the books, papers 
and records of Westbank or any Westbank Subsidiary relating to the assets, 
properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not
limited  to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax
records, minute  books of directors\' (other than minutes that discuss any of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or other strategic
alternatives) and  shareholders\' meetings, organizational documents, Bylaws,
material contracts  and  agreements, filings with any regulatory authority,
litigation files, plans  affecting employees, and any other business
activities or prospects in which  NewAlliance may have a reasonable interest;
provided, however, that Westbank  shall not be required to take any action
that would provide

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  to  or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or  prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any
customer or  other Person or would result in the waiver by it of the
privilege protecting  communications between it and any of its counsel. In
addition, Westbank and  the  Westbank Subsidiaries shall not be required to
disclose any analysis, minutes,  or other materials pertaining to the
financial or other evaluation or discussion  of (i) this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein, or (ii) any  third  party proposal to
acquire a controlling interest in Westbank. Westbank shall  provide and shall
request its auditors to provide NewAlliance with such  historical financial
information regarding Westbank and any Westbank Subsidiary  (and related
audit reports and consents) as NewAlliance may reasonably request  for
securities disclosure purposes. NewAlliance shall use reasonable efforts 
to  minimize any interference with Westbank\'s and any Westbank Subsidiary\'s
regular  business operations during any such access to Westbank\'s or any
Westbank  Subsidiary\'s personnel, property, books or records. Westbank and
its  Subsidiaries shall permit NewAlliance, at NewAlliance\'s expense, to
cause  so-called "Phase I Environmental Site Assessments" and/or "Phase II 
Environmental Site Assessments" to be performed at any physical location
owned  or operated by Westbank or any Westbank Subsidiary and, to the extent
Westbank  or the applicable Westbank Subsidiary has the contractual right to
do so, at  any  Loan Property or Participation Facility. NewAlliance agrees
to indemnify and  hold harmless, Westbank, each Westbank Subsidiary, and any
landlord or other  Persons with an interest in the real property, from and
against any damages,  claims, losses or expenses of any kind, including
reasonable attorneys fees,  pertaining to or arising from any entry onto, or
any assessments or other  studies undertaken by NewAlliance with respect to,
any such real property under  this Section.

 



 

**6.4** **_Financial  and Other Statements_**.

 



 

6.4.1 Promptly  upon receipt thereof, Westbank will furnish to NewAlliance
copies of each  annual, interim or special audit of the books of Westbank and
the Westbank  Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and/or its
internal auditors  and copies of all internal control reports submitted to
Westbank by such  accountants and/or internal auditors in connection with
each annual, interim  or  special audit of the financial statements of
Westbank and the Westbank  Subsidiaries made by such accountants and/or
internal auditors.

 



 

6.4.2 As  soon  as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents  are  filed with the SEC, Westbank will deliver to
NewAlliance any and all Securities  Documents filed by it with the SEC under
the Securities Laws. As soon as  practicable, Westbank will furnish to
NewAlliance copies of all such financial  statements and reports as it or any
Westbank Subsidiary shall send to its  shareholders, the FDIC, the FRB, the
Division or any other regulatory authority,  except as legally prohibited
thereby.

 



 

6.4.3 Westbank  will advise NewAlliance promptly of the receipt of any
examination report of  any  Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or
activities of Westbank or any  of  the Westbank Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.4.4 Westbank  will promptly furnish to NewAlliance such additional
financial data as  NewAlliance may reasonably request, including without
limitation, detailed  monthly loan reports, deposit reports, asset liability
reports, pricing  committee reports, liquidity reports and investment
reports. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**6.5** **_Maintenance  of Insurance_**.  Westbank shall continue to
maintain, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to  continue to maintain, such
insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to cover  such risks as are
consistent with its past practices.

 



 

**6.6** **_Disclosure  Supplements_**.  From  time to time prior to the
Effective Time, Westbank and WB will promptly  supplement or amend the
Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection  herewith with respect
to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing,  occurring or known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required  to be  set forth or
described in such Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is  necessary to
correct any information in such Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which  has been
rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment  to  such
Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall be deemed to have modified the 
representation, warranties and covenants for the purpose of determining 
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX. Notwithstanding
anything  to the contrary contained herein, no failure to provide any such
supplement  or  amendment to the Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall
constitute the failure  of  any condition set forth in Article IX to be
satisfied unless the underlying  breach or inaccuracy would individually or
in the aggregate result in the  failure of a condition set forth in Article
IX to be satisfied.

 



 

**6.7** **_Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties_**.  Westbank shall use
all reasonable best efforts in good faith to obtain as soon  as practicable
all consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or  desirable for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement and the
Bank Merger Agreement. Without limiting the generality of  the  foregoing,
Westbank shall utilize the services of a professional  proxy-soliciting firm
to help obtain the shareholder vote required to be  obtained by it hereunder.

 



 

**6.8** **_Reasonable  Best Efforts_**.  Subject  to the terms and
conditions herein provided, Westbank shall use its reasonable  best efforts
in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to  do,  or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable 
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement.

 



 

**6.9** **_Failure  to Fulfill Conditions_**.  In the  event that Westbank
determines that a condition to its obligation to complete  the Merger or the
Bank Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive  that condition,
it will promptly so notify NewAlliance.

 



 

**6.10** **_Acquisition  Proposals_**.  (a)  Westbank agrees that neither
it nor any of Westbank\'s Subsidiaries shall, and  that it shall direct and
use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to cause  its and each such
Subsidiary\'s directors, officers, employees, agents and  representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly  encourage or
otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal  or  offer
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Westbank further agrees that 
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and 
use  its reasonable best efforts in good faith to cause its and each such 
Subsidiary\'s directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives not 
to,  directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any  confidential information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any Person  relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly
facilitate any  effort or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prevent Westbank or its Board
of Directors  from (A) complying with its disclosure obligations under
federal or state law;  (B) providing information in response to a request
therefor by a Person who  has  made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Westbank  Board  of Directors receives from the
Person so requesting such information an executed  confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to that entered into with  NewAlliance; (C) engaging in
any negotiations or discussions with any Person  who  has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or (D)  recommending such
an Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of Westbank,  if  and only to
the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C)  or  (D)
above, (i) the Westbank Board of Directors determines in good faith (after 
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action would be required 
in  order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties
under  applicable law, (ii) the Westbank Board of Directors determines in
good faith  (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal,  if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated,
taking into account all  legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making  the proposal, and would, if consummated,
result in a transaction more favorable  to Westbank\'s shareholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger,  and  (iii) the shareholders of
Westbank have not yet approved this Agreement at  the  Westbank Shareholders
Meeting. An Acquisition Proposal which is received and  considered by
Westbank in compliance with this Section 6.10 and which meets  the 
requirements set forth in clause (D) of the preceding sentence is herein 
referred to as a "Superior Proposal." Westbank agrees that it will
immediately  cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or  negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any  Acquisition Proposals. Westbank agrees that it will notify
NewAlliance orally  within one (1) Business Day, with written notice to
follow within three (3)  Business Days thereafter, if any such inquiries,
proposals or offers are  received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions  or  negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with Westbank or any of  its  representatives after the date
hereof, and the identity of the person making  such inquiry, proposal or
offer and the substance thereof and will keep  NewAlliance informed of any
material developments with respect thereto  immediately upon the occurrence
thereof.

 



 

(b) In  the  event that the Board of Directors of Westbank determines in
good faith, after  consultation with its financial advisor and upon advice
from outside counsel,  that it desires to accept a Superior Proposal, it
shall notify NewAlliance  in  writing of its intent to terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into an  acquisition agreement or similar
agreement (each an "Acquisition Agreement")  with respect to, or recommend
acceptance of, the Superior Proposal. Such notice  shall specify all of the
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and  identify the Person
making such Superior Proposal. NewAlliance shall have five  Business Days to
evaluate and respond to Westbank\'s notice. If NewAlliance  delivers to
Westbank in writing prior to the expiration of the five Business  Day 
period provided above (x) an amendment to Sections 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 of 
this Agreement increasing the Merger Consideration to an amount, and (y) 
adjusting other material terms and conditions such that they are at least
equal  to that of such Superior Proposal (the "NewAlliance Amendment"), as
determined  by Westbank\'s Board of Directors in the good faith exercise of
its fiduciary  duties after consultation with its financial advisors and
counsel, then Westbank  shall accept the NewAlliance Amendment and reject the
Superior Proposal.  Westbank shall have five Business Days to evaluate the
NewAlliance  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) In  the  event that the Board of Directors of Westbank determines under
Section 6.10(b)  that the NewAlliance Amendment is not at least equal to the
Superior Proposal,  Westbank can terminate this Agreement in order to execute
an Acquisition  Agreement with respect to, or to allow its Board to adopt a
resolution  recommending acceptance to Westbank\'s shareholders of, the
Superior Proposal  as  provided in Section 11.1.9.

 



 

**6.11** **_Board  of Directors and Committee Meetings_**.  Westbank shall
provide to NewAlliance (a) notice of any and all meetings of  its  Board of
Directors, Executive Committee, and Loan Committee, which notice shall  be no
less timely than the notice required to be provided to Westbank\'s or 
WB\'s  directors, and (b) copies of all written materials (i) accompanying
any such  notices, (ii) presented to the participants of any and all such
meetings, and  (iii) copies of drafts of meeting minutes and credit memoranda
produced with  respect to such meeting at such time as customarily provided
to Westbank\'s  or  WB\'s directors, excluding, however, any materials
pertaining to NewAlliance,  the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any third party proposal to  acquire a controlling interest in
Westbank or WB.

 



 

**6.12** **_Reserves  and Merger-Related Costs_**.  Not  earlier than sixty
(60) days before the anticipated Effective Time, to the  extent consistent
with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable  banking laws
and regulations, Westbank shall establish such additional accruals  and
reserves as may be necessary to conform the accounting reserve practices 
and  methods (including credit loss practices and methods) of Westbank and WB
to  those of NewAlliance (as such practices and methods are to be applied
to  Westbank and WB from and after the Closing Date) and NewAlliance\'s plans
with  respect to the conduct of the business of Westbank and WB following the
Merger  and otherwise to reflect Merger-related expenses and costs incurred
by Westbank,  provided, however, that Westbank shall not be required to take
such action  unless NewAlliance agrees in writing that (i) all conditions to
Closing set  forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.3 have been satisfied or waived
(except for the  expiration of any applicable waiting periods relating to any
governmental  approvals) and (ii) all opinions, certificates, letters and
other documents  to  be received by NewAlliance, Westbank or WB on the
Closing Date have been  delivered into escrow fully signed, and subject only
to the expiration of any  governmental waiting period. Prior to the delivery
by NewAlliance of the writing  referred to in the preceding sentence,
Westbank shall provide NewAlliance a  written statement, certified without
personal liability by the chief executive  officer of Westbank and dated that
date of such writing, that the representation  made in Section 4.22.1 hereof
with respect to Westbank\'s allowance for possible  loan losses is true as of
such date in all material respects or, alternatively,  setting forth in
detail the circumstances that prevent such representation  from  being true
as of such date; and no accrual or reserve made by Westbank or any  Westbank
Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or any litigation or regulatory 
proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute a
breach  of this Agreement within the meaning of Section 11.1.2 hereof. No
action shall  be required to be taken by Westbank pursuant to this Section
6.12 if, in the  opinion of Westbank\'s independent auditors, such action
would contravene GAAP.  The recording of any such adjustments shall not be
deemed to imply any  misstatement of previously furnished financial
statements or information and  shall not be construed as concurrence of
Westbank or its management with any  such adjustments.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**   6.13** **_Transaction  Expenses of Westbank_**. 

 



 

6.13.1 For  planning purposes, Westbank shall, within ten (10) days from the
date hereof,  provide NewAlliance with Westbank\'s estimated budget of
transaction-related  expenses reasonably anticipated to be payable by
Westbank in connection with  this transaction, including the fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants,  investment bankers and other
professionals. Westbank shall promptly notify  NewAlliance if or when it
determines that it expects to exceed its  budget.

 



 

**6.14** **_Certain  Policies of Westbank_**.  Upon  the request of
NewAlliance and NAB, Westbank and WB shall, consistent with  GAAP  and
regulatory accounting principles, use their reasonable best efforts to 
record certain accounting adjustments to the policies of Westbank and WB so 
as  to reflect the policies of NewAlliance and NAB and to implement internal
control  procedures which are consistent with NewAlliance\'s and NAB\'s
current internal  control procedures to allow NewAlliance to fulfill its
reporting requirement  under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
provided, however, that  Westbank and WB shall not be obligated to record any
such accounting adjustments  or implement any internal control procedures
pursuant to this Section 6.14  unless and until Westbank and WB shall be
satisfied that the conditions to  the  obligation of the parties to
consummate the Merger will be satisfied or waived  on or before the Effective
Time and in no event until the day prior to the  Effective Date. Westbank\'s
and WB\'s representations, warranties and covenants  contained in this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in  any  respect for
any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes  undertaken
solely on account of this Section 6.14.

 



 

**6.15** **_Amendments  to Plans_** **.**

 



 

6.15.1 With  respect to each Westbank Employee Plan subject to Section 409A
of the Code,  Westbank agrees to amend each such plan or cause each such plan
to be amended  to  the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the
Code (or to cause such  plan, in whole or in part, to avoid the application
of Section 409A of the  Code  by preserving the terms of such plan, and the
law in effect, for benefits earned  and vested as of December 31, 2004) prior
to the earlier of the Effective Time  or the deadline imposed by the IRS.
Such amendments shall be provided to  NewAlliance and its counsel at least
ten days prior to their proposed adoption  by Westbank or WB and shall be
subject to the prior approval of NewAlliance,  which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

6.15.2 Prior  to  December 31, 2006, Westbank shall amend its Money Purchase
Pension plan and  its  401(k) Retirement Plan (to the extent practicable
under applicable law) in  order  to exclude from the compensation covered by
such plans the following items:  (a)  any compensation recognized with
respect to stock options or restricted stock  awards subsequent to June 30,
2006, (b) any severance payments, including any  severance to be prepaid in
2006, and (c) the payment of benefits pursuant to  any  Westbank Employee
Plan, including the supplemental retirement plan agreements.  Such amendments
shall be provided to NewAlliance and its counsel at least ten  days prior to
their proposed adoption by Westbank or WB and shall be subject  to  the
prior approval of NewAlliance, which shall not be unreasonably  withheld. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**6.16** **_Acceleration  of Restricted Stock Awards_** **.**   Westbank 
shall take, or shall cause the committee administering the Westbank Stock
Plan  to take, all action necessary to cause each unvested restricted share
of  Westbank Common Stock to become vested and free of restrictions as of the
date  specified in Section 3.1.8 hereof.

 



 

**6.17** **_WB  Severance Payments_** **.**   WB shall  pay those of its
employees who are not Continuing Employees, as defined in  Section 7.5.2
hereof, whose employment is terminated as of the Effective Time  other than
for cause, disability or retirement ("Terminated Employees") in  accordance
with a severance plan to be adopted by WB with terms no more generous  than
the Severance Plan, as defined in Section 7.5.4 below.

 



 

**ARTICLE  VII**

 



 

**COVENANTS  OF NEWALLIANCE AND NAB**

 



 

**7.1** **_Disclosure  Supplements_**.  From  time to time prior to the
Effective Time, NewAlliance will promptly supplement  or amend the
NEWALLIANCE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith  with
respect to any material matter hereafter arising which, if existing, 
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required 
to be  set forth or described in such NEWALLIANCE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or
which is  necessary to correct any information in such NEWALLIANCE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE  which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No
supplement or  amendment to such NEWALLIANCE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have
any effect for  the  purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article  IX.

 



 

**7.2** **_Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties_**.  NewAlliance shall
use all reasonable best efforts in good faith to obtain as  soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons necessary  or 
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement.

 



 

**7.3** **_Reasonable  Best Efforts_**.  Subject  to the terms and
conditions herein provided, NewAlliance shall use all  reasonable best
efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all action  and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under 
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger  Agreement.

 



 

**7.4** **_Failure  to Fulfill Conditions_**.  In the  event that
NewAlliance determines that a condition to its obligation to complete  the
Merger or the Bank Merger Agreement cannot be fulfilled and that it will 
not  waive that condition, it will promptly so notify Westbank.

 



 

**7.5** **_Employees  and Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

7.5.1 NAB  anticipates employing branch office customer service employees of
WB and such  other employees of WB as NAB shall reasonably require for the
conduct of NAB\'s  business following the Effective Time. In addition, NAL
and WB may wish to  provide retention bonuses to employees of WB who remain
employed at WB through  the Effective Time, or at NAB for an interim period
following the Effective  Time  as disclosed in Section 7.5.1 of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

NewAlliance  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, and pursuant to a retention agreement
substantially similar  to agreements used by NewAlliance in previous
acquisitions.

 

 

 

 

7.5.2 Except  as  set forth below, each employee of WB who remains employed
by NAB following  the  Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") shall
be entitled to participate  in (i) such of the employee benefit plans,
deferred compensation arrangements,  bonus or incentive plans and/or other
compensation and benefit plans of WB  that  NAB may continue for the benefit
of Continuing Employees following the Effective  Time and (ii) whatever
employee benefit plans and other compensation and benefit  plans that NAB may
maintain for the benefit of its similarly situated employees,  if such
Continuing Employee is not otherwise then participating in a similar  plan of
WB then provided by NAB, in each case other than as set forth in the 
Termination, Release and Noncompetition Agreements or the Termination and 
Release Agreements referred to in Section 7.5.7 hereof. The parties hereto 
acknowledge that Continuing Employees shall not be entitled to receive any 
specific level of grants under any stock option plan or restricted stock
plan  of  NewAlliance. Any grants that may be made to the Continuing
Employees under  any  of such plans will be subject to the sole discretion
of the Board of Directors  of NewAlliance or the committee administering such
plans. Continuing Employees  shall be eligible to participate in all
NewAlliance employee benefit plans  in  accordance with plan documents,
including, but not limited to, NewAlliance\'s  401(k) plan, employee stock
ownership plan and defined benefit plan. Continuing  Employees shall not
receive credit for service with Westbank and the Westbank  Subsidiaries under
any existing NewAlliance employee plan or any NewAlliance  benefit plan in
which such employees would be eligible to enroll for any  purposes under any
NewAlliance benefit plan, except as set forth below. With  respect to the
NewAlliance defined benefit pension plan, each Continuing  Employee shall be
credited with service as a WB employee for purposes of  determining
eligibility to participate and vesting under such plan (but not  for 
purposes of benefit accrual); with respect to the NewAlliance employee stock 
ownership plan, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with service as  a
WB  employee for purposes of determining eligibility to participate under
such  plan  and for purposes of vesting under Section 7.4(b)(1) of the
employee stock  ownership plan only with respect to employer matching
contributions related  to  the NewAlliance 401(k) plan (but not in any event
for purposes of benefit  accrual or for vesting of any other amounts under
the employee stock ownership  plan, including but not limited to employer
contributions made pursuant to  Section 4.1(b) of the employee stock
ownership plan); and with respect to the  NewAlliance 401(k) plan, each
Continuing Employee shall be credited with service  as a WB employee for
purposes of determining eligibility and vesting.  NewAlliance and NAB shall
credit the accrued but unused vacation and sick time  of the Continuing
Employees at the Effective Time under the applicable policies  of Westbank,
as set forth on Section 7.5.2 of the Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE.  Nothing
herein shall limit the ability of NewAlliance to amend or terminate  any  of
the Westbank Employee Plans in accordance with their terms at any time after 
the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, NewAlliance shall become the plan 
sponsor of each Westbank Employee Plan. Westbank agrees to take or cause to 
be  taken such actions as NewAlliance may reasonably request to give effect
to  such  assumption. NewAlliance shall have the right and power at any time
following  the  Effective Time to amend or terminate or cease benefit
accruals under any  Westbank Employee Plan or cause it to be merged with or
its assets and  liabilities to be transferred to a similar plan maintained
by  NewAlliance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.5.3 If  Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in a medical,
dental, health  or disability plan which is a NewAlliance Employee Plan,
NewAlliance shall  cause  each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent  such conditions are covered under the
applicable medical, health, dental or  disability plans that are NewAlliance
Employee Plans and are covered under  the  applicable medical, health,
dental or disability plans that are Westbank  Employee Plans, (ii) credit
under such plans any deductible, co-payment and  out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the employees and their covered dependents  during the portion of
the plan year prior to such participation and (iii) waive  any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which  would otherwise be
applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time,  unless such
employee had not yet satisfied any similar limitation or requirement  under
an analogous Westbank Employee Plan prior to the Effective  Time.

 



 

7.5.4 NAB  and  NewAlliance shall pay and provide severance benefits to
Continuing Employees  as  provided under the NAB and NewAlliance severance
plan (a copy of which has  been  provided to Westbank and is referred to as
the "Severance Plan") treating  service with Westbank, WB and any Westbank
Subsidiary as service with NAB and  NewAlliance for all purposes (providing
benefits as if the Severance Plan had  been adopted by Westbank, WB, and all
Westbank Subsidiaries prior to the  Effective Time) in accordance with its
terms as in effect on the date of this  Agreement for a period of twelve
months following the Effective Time. 

 



 

7.5.5 For  a  period of six months following the Effective Time, NewAlliance
shall make  available (through written or intra-net notice) to Continuing
Employees of  Westbank, WB or a Westbank Subsidiary notification regarding
opportunities  for  positions with NewAlliance or NAB, and shall respond to
inquiries concerning  open positions at NewAlliance from any former employees
of Westbank, WB or  a  Westbank subsidiary, whose employment was terminated
at or following the  Effective Time other than for cause, disability or
retirement ("Terminated  Employees") and shall consider any application
submitted by such persons,  provided, however, that any decision to offer
employment to any such person  shall be made in the sole discretion of
NewAlliance.

 



 

7.5.6 Section  7.5.6 of the Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE contains all
employment and change  of  control, severance, deferred compensation,
retirement, salary continuation  and  similar agreements, arrangements,
policies or programs with any employee or  director of Westbank or any
Westbank Subsidiary and all Westbank Employee Plans  ("Benefit Agreements").
At and following the Effective Time, NewAlliance shall  honor, and the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform,  in
accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations of Westbank existing 
as  of the Effective Time under the Benefit Agreements other than those
employment  agreements and change in control agreements covered by the
Termination, Release  and Noncompetition Agreements or the Termination and
Release Agreements  referenced in Section 7.5.7 hereof. NewAlliance
acknowledges that the  consummation of the Merger will constitute a "change-
in-control" of Westbank  for  purposes of any of the Benefit Agreements of
Westbank (except where otherwise  set forth in Section 7.5.6 of the Westbank
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE). Any employee  or  director of Westbank or any of its
Subsidiaries who is a party to an agreement  which has been set forth in
Section 7.5.6 of the Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE  excluding the employment
agreements and change in control agreements covered  by  the Termination,
Release and Noncompetition Agreements or the Termination and  Release
Agreements referenced in Section 7.5.7 hereof (with the agreements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  excluded referred to herein as the "Executive Agreements") who becomes
entitled  to benefits thereunder shall be entitled to receive the cash
benefits payable  under such agreement at the time and in the amounts
provided for by the  agreement; provided, however, that the employee or
director executes and  delivers to NewAlliance an instrument in form and
substance satisfactory to  NewAlliance acknowledging that the employee or
director has received the payment  in full satisfaction of his or her rights
under such agreement. To the extent  that an employee of Westbank or any of
its Subsidiaries is entitled to the  continued receipt of health insurance,
life insurance, disability insurance,  or  other similar fringe benefits
pursuant to an Executive Agreement, and such  employee becomes an officer,
employee or consultant of NewAlliance or any of  its  Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time and as a result becomes entitled  to  receive the same
fringe benefits in his or her capacity as an officer, employee  or consultant
of NewAlliance or any of its Subsidiaries, then the fringe  benefits provided
to such person shall be deemed to be provided in connection  with such
person\'s service as an officer, employee or consultant of NewAlliance  or
any of its Subsidiaries for so long as such person serves in such capacity 
and shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to (and for the sole purpose to 
avoid duplication of benefits), the same fringe benefits that would have 
otherwise been provided pursuant to the Executive Agreement.

 



 

7.5.7 Concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement by the parties
hereto, (i) each of Donald  R. Chase, Gary L. Briggs and John M. Lilly shall
enter into a Termination,  Release and Noncompetition Agreement with
Westbank, WB, and NewAlliance  substantially in the form of _Exhibit  C_  
hereto,  and (ii) each of Kathleen A. Jalbert and Trenton E. Taylor shall
enter into  a  Termination and Release Agreement with Westbank, WB and
NewAlliance  substantially in the form of _Exhibit  D_   hereto.

 



 

The  dollar amounts to be paid to each of the officers named in this Section
7.5.7  are set forth on Section 7.5.7 of the NEWALLIANCE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE.
In  consideration of the amounts to be paid to the officers named in this
Section  7.5.7 pursuant to their respective Termination, Release and
Noncompetition  Agreements or Termination and Release Agreements, Westbank
and WB agree that  they will make no severance or other change in control
payments or benefits  to  such officers pursuant to the existing employment
or change of control  agreements with such officers.

supplemental retirement  plan ("SERP") agreement with Westbank or WB and who
has not yet reached his  normal retirement age under such agreement, Westbank
or WB shall pay a lump  sum  cash amount to such participant immediately
prior to the Effective Time in  an  amount equal to such participant\'s
accrued liability retirement account under  such agreement (which accrued
amount for each participant as of December 31,  2006 is set forth in Section
4.14.8 of the Westbank DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE), with  the SERP agreement to be
terminated as of the Effective Date. In addition,  Westbank and WB shall
notify the trustee and the benefits determiner under  each  of the rabbi
trusts for such SERP agreements of the payments to be made pursuant  to this
section.

**7.6** **_Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_**.

 



 

7.6.1 NewAlliance  shall maintain in effect for six (6) years following the
Effective Time the  current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policies maintained by  Westbank and the Westbank Subsidiaries (provided,
that NewAlliance may  substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms  and  conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters  occurring prior to the Effective Time
**; ** provided,  however, that in no event shall NewAlliance be required to
expend in the  aggregate pursuant to this Section 7.6.1 more than 200% of the
annual cost  currently expended by Westbank with respect to such insurance
(the "Maximum  Premium Amount"). In connection with the foregoing, Westbank
agrees to provide  such insurer or substitute insurer with such
representations as such insurer  may  request with respect to the reporting
of any prior claims. Notwithstanding  the  above, Westbank may, in
consultation with NewAlliance, purchase "tail coverage"  for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time for its officers  and  directors
provided the cost for such coverage in the aggregate does not exceed  the
Maximum Premium Amount. If such coverage is purchased, NewAlliance shall 
not  be required to provide the insurance set forth in this Section  7.6.1.

 



 

7.6.2 NewAlliance  shall, and/or shall cause the appropriate NewAlliance ****
Subsidiary  to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or who has  been  at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before
the Effective Time,  an  officer or director of Westbank or WB (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all  losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorney\'s fees),  liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement (which  settlement shall require the prior
written consent of NewAlliance, which consent  shall not be unreasonably
withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action,  suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative  (each a "Claim"),
in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be  made,  a party or
witness in whole or in part or arising in whole or in part out of  the  fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Westbank  or
a  Westbank Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising,  existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation,  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of  whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after,
the Effective Time  (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent
permitted under  applicable state or federal law and under Westbank\'s
Articles of Organization  and Bylaws. NewAlliance shall pay expenses,
including reasonable attorney\'s  fees, in advance of the final disposition
of any such action or proceeding  to  each Indemnified Party to the full
extent permitted by applicable state or  federal law upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advance payments if  he  or she shall be
adjudicated or determined not to be entitled to indemnification  in the
manner set forth below. Any __ Indemnified  Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.6.2 upon learning  of  any Claim, shall
notify NewAlliance (but the failure so to notify NewAlliance  shall not
relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section  7.6.2,
except to the extent such failure prejudices NewAlliance) and shall  deliver
to NewAlliance the undertaking referred to in the previous sentence.  In 
the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective 
Time)  (1) NewAlliance shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (in
which  event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter)  and upon such assumption NewAlliance shall not be liable to any
Indemnified  Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incurred  by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if  NewAlliance elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for
the Indemnified  Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that
there are or may be  (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues
which raise conflicts  of  interest between NewAlliance and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified  Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to them, and NewAlliance  shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified  Parties, (2) NewAlliance shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay  for only one (1) firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties whose reasonable  fees and expenses shall be paid
promptly as statements are received unless  there  is a conflict of interest
that necessitates more than one (1) law firm, (3)  NewAlliance shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior  written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (4)  no  Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect  to  a matter as
to which (x) he shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not  to  have
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or 
not  opposed to, the best interests of Westbank or any Westbank Subsidiary,
or (y)  in  the event that a proceeding is compromised or settled so as to
impose any  liability or obligation upon an Indemnified Party, if there is a
determination  that with respect to said matter said Indemnified Party did
not act in good  faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the  best interests of Westbank or any Westbank Subsidiary.
The determination shall  be made by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
the Directors of  NewAlliance who are not involved in such proceeding.

 



 

**7.7** **_Conduct  of Business_** **. ** Except  with the written consent
of Westbank, during the period from the date of this  Agreement to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this  Agreement,
NewAlliance will operate its business, and it will cause each of  the 
NewAlliance Subsidiaries to operate its business, only in the usual, regular 
and  ordinary course of business; use its reasonable best efforts in good
faith  to  preserve intact its business organization and assets, keep
available the present  services of the employees, maintain its rights and
franchises, and preserve  the  goodwill of its customers and others with
whom business relationships exist;  and  voluntarily take no action which
would or be reasonably likely to (i) adversely  affect the ability of
NewAlliance or NAB to obtain any necessary approvals  of  Governmental
Entities required for the transactions contemplated hereby or  under  the
Bank Merger Agreement or increase the period of time necessary to obtain 
such approvals, or (ii) adversely affect its ability to perform its
covenants  and agreements under this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement.
Subject  to the forgoing qualifications (i) and (ii), nothing herein shall be
interpreted  as precluding NewAlliance or NAB from entering into agreements
with respect  to  or consummating mergers with or acquisitions of other
companies at any  time.

 



 

**7.8** **_Financial  and Other Statements_**.

 



 

7.8.1 Promptly  upon receipt thereof, NewAlliance will furnish to Westbank
copies of each  annual, interim or special audit of the books of NewAlliance
and the NewAlliance  Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and/or
its internal auditors  and copies of all internal control reports submitted
to NewAlliance by such  accountants and/or internal auditors in connection
with each annual, interim  or  special audit of the financial statements of

prohibited thereby.

financial data as Westbank  may  reasonably request, including without
limitation, detailed monthly loan  reports.

 



 

**7.9** **_Current  Information_**. **** During  the period from the date of
this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective  Time  or the termination of
this Agreement, NewAlliance will cause one or more of  its  representatives
to confer with representatives of Westbank and report on the  general status
of its ongoing operations at such times as Westbank may  reasonably request.
NewAlliance will promptly notify Westbank of any material  change from the
normal course of business of NewAlliance or NAB or in the  operation of the
properties of NewAlliance or NAB and, to the extent permitted  by applicable
law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings  (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the 
institution or the threat of material litigation involving NewAlliance or
NAB. 

 



 

**7.10** **_Negative  Covenants_**. **** NewAlliance  agrees that from the
date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective  Time  or the
termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically permitted  or
required by this Agreement, or consented to by Westbank in writing which 
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed,
NewAlliance  will not, and will cause each of the NewAlliance Subsidiaries
not  to;

 



 

(a) make  any  change in its accounting methods or practices, except changes
as may be required  by GAAP, PCAOB accounting pronouncements or by law or
regulatory  requirements;

 



 

(b) take  any  action that would result in the representations and
warranties of NewAlliance  and any NewAlliance Subsidiary contained in this
Agreement not being true and  correct in all material respects on the date of
this Agreement or at the Closing  Date;

 



 

(c) take  any  action that is intended or is reasonably likely to result in
(x) any of its  representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
being or becoming  untrue in any material respect at the Effective Time, (y)
any of the conditions  to the Merger set forth in Article IX not being
satisfied or (z) a material  violation of any provision of this Agreement or
the Bank Merger Agreement,  except, in each case, as may be required by
applicable law or regulation;  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) take  any  action that would prevent or impede the Merger or the Bank
Merger from  qualifying as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a)  of  the Code; or

 



 

(e) agree  to  do any of the foregoing.

 



 

**7.11** **_Access  to Properties and Records_**. **** In  order  to
facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger and the 
integration of the business and operations of the parties, subject to
Section  12.1 hereof and subject to applicable laws relating to exchange of
information,  NewAlliance shall permit Westbank and its officers, employees,
counsel,  accountants and other authorized representatives, access, upon
reasonable  notice, to its personnel and properties and those of the
NewAlliance  Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to Westbank
during normal  business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time all of the  books, papers and records of NewAlliance or any NewAlliance
Subsidiary relating  to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and
liabilities, including,  but not limited to, all books of account (including

minutes that discuss any of  the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or other strategic alternatives)  and  shareholders\' meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts  and  agreements,
filings with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans  affecting
employees, and any other business activities or prospects in which  Westbank
may have a reasonable interest; provided, however, that NewAlliance  shall
not be required to take any action that would provide access to or to 
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice  the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or
other person  or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications  between it and any of its counsel. In addition, NewAlliance
and the NewAlliance  subsidiaries shall not be required to disclose any
analysis, minutes, or other  materials pertaining to the financial or other
evaluation or discussion of  (i)  this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereunder, or (ii) any third  party proposal to acquire a
controlling interest in NewAlliance. NewAlliance  shall provide and shall
request its auditors to provide Westbank with such  historical financial
information regarding NewAlliance and any NewAlliance  Subsidiary (and
related audit reports and consents) as Westbank may reasonably  request for
securities disclosure purposes. Westbank shall use reasonable  efforts to
minimize any interference with NewAlliance\'s and any NewAlliance 
Subsidiary\'s regular business operations during any such access to
NewAlliance\'s  or any NewAlliance Subsidiary\'s personnel, property, books
or  records.

 



 

**7.12** **_Stock  Listing_** **.**   NewAlliance agrees to list on the NYSE

issued in the Merger.

 



 

**7.13** **_Stock  and Cash Reserve_** **.**   NewAlliance agrees at all
times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger  Consideration has
been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares  of  NewAlliance

**REGULATORY  AND OTHER MATTERS**

 



 

**8.1** **_Westbank  Special Meeting_**.

 



 

Westbank  will, in accordance with applicable law and Westbank\'s Articles of
Organization  and Bylaws, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable take all
steps necessary  to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its shareholders  (the "Westbank Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of
approving the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for such
other purposes as  may  be, in Westbank\'s and NewAlliance\'s reasonable
judgment, necessary or desirable,  (ii) subject to the fiduciary
responsibility of the Board of Directors of  Westbank as advised by counsel,
recommend to its shareholders the approval  of  the aforementioned matters
to be submitted by it to its shareholders and oppose  any third party
proposal or other action that is inconsistent with this  Agreement or the

each of the foregoing matters. Except with the prior approval of
NewAlliance,  no other matters shall be submitted for approval of the

**8.2** **_Proxy  Statement - Prospectus_**.

 



 

8.2.1 For  the  purposes of (x) registering NewAlliance Common Stock to be
offered to holders  of  Westbank Common Stock in connection with the Merger
with the SEC under the  Securities Act and applicable state securities laws
and (y) holding the Westbank  Shareholders Meeting, NewAlliance, at its
expense, shall draft and prepare,  and  Westbank shall cooperate in the
preparation of, an S-4 registration statement  for the registration of the
shares to be issued by NewAlliance in the Merger  (the "Merger Registration
Statement"), including a proxy statement and  prospectus satisfying all
applicable requirements of applicable state securities  and banking laws, and
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules  and regulations
thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed  by Westbank
to the Westbank shareholders, together with any and all amendments  or
supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the "Proxy  Statement-
Prospectus"). NewAlliance shall provide Westbank and its counsel  with 
appropriate opportunity to review and comment on the Merger Registration 
Statement and Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to the time they are
initially  filed with the SEC or any amendments are filed with the SEC.
NewAlliance shall  file the Merger Registration Statement with the SEC. Each
of NewAlliance and  Westbank shall use its best efforts to have the Merger
Registration Statement  declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after  such filing, and Westbank shall thereafter
promptly mail the Proxy  Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders.
NewAlliance shall also use its best  efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits  and  approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  and Westbank shall furnish
to NewAlliance all information concerning Westbank  and the holders of
Westbank Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in  connection with such
action.

 



 

8.2.2 Westbank  shall provide NewAlliance with any information concerning
Westbank and its  Subsidiaries that NewAlliance may reasonably request in
connection with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafting  and preparation of the Merger Registration Statement and Proxy 
Statement-Prospectus, and each party shall notify the other promptly of the 
receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Merger Registration 
Statement or Proxy Statement-Prospectus and of any requests by the SEC for 
any  amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
provide  to Westbank promptly copies of all correspondence between it or any
of its  representatives and the SEC. NewAlliance shall provide Westbank and
its counsel  with appropriate opportunity to review and comment on all
amendments and  supplements to the Merger Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement-Prospectus  and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments  prior to their being filed with, or sent
to, the SEC. Each of NewAlliance and  Westbank agrees to use all reasonable
efforts, after consultation with the  other  party hereto, to respond
promptly to all such comments of and requests by the  SEC and to cause the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all required amendments  and  supplements
thereto to be mailed to the holders of Westbank Common Stock  entitled to
vote at the Westbank Shareholders Meeting referred to in Section  8.1 
hereof at the earliest practicable time.

 



 

8.2.3 Westbank  and NewAlliance shall promptly notify the other party if at
any time it becomes  aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger
Registration Statement  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material  fact  required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements contained  therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not  misleading. In such event, Westbank shall
cooperate with NewAlliance in the  preparation of a supplement or amendment
to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus  which corrects such misstatement or
omission, and NewAlliance shall file an  amended Merger Registration
Statement with the SEC, and Westbank shall mail  an  amended Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to Westbank\'s shareholders. Westbank, on  the  one
hand, and NewAlliance on the other shall each provide to the other a 
"comfort" letter from its independent registered public accountant, dated as 
of  the date of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and updated as of the
Effective  Date  of the Merger, with respect to certain financial
information regarding Westbank  and NewAlliance in the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus, respectively, each in form  and substance which is customary in
transactions such as the Merger, unless  waived by the Parties.

 



 

**8.3** **_Regulatory  Approvals_**.  Each of  Westbank, WB and NewAlliance
will cooperate with the other and use all  reasonable efforts to promptly
prepare all necessary documentation, to effect  all necessary filings and to
obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals  and authorizations of all
third parties and governmental bodies necessary to  consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without  limitation
the Merger and the Bank Merger. Westbank and NewAlliance will furnish  each
other and each other\'s counsel with all information concerning themselves, 
their subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other
matters  as may be necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy 
Statement-Prospectus and any application, petition or any other statement or 
application made by or on behalf of NewAlliance, NAB, Westbank or WB to any 
governmental body in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, and the
other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall
have the  right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information  relating to such party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear
in any filing  made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with  any  governmental body. In addition, NewAlliance, NAB,
Westbank and WB shall each  furnish to the other for review a copy of each
such filing made in connection  with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any governmental  body  prior to its filing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**8.4** **_Affiliates_**.  Westbank shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
each director, executive  officer and other Person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145  under the Securities Act) of Westbank to deliver to
NewAlliance, as soon as  practicable after the date of this Agreement and in
no event later than thirty  (30) days after the date this Agreement, a
written agreement, in the form of  _Exhibit  E_   hereto,  providing that
such Person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose  of any
shares of NewAlliance Common Stock to be received by such "affiliate,"  as 
a result of the Merger except in compliance with the applicable provisions 
of  the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



 

**8.5** **_Compliance  with Anti-Trust Laws_**.  Each of  NewAlliance and
Westbank shall use reasonable best efforts in good faith to  resolve
objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to the Merger  under
anti-trust laws. In the event a suit is threatened or instituted  challenging
the Merger as violative of anti-trust laws, each of NewAlliance  and 
Westbank shall use reasonable best efforts in good faith to avoid the filing 
of,  or resist or resolve such suit. NewAlliance and Westbank shall use
reasonable  best efforts in good faith to take such action as may be
required: (a) by the  FRB, the Department, the Division, the Board of Bank
Incorporation and the  Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the United States
Federal Trade Commission  in  order to resolve such objections as any of
them may have to the Merger under  antitrust laws, or (b) by any federal or
state court of the United States,  in  any suit brought by a private party
or Governmental Entity challenging the  Merger as violative of antitrust
laws, in order to avoid the entry of, or to  effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or  other  order which has the
effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger.  Reasonable best efforts
in good faith shall not include, among other things  and  only to the extent
NewAlliance so desires, the willingness of NewAlliance to  accept an order
agreeing to the divestiture, or the holding separate, of any  assets of
NewAlliance or Westbank.

 



 

**8.6** **_Execution  of Bank Merger Agreement_**.  Contemporaneously with
the execution of this Agreement, WB and NAB each shall  execute and deliver
the Bank Merger Agreement, substantially in the form  attached hereto as
_Exhibit  A_.

forth the  facts, assumptions and representations on which such counsel may
rely in  rendering its opinion.

**ARTICLE  XI**

 



 

**TERMINATION,  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

**11.1** **_Termination_**.  This  Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date, whether  before or after approval of the Merger by
the shareholders of  WestBank:

 



 

11.1.1 By  the  mutual written agreement of NewAlliance and Westbank;

 



 

11.1.2 By  either  NewAlliance or Westbank, provided that the terminating
party is not then in  material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement  contained herein, if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the  representations or warranties set forth in
this Agreement on the part of the  other party, which breach (i) by its
nature cannot be cured, or (ii) shall  not  have been cured within thirty
(30) days after written notice by the  non-breaching party to the breaching
party, provided that, in the event the  breach cannot reasonably be cured
within the specified thirty (30) day period,  the time to cure shall be
extended to such time as reasonably may be necessary  to effect the cure, not
to exceed an additional thirty (30) days (sixty (60)  days in the aggregate),
conditioned upon the breaching party commencing to  cure  the breach within
fifteen (15) days after notice of the breach, providing  written notice to
the non-breaching party within such fifteen (15) day period  of  the
breaching party\'s inability to complete the cure within the specified
thirty  (30) day period and thereafter diligently and continuously
prosecuting the  cure  to completion. For purposes of this Section 11.1.2, a
material breach shall  be  deemed to be a breach which has, either
individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on (x) the party
making such representations or  warranties or (y) the consummation of the
Merger, the Bank Merger, and the  other  transactions contemplated hereby,
provided, that if the applicable  representation or warranty by its terms
already is limited to a Material Adverse  Effect, this provision shall not be
deemed to further limit or qualify the  representation or warranty;

 



 

11.1.3 By  either  NewAlliance or Westbank, provided that the terminating
party is not then in  material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement  contained herein, if there shall have been a
material failure to perform or  comply with any of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement  on  the part of the other party,
including also any failure to satisfy a condition  to Closing, which failure
(i) by its nature cannot be cured, or (ii) shall  not  have been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice by the  non-breaching party to
the breaching party, provided that, in the event the  breach cannot
reasonably be cured within the specified thirty (30) day period,  the time to
cure shall be extended to such time as reasonably may be necessary  to effect
the cure, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days (sixty (60)  days in
the aggregate), conditioned upon the breaching party commencing to  cure 
the breach within fifteen (15) days after notice of the breach, providing 
written notice to the non-breaching party within such fifteen (15) day
period  of  the breaching party\'s inability to complete the cure within the
specified thirty  (30) day period and thereafter diligently and continuously
prosecuting the  cure  to completion. For purposes of this Section 11.1.3, a
material failure to  perform or comply shall be deemed to be a failure which
has, either individually  or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
(x) the party so failing  or  (y) the consummation of the Merger, the Bank
Merger, and the other transactions  contemplated hereby, provided, that if
the applicable

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance  obligation by its terms already is limited to a Material Adverse
Effect, this  provision shall not be deemed to further limit or qualify the
performance  obligation;

 



 

11.1.4 By  (a)  Westbank, if the Merger Registration Statement shall not
have been declared  effective, within the meaning of the Securities Laws, by
the SEC by December  31,  2006, or (b) either NewAlliance or Westbank, if
the Closing shall not have  occurred by the Termination Date, or such later
date as shall have been agreed  to in writing by NewAlliance and Westbank;
provided, that no party may terminate  this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.1.4 if the failure to achieve  effectiveness of the Merger
Registration Statement or of the Closing to have  occurred on or before said
date was due to such party\'s breach of any of its  obligations under this
Agreement;

 



 

11.1.5 By  either  NewAlliance or Westbank if the shareholders of Westbank
shall have voted at  the  Westbank shareholders meeting on this Agreement
and such vote shall not have  been sufficient to approve the Agreement;

 



 

11.1.6 By  either  NewAlliance or Westbank if (i) final action has been
taken by a Governmental  Entity whose approval is required in connection with
this Agreement or the  Bank  Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, which  final action (x) has become non-
appealable and (y) does not approve this  Agreement or the Bank Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby  or thereby, (ii) any
regulatory authority whose approval or non-objection is  required in
connection with this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement and  the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, has stated in writing that it 
will  not issue the required approval or non-objection, or (iii) any court
of  competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority shall have issued
an  order, decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining
or  otherwise prohibiting the Merger or the Bank Merger and such order,
decree,  ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable,
any of the  foregoing being termed an "Adverse Action", provided that each
party shall  use  their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary approvals  from  any applicable Governmental Entity and to timely
and fully address any  objections raised or questions posed by such
Governmental Entity;

 



 

11.1.7 By  NewAlliance if at any time prior to the Westbank Shareholder
meeting, (a)  Westbank shall have materially breached Section 6.10 of this
Agreement, (b)  the  Westbank Board of Directors shall have failed for any
reason to make its  recommendation referred to in Section 8.1, withdrawn such
recommendation or  modified or changed such recommendation in a manner
adverse in any respect  to  the interests of NewAlliance or (c) Westbank
shall have materially breached  its  obligations under Section 8.1 by
failing to call, give notice of, convene and  hold the Westbank Shareholders
Meeting in accordance with Section  8.1.

 



 

11.1.8 By  NewAlliance if a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of
the  outstanding shares of Westbank Common Stock is commenced (other than
by  NewAlliance), and the Westbank Board of Directors recommends that the 
shareholders of Westbank tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer  or  otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such
tender offer  or  exchange offer within the ten-Business Day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a)  under the Exchange Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.1.9 At  any  time prior to the Westbank Shareholders Meeting, by Westbank
in order to  concurrently enter into an acquisition agreement or similar
agreement (each,  an  "Acquisition Agreement") with respect to a Superior
Proposal which has been  received and considered by Westbank and the Westbank
Board of Directors in  compliance with Section 6.10 hereof, provided,
however, that this Agreement  may  be terminated by Westbank pursuant to
this Section 11.1.9 only after the fifth  (5th)  Business Day following
NewAlliance\'s receipt of written notice from Westbank  advising NewAlliance
that Westbank is prepared to enter into an Acquisition  Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, and only if, during such five  (5)-Business
Day period, NewAlliance does not, in its sole discretion, make  an  offer to
Westbank that Westbank\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith,  after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is at least as  favorable
as the Superior Proposal.

 



 

**11.2** **_Effect  of Termination_**.

 



 

11.2.1 In  the  event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to any
provision of Section  11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no further force,  except that the provisions of Sections 11.1, 11.3,
12.1, 12.2, 12.6, 12.9,  12.10, this Section 11.2, and any other Section
which, by its terms, relates  to  post-termination rights or obligations,
shall survive such termination of this  Agreement and remain in full force
and effect.

 



 

11.2.2 In  the  event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1, except as  provided in Section 11.2.3, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs  and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such  expenses. In the event of a termination of this
Agreement because of a willful  breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in  this  Agreement, the breaching party
shall remain liable for any and all damages,  costs and expenses, including
all reasonable attorneys\' fees, sustained or  incurred by the non-breaching
party as a result thereof or in connection  therewith or with respect to the
enforcement of its rights  hereunder.

 



 

11.2.3 In  recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities
foregone by  NewAlliance while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the
parties hereto agree  that Westbank shall pay to NewAlliance a termination
fee of $4,500,000 (the  "Westbank Termination Fee") in the manner and subject
to the conditions set  forth below if:

 



 

(i) this  Agreement is terminated by NewAlliance pursuant to Sections 11.1.7
or  11.1.8;

 



 

(ii) this  Agreement is terminated by Westbank pursuant to Section 11.1.9; or

 



 

(iii) this  Agreement is terminated by (A) NewAlliance pursuant to Section
11.1.2 or 11.1.3  or (B) by either NewAlliance or Westbank pursuant to
Section 11.1.5, and in  the  case of any termination pursuant to Section
11.1.2, 11.1.3 or 11.1.5 an  Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise  communicated or made known to the senior management
of Westbank or the Westbank  Board (or any Person shall have publicly
announced, communicated or made known  an intention,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any time
after the  date  of this Agreement and prior to the date of termination of
this Agreement  in the  case of clause (A), or the date of the vote of the
shareholders of Westbank  in  the case of clause (B), and in any such event,
Westbank or WB enters into  any  agreement with respect to, or consummates,
an Acquisition Transaction within  twelve (12) months after such termination
of this Agreement.

 

 



 

In  the  event the Westbank Termination Fee shall become payable pursuant to
Section  11.2.3 (i) or (ii), Westbank shall pay to NewAlliance the Westbank
Termination  Fee on or before the third Business Day following the date of
termination of  this Agreement. In the event the Westbank Termination Fee
shall become payable  pursuant to Section 11.2.3 (iii), Westbank shall pay to
NewAlliance the Westbank  Termination Fee on the date of execution of such
agreement or consummation  of  the Acquisition Transaction. Any amount that
becomes payable pursuant to this  Section 11.2.3 shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds  to  an account designated by
NewAlliance.

 



 

11.2.4 If  payment of the Westbank Termination Fee is timely made, then
NewAlliance will  not have any other rights or claims against Westbank, any
Westbank Subsidiaries,  or their respective officers and directors, under
this Agreement, it being  agreed that the acceptance of the Westbank
Termination Fee under Section 11.2.3  will constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of NewAlliance against Westbank,  any Westbank Subsidiaries, or their
respective officers and directors. If  Westbank fails to pay the amounts due
under Section 11.2.3 above within the  time  period specified therein,
Westbank shall pay the costs and expenses (including  reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by NewAlliance in connection with  any action in which
it prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit taken  to  collect payment
of such amount, together with interest on the amount of any  such  unpaid
amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as  published
in _The  Wall Street Journal_ ,  calculated on a daily basis from the date
such amounts were required to be  paid  until the date of actual payment.

 



 

**11.3** **_Amendment,  Extension and Waiver_**.  Subject  to applicable
law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether before  or  after
approval thereof by the shareholders of Westbank), the parties hereto  by 
action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend this
Agreement,  (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other  acts  of any other party hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations  and  warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, or  (d)  waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein;  provided, however, that after any
approval of this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby by the
shareholders of Westbank, there may  not  be, without further approval of
such shareholders, any amendment of this  Agreement which reduces the amount,
value or changes the form of consideration  to be delivered to Westbank\'s
shareholders or Option holders pursuant to this  Agreement. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing  signed on behalf of
each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of  a  party hereto to
any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in  an  instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party, but such waiver or failure  to
insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or 
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any 
subsequent or other failure.

an Agreement  and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 18, 2006 (the "Merger
Agreement");  and

 



 

WHEREAS,  Section 7.5.7 of the Merger Agreement provides that NewAlliance,

forth herein;

 



 

NOW  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and
valuable  consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged,  the  Executive, WBC, Westbank and NewAlliance agree as
follows:

 



 

1. _Actions  to be Taken in 2006_.

 



 

(a) The  Executive hereby agrees to take the following actions between the
date hereof  and December 29, 2006, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all  of  such actions shall be fully effective and consummated
no later than December  29,  2006 (or such other date as may be specified
below):

 



 

(i) consent,  to the extent any such consent is required by the Executive, to
the accelerated  vesting as of the date the shareholders of WBC approve the
Merger Agreement  of  all unvested restricted stock awards granted to the
Executive with respect  to  the common stock of WBC, provided that any
unvested restricted stock awards  scheduled to vest prior to such date shall
vest on their originally scheduled  vesting date;

 



 

(ii) exercise  on or before December 22, 2006 all non-qualified stock options
held by the  Executive to purchase the common stock of WBC;

 



 

(iii) accept  a  lump sum cash payment from WBC or Westbank on December 22,
2006 in the amount  of  $_______ (with applicable withholding taxes to be
subtracted from such amount),  representing a partial prepayment of the cash
severance the Executive is  entitled to under Section 9(b)(iv) of the
Employment Agreement;

 



 

(iv) accept  a  lump sum cash payment from WBC or Westbank on December 22,
2006 in the amount  of  $_________ (with applicable withholding taxes to be
subtracted from

such  amount), in full satisfaction of both WBC's obligations under Section
9(b)(vii)  of the Employment Agreement and NewAlliance's agreement to extend
such benefits  to cover the years 2010 and 2011;

 



 

(v) accept  on  or before December 29, 2006 such prepayment, if any, of the
dollar amount  specified in Section 2(a) below that may be mutually agreed to
by WBC and  NewAlliance in order to avoid the potential reduction in payments
under Section  2(c) below; and

 



 

(vi) cooperate  with NewAlliance and WBC and take such other steps as may in
good faith be  requested of the Executive by NewAlliance in order to avoid
the potential  reduction in payments under Section 2(c) below.

 



 

(b) WBC  shall  take all steps necessary to accelerate as of the date the
shareholders of WBC  approve the Merger Agreement the vesting of all of the
unvested restricted  stock  awards granted to the Executive, and WBC or
Westbank shall pay to the Executive  on December 22, 2006 the amounts
specified in Sections 1(a)(iii) and (iv)  above.

 



 

(c) In  the  event the above actions are taken but are insufficient to avoid
the potential  reduction in payments under Section 2(c) below, then WBC or
Westbank shall  prepay to the Executive on or before December 29, 2006 such
portion of the  dollar amount specified in Section 2(a) below as shall be
mutually agreed to  by  WBC and NewAlliance (which agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld or  delayed).

 



 

2. _Payments  to Be Made as of the Effective Time of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) As  of the  Effective Time of the Merger, provided the Executive is
still employed by WBC  immediately prior to such date and provided that the
Executive and WBC have  taken all of the actions required to be taken
pursuant to Section 1 hereof,  and  in consideration of the obligations and
commitments of the Executive under  this  Agreement, WBC or Westbank shall
pay to the Executive a lump sum cash amount  equal to $_________, subject to
adjustment as set forth in Section 2(c) below  (the "Maximum Amount"), less
applicable tax withholdings and less any portion  thereof that is prepaid in
December 2006 pursuant to Sections 1(a)(v) and 1(c)  above. In consideration
of such payment and the other provisions of this  Agreement, the Executive,
WBC, Westbank and NewAlliance hereby agree that the  Employment Agreement and
the Executive's employment with WBC shall be terminated  without any further
action of any of the parties hereto, effective immediately  prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, except as set forth in Section 4  hereof. The
Executive agrees that the above payment shall be in complete  satisfaction of
all of his rights to payments or benefits under the Employment  Agreement,
except as set forth in Section 4 hereof.

 



 

(b) WBC  and  the Executive represent and warrant that the information with
respect to the  Executive contained in Section 4.14.8 of the WBC Disclosure
Schedule to the  Merger Agreement accurately reflects the Executive's taxable
Form W-2 income for  each of the four years ended December 31, 2005 and
contains a complete listing  of all payments or benefits to the Executive
that could be deemed to be a  parachute payment under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  as  amended (the "Code"), based on the
assumptions set forth in such  schedule.

(c) Each  of  the parties hereto agrees that if the actions specified in
Section 1 above  are  taken as required, then based on Section 2(b) above
the payments and benefits  to  be provided to the Executive should not
trigger any tax reimbursement payments  pursuant to Section 12 of the
Employment Agreement. In the event any of the  actions specified in Section 1
above is not taken as required, or if any of  the  representations in
Section 2(b) is not correct, and if such failure results  in  the Maximum
Amount, either alone or together with other payments and benefits  which the
Executive has the right to receive from NewAlliance, WBC or Westbank, 
whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, being a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, then the Maximum Amount payable by
WBC or  Westbank pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof shall be reduced by the
amount which  is  the minimum necessary to result in no portion of the
payment payable by WBC  or  Westbank under Section 2(a) being non-deductible
to WBC, Westbank or NewAlliance  (or any successors thereto) pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code and subject  to  the excise tax imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code. If any of the payments  or  benefits to be
provided by WBC, Westbank or NewAlliance are subject to the  excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code but are not required to be  reduced by
this Section 2(c), then the indemnity under Section 12 of the  Employment
Agreement (which section remains in full force and effect pursuant  to 
Section 4 of this Agreement) shall be provided to the Executive by
NewAlliance;  provided, however, that if the amount of the indemnity is known
as of the  Effective Time of the Merger, then such indemnity shall be
provided by either  WBC or Westbank at the request of NewAlliance.

 



 

(d) As  of the  Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Date of the
Merger, provided  the  Executive is still employed by WBC immediately prior
to such date, WBC or  Westbank shall pay to the Executive an additional lump
sum cash amount equal  to  $_________, less applicable tax withholdings, in
complete satisfaction of all  of  the Executive's rights to payments or
benefits under the Executive Supplemental  Retirement Plan Agreement between
the Executive and Westbank (formerly Park  West  Bank and Trust Company)
dated July 2, 2001 (the "SERP Agreement"). In  consideration of such payment,
the parties hereto agree that the SERP Agreement  shall be terminated without
any further action of any of the parties hereto  on  or before the date of
such payment in accordance with the terms of the Merger  Agreement.

 



 

(e) As  of the  Effective Time of the Merger, the Executive shall be given
the opportunity  to  purchase the automobile currently provided to him by
Westbank at the purchase  price specified in the motor vehicle lease
agreement covering such automobile  if  he wishes to do so, provided that in
no event shall such fair market value  be  less than the greater of (i) the
Kelley blue book value of such automobile  as of  the Effective Time, or
(ii) WBC's book value or residual leasehold interest in  such automobile as
of the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) The  parties hereto agree that the payments pursuant to Sections
1(a)(iii), (iv)  and  (v) above should not trigger any of the excise taxes
or interest penalties  under  Section 409A of the Code based on the current
provisions of such section and  the  proposed regulations issued under
Section 409A of the Code. However, in the  event the final regulations issued
under Section 409A are construed so as to  impose the excise tax and interest
penalties specified under Section 409A of  the  Code on any of the payments
under Sections 1(a)(iii), (iv) or (v) of this  Agreement, then NewAlliance
shall provide a tax indemnification to the Executive  so that the Executive
is in the same after-tax position he would have been  in if  the excise tax
and interest penalties under Section 409A of the Code had not  been imposed
on such payments; provided, however, that if the amount of the  indemnity is
known as of the Effective Time of the Merger,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C-3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  such  indemnity shall be provided by either WBC or Westbank at the
request of  NewAlliance.

 



 

3. _Payment  of Fringe Benefits_.

 



 

(a) NewAlliance  agrees to provide the Executive with continued health,
dental, life and  disability coverage, pursuant to either the policies
currently offered by WBC  and Westbank or the policies to be offered by
NewAlliance to the Continuing  Employees of WBC, until the earlier of thirty-
six (36) calendar months following  the Effective Time of the Merger or the
Executive's commencement of full-time  employment with a new employer,
subject to the terms and conditions of such  policies, with the Executive
responsible for paying the same share of any  premiums, copayments or
deductibles as if he was an employee and with the  disability and life
insurance coverage subject to the maximum coverage limits  in  the current
policies of WBC or Westbank, except as set forth below in this  Section 3(a).
The health and dental coverage shall include any dependents of  the 
Executive who are covered by WBC or Westbank as of the date of this
Agreement  and who remain covered by WBC or Westbank as of the Effective Time
of the  Merger. In the event the Executive's participation in any such plan
is barred,  NewAlliance shall arrange to provide the Executive with benefits
substantially  similar to those which the Executive would otherwise have
received under such  plans from which his continued participation is barred
or pay to the Executive  a  cash amount equal to the amount NewAlliance
would have paid for such coverage  if  the Executive was still an employee.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the provision of any of the
benefits covered by this Section 3(a) would  trigger the 20% tax and interest
penalties under Section 409A of the Code either  due to the nature of such
benefit or the length of time it is being provided,  then the benefit(s) that
would trigger such tax and interest penalties due  to  the nature of the
benefit shall not be provided at all and the benefit(s) that  would trigger
the tax and interest penalties if provided beyond the "limited  period of
time" set forth in the regulations under Section 409A shall not be  provided
beyond such limited period of time (collectively, the "Excluded  Benefits"),
and in lieu of the Excluded Benefits NewAlliance shall pay to the  Executive,
in a lump sum within 30 days following termination of employment  or  within
30 days after such determination should it occur after termination of 
employment, a cash amount equal to the amount NewAlliance would have paid
for  such Excluded Benefits in the absence of Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(b) In  calculating the value of the benefits to be provided pursuant to
Section 3(a)  above, the parties agree to assume that the premiums in effect
as of August  31,  2006 will increase by 15% per year to cover anticipated
premium increases over  the 36 month period specified in Section 3(a) above.

 



 

4. _Releases_.  Upon  payment of the amounts set forth in Section 2(a) hereof (as such amount may  be  adjusted pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof) and in Section 2(d) hereof, the  Executive, for himself and for his heirs, successors and assigns, does hereby  release completely and forever discharge WBC and its successors from any  obligation under the Employment Agreement, except for the provisions of Sections  12, 13(b) and 13(c) of the Employment Agreement which shall remain in full  force  and effect, and under the SERP Agreement. The obligations of NewAlliance to  provide benefits pursuant to Section 3 above shall continue for the period  specified therein. This Agreement shall not release WBC or NewAlliance from  any  of the following: (a) obligations to pay to the Executive wages earned up to  the  Effective Time of the Merger; (b) the payment of any of the Executive's vested  benefits, or honoring any of the Executive's rights, under the WBC Employee  Plans, excluding any bonus plans, employment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C-4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  or other severance agreement or plan, (c) the payment of the
Merger  Consideration with respect to the Executive's common stock of WBC or
stock  options or restricted stock awards with respect to the common stock of
WBC,  or  (d) the obligations of NewAlliance under Section 7.6 of the
Merger  Agreement.

 



 

5. _Non-Competition  Provisions_.  The  Executive agrees that during the 12-month period immediately following the  Effective Date of the Merger (the "Non-Competition Period"), the Executive will  not (i) engage in, become interested in, directly or indirectly, as a sole  proprietor, as a partner in a partnership, or as a shareholder in a corporation,  or become associated with, in the capacity of employee, director, officer,  principal, agent, trustee or in any other capacity whatsoever, any enterprise  or  entity located in either Hampden County in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  or  Windham County in the State of Connecticut (collectively, the "Counties" and  individually a "County"), which proprietorship, partnership, corporation,  enterprise or other entity is engaged in any line of business conducted by  NewAlliance, NewAlliance Bank or any of their subsidiaries immediately following  the Effective Time of the Merger, including but not limited to entities which  lend money and take deposits (in each case, a "Competing Business"), provided,  however, that this provision shall not prohibit the Executive from owning bonds,  non-voting preferred stock or up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding common  stock of any Competing Business if such common stock is publicly traded, (ii)  solicit or induce, or cause others to solicit or induce, any employee of  NewAlliance or any of its subsidiaries to leave the employment of such entities,  or (iii) solicit (whether by mail, telephone, personal meeting or any other  means, excluding general solicitations of the public that are not based in  whole  or in part on any list of customers of NewAlliance or any of its subsidiaries)  any customer of NewAlliance or any of its subsidiaries to transact business  with  any Competing Business, or to reduce or refrain from doing any business with  NewAlliance or its subsidiaries, or interfere with or damage (or attempt to  interfere with or damage) any relationship between NewAlliance or its  subsidiaries and any such customers.

 



 

6 **.** _Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) This  Agreement shall be construed, enforced and interpreted in
accordance with and  governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut,
without reference to its  principles of conflict of laws, except to the
extent that federal law shall  be  deemed to preempt such state laws.

 



 

(b) It  is the  intention of the parties hereto that the provisions of this
Agreement shall  be  enforced to the fullest extent permissible under all
applicable laws and public  policies, but that the unenforceability or the
modification to conform with  such  laws or public policies of any provision
hereof shall not render unenforceable  or impair the remainder of the
Agreement. The covenants in Section 5 of this  Agreement with respect to the
Counties shall be deemed to be separate covenants  with respect to each
County, and should any court of competent jurisdiction  conclude or find that
this Agreement or any portion is not enforceable with  respect to a County,
such conclusion or finding shall in no way render invalid  or unenforceable
the covenants herein with respect to the other County.  Accordingly, if any
provision shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable  either in whole
or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete  or  modify as
necessary the invalid or unenforceable provisions to alter the balance  of
this Agreement in order to render the same valid and  enforceable.

 



 

(c) The  Executive acknowledges that NewAlliance and NewAlliance Bank would
not have  entered into the Merger Agreement or intend to consummate the
Merger unless  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C-5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  had, among other things, entered into this Agreement. Any breach
of Section  5 of  this Agreement will result in irreparable damage to
NewAlliance and NewAlliance  Bank for which NewAlliance and NewAlliance Bank
will not have an adequate remedy  at law. In addition to any other remedies
and damages available to NewAlliance  and NewAlliance Bank, the Executive
further acknowledges that NewAlliance and  NewAlliance Bank shall be entitled
to seek injunctive relief hereunder to enjoin  any breach of Section 5 of
this Agreement, and the parties hereby consent to  any  injunction issued in
favor of NewAlliance and NewAlliance Bank by any court  of  competent
jurisdiction, without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which 
NewAlliance and NewAlliance Bank may be entitled. The Executive represents 
and  acknowledges that, in light of his experience and capabilities, the
Executive  can obtain employment with other than a Competing Business or in a
business  engaged in other lines and/or of a different nature than those
engaged in by  NewAlliance or its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that the
enforcement of  a  remedy by way of injunction will not prevent the
Consultant from earning a  livelihood. Each of the remedies available to
NewAlliance and NewAlliance Bank  in the event of a breach by the Consultant
shall be cumulative and not mutually  exclusive.

 



 

7. _General_.

 



 

(a) _Heirs,  Successors and Assigns_ **. ** The  terms  of this Agreement
shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective  heirs,
successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) _Final  Agreement_. **** This  Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to  the  subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral.  The terms of this
Agreement may be changed, modified or discharged only by  an  instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto. In the event the  Internal
Revenue Service issues final regulations under Section 409A of the  Code 
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and such regulations are deemed to 
result in the imposition of the excise taxes and/or interest penalties under 
Section 409A of the Code on any of the payments or benefits to be provided 
under  this Agreement, then the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good
faith an  amendment to this Agreement to avoid such excise taxes and/or
interest penalties  to the extent possible, provided that the amounts payable
to the Executive  under  Sections 1, 2(a) and 2(d) of this Agreement shall
not be delayed beyond the  Effective Time of the Merger or reduced in the
aggregate.

 



 

(c) _Withholdings_.  WBC,  Westbank and NewAlliance may withhold from any
amounts payable under this  Agreement such federal, state, local or foreign
taxes as may be required to  be  withheld pursuant to applicable law or
regulation.

 



 

(d) _Defined  Terms_. **** Any  capitalized terms not defined in this
Agreement shall have as their meaning  the  definitions contained in the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Voluntary  Action and Waiver_. **** The  Executive acknowledges that by
his free and voluntary act of signing below,  the  Executive agrees to all
of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally  bound thereby. The
Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult  with an attorney
prior to executing this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall  be  deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and  the  same instrument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C-6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8. _Effectiveness_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall  be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the  Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in  accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated  for  any reason, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void with respect to all  actions not yet taken pursuant to this Agreement.

Agreement  to be executed by their duly authorized officers, and the
Executive has signed  this Agreement, effective as of the date first above

**FORM  OF** **TERMINATION  AND RELEASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This  Termination and Release Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as
of  July 18, 2006 by and among _________________ (the "Executive"),
Westbank  Corporation ("WBC"), a Massachusetts corporation, Westbank, a
Massachusetts  chartered bank and trust company and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of WBC, and  NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. ("NewAlliance"), a Delaware 
corporation.

 



 

RECITALS:

 



 

WHEREAS,  NewAlliance, NewAlliance Bank, WBC and Westbank are entering into
an Agreement  and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 18, 2006 (the "Merger
Agreement");  and

 



 

WHEREAS,  Section 7.5.7 of the Merger Agreement provides that NewAlliance,
WBC, Westbank  and the Executive shall enter into this Agreement, which shall
terminate the  change of control agreement between WBC, Westbank and the
Executive dated  December 17, 2003 (the "Change of Control Agreement") as of
the Effective Time  of the Merger, and in lieu of any rights and payments
under the Change of  Control Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to
the rights and payments  set forth herein;

 



 

NOW  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and
valuable  consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged,  the  Executive, WBC, Westbank and NewAlliance agree as
follows:

 



 

1. _Actions  to be Taken in 2006_.

 



 

(a) The  Executive hereby agrees to take the following actions between the
date hereof  and December 29, 2006, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all  of  such actions shall be fully effective and consummated
no later than December  29,  2006 (or such other date as may be specified
below):

 



 

(i) consent,  to the extent any such consent is required by the Executive, to
the accelerated  vesting as of the date the shareholders of WBC approve the
Merger Agreement  of  all unvested restricted stock awards granted to the
Executive with respect  to  the common stock of WBC, provided that any
unvested restricted stock awards  scheduled to vest prior to such date shall
vest on their originally scheduled  vesting date;

 



 

(ii) accept  a  lump sum cash payment from WBC or Westbank on December 22,
2006 in the amount  of  $_______ (with applicable withholding taxes to be
subtracted from such amount),  representing a partial prepayment of the cash
severance the Executive is  entitled to under Section 6(b) of the Change of
Control  Agreement; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) accept  on  or before December 29, 2006 such prepayment, if any, of
the dollar amount  specified in Section 2(a) below that may be mutually
agreed to by WBC and  NewAlliance in order to avoid the potential reduction
in payments under Section  2(c) below; and

 



 

(iv) cooperate  with NewAlliance and WBC and take such other steps as may in
good faith be  requested of the Executive by NewAlliance in order to avoid
the potential  reduction in payments under Section 2(c) below.

 



 

(b) WBC  shall  take all steps necessary to accelerate as of the date the
shareholders of WBC  approve the Merger Agreement the vesting of all of the
unvested restricted  stock  awards granted to the Executive, and WBC or
Westbank shall pay to the Executive  on December 22, 2006 the amount
specified in Section 1(a)(ii)  above.

 



 

(c) In  the  event the above actions are taken but are insufficient to avoid
the potential  reduction in payments under Section 2(c) below, then WBC or
Westbank shall  prepay to the Executive on or before December 29, 2006 such
portion of the  dollar amount specified in Section 2(a) below as shall be
mutually agreed to  by  WBC and NewAlliance (which agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld or  delayed).

 



 

2. _Payments  to Be Made as of the Effective Time of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) As  of the  Effective Time of the Merger, provided the Executive is
still employed by WBC  immediately prior to such date and provided that the
Executive and WBC have  taken all of the actions required to be taken
pursuant to Section 1 hereof,  WBC  or Westbank shall pay to the Executive a
lump sum cash amount equal to  $_________, subject to adjustment as set forth
in Section 2(c) below (the "Maximum Amount"), less applicable tax
withholdings and less any portion thereof  that is prepaid in December 2006
pursuant to Sections 1(a)(iii) and 1(c) above.  In consideration of such
payment and the other provisions of this Agreement,  the  Executive, WBC,
Westbank and NewAlliance hereby agree that the Change of Control  Agreement
and the Executive's employment with WBC shall be terminated without  any
further action of any of the parties hereto, effective immediately prior 
to  the Effective Time of the Merger, except as set forth in Section 4
hereof.  The  Executive agrees that the above payment shall be in complete
satisfaction of  all  of his rights to payments or benefits under the Change
of Control Agreement,  except as set forth in Section 4 hereof.

 



 

(b) WBC  and  the Executive represent and warrant that the information with
respect to the  Executive contained in Section 4.14.8 of the WBC Disclosure
Schedule to the  Merger Agreement accurately reflects the Executive's taxable
Form W-2 income for  each of the four years ended December 31, 2005 and
contains a complete listing  of all payments or benefits to the Executive
that could be deemed to be a  parachute payment under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  as  amended (the "Code"), based on the
assumptions set forth in such  schedule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Each  of  the parties hereto agrees that if the actions specified in
Section 1 above  are  taken as required, then based on Section 2(b) above
the payments and benefits  to  be provided to the Executive should not
trigger any tax reimbursement payments  pursuant to Section 13 of the Change
of Control Agreement. In the event any  of  the actions specified in Section
1 above is not taken as required, or if any  of  the representations in
Section 2(b) is not correct, and if such failure results  in the Maximum
Amount, either alone or together with other payments and benefits  which the
Executive has the right to receive from NewAlliance, WBC or Westbank, 
whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, being a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, then the Maximum Amount payable by
WBC or  Westbank pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof shall be reduced by the
amount which  is  the minimum necessary to result in no portion of the
payment payable by WBC  or  Westbank under Section 2(a) being non-deductible
to WBC, Westbank or NewAlliance  (or any successors thereto) pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code and subject  to  the excise tax imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code. If any of the payments  or  benefits to be
provided by WBC, Westbank or NewAlliance are subject to the  excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code but are not required to be  reduced by
this Section 2(c), then the indemnity under Section 13 of the Change  of
Control Agreement (which section remains in full force and effect pursuant 
to  Section 4 of this Agreement) shall be provided to the Executive by
NewAlliance;  provided, however, that if the amount of the indemnity is known
as of the  Effective Time of the Merger, then such indemnity shall be
provided by either  WBC or Westbank at the request of NewAlliance.

 



 

(d) As  of the  Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Date of the
Merger, provided  the  Executive is still employed by WBC immediately prior
to such date, WBC or  Westbank shall pay to the Executive an additional lump
sum cash amount equal  to  $_________, less applicable tax withholdings, in
complete satisfaction of all  of  the Executive's rights to payments or
benefits under the Executive Supplemental  Retirement Plan Agreement between
the Executive and Westbank (formerly Park  West  Bank and Trust Company)
dated July 2, 2001 (the "SERP Agreement"). In  consideration of such payment,
the parties hereto agree that the SERP Agreement  shall be terminated without
any further action of any of the parties hereto  on  or before the date of
such payment in accordance with the terms of the Merger  Agreement.

 



 

(e) The  parties hereto agree that the payments pursuant to Sections 1(a)(ii)
and (iii)  above should not trigger any of the excise taxes or interest
penalties under  Section 409A of the Code based on the current provisions of
such section and  the  proposed regulations issued under Section 409A of the
Code. However, in the  event the final regulations issued under Section 409A
are construed so as to  impose the excise tax and interest penalties
specified under Section 409A of  the  Code on any of the payments under
Sections 1(a)(ii) or (iii) of this Agreement,  then NewAlliance shall provide
a tax indemnification to the Executive so that  the Executive is in the same
after-tax position he would have been in if the  excise tax and interest
penalties under Section 409A of the Code had not been  imposed on such
payments; provided, however, that if the amount of the indemnity  is known as
of the Effective Time of the Merger, then such indemnity shall be  provided
by either WBC or Westbank at the request of  NewAlliance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. _Payment  of Fringe Benefits_.

 



 

(a) NewAlliance  agrees to provide the Executive with continued health,
dental, life and  disability coverage, pursuant to either the policies
currently offered by WBC  and Westbank or the policies to be offered by
NewAlliance to the Continuing  Employees of WBC, until the earlier of thirty
(30) calendar months following  the  Effective Time of the Merger or the
Executive's commencement of full-time  employment with a new employer,
subject to the terms and conditions of such  policies, with the Executive
responsible for paying the same share of any  premiums, copayments or
deductibles as if he was an employee and with the  disability and life
insurance coverage subject to the maximum coverage limits  in  the current
policies of WBC or Westbank, except as set forth below in this  Section 3(a).
The health and dental coverage shall include any dependents of  the 
Executive who are covered by WBC or Westbank as of the date of this
Agreement  and who remain covered by WBC or Westbank as of the Effective Time
of the  Merger. In the event the Executive's participation in any such plan
is barred,  NewAlliance shall arrange to provide the Executive with benefits
substantially  similar to those which the Executive would otherwise have
received under such  plans from which his continued participation is barred
or pay to the Executive  a  cash amount equal to the amount NewAlliance
would have paid for such coverage  if  the Executive was still an employee.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the provision of any of the
benefits covered by this Section 3(a) would  trigger the 20% tax and interest
penalties under Section 409A of the Code either  due to the nature of such
benefit or the length of time it is being provided,  then the benefit(s) that
would trigger such tax and interest penalties due  to  the nature of the
benefit shall not be provided at all and the benefit(s) that  would trigger
the tax and interest penalties if provided beyond the "limited  period of
time" set forth in the regulations under Section 409A shall not be  provided
beyond such limited period of time (collectively, the "Excluded  Benefits"),
and in lieu of the Excluded Benefits NewAlliance shall pay to the  Executive,
in a lump sum within 30 days following termination of employment  or  within
30 days after such determination should it occur after termination of 
employment, a cash amount equal to the amount NewAlliance would have paid
for  such Excluded Benefits in the absence of Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(b) In  calculating the value of the benefits to be provided pursuant to

(a) _Heirs,  Successors and Assigns_ **. ** The  terms  of this Agreement
shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective  heirs,
successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) _Final  Agreement_. **** This  Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to  the  subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral.  The terms of this

writing signed by each of the parties hereto. In the event the  Internal
Revenue Service issues final regulations under Section 409A of the  Code 
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and such regulations are deemed to 
result in the imposition of the excise taxes and/or interest penalties under 
Section 409A of the Code on any of the payments or benefits to be provided 
under  this Agreement, then the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good
faith an  amendment to this Agreement to avoid such excise taxes and/or
interest penalties  to the extent possible, provided that the amounts payable
to the Executive  under  Sections 1, 2(a) and 2(d) of this Agreement shall
not be delayed beyond the  Effective Time of the Merger or reduced in the
aggregate.

amounts payable under this  Agreement such federal, state, local or foreign
taxes as may be required to  be  withheld pursuant to applicable law or
regulation.

 



 

(d) _Governing  Law_. **** This  Agreement shall be construed, enforced and
interpreted in accordance with and  governed by the laws of the State of
Connecticut, without reference to its  principles of conflicts of law, except
to the extent that federal law shall  be  deemed to preempt such state laws.

 



 

(e) _Defined  Terms_. **** Any  capitalized terms not defined in this
Agreement shall have as their meaning  the  definitions contained in the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Voluntary  Action and Waiver_. **** The  Executive acknowledges that by
his free and voluntary act of signing below,  the  Executive agrees to all
of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally  bound thereby. The
Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult  with an attorney
prior to executing this Agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall  be  deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and  the  same instrument.

 



 

6. _Effectiveness_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall  be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the  Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in  accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated  for  any reason, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void with respect to all  actions not yet taken pursuant to this Agreement.

[DATE]

 



 

NewAlliance  Bancshares, Inc.

 

195  Church Street

 

New  Haven, Connecticut 06510

 



 

Gentlemen:

 



 

I  have  been advised that I might be considered to be an "affiliate" of
Westbank, a  Massachusetts corporation ("Westbank"), for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and  (d)  of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act").

 



 

NewAlliance  Bancshares, Inc. ("NewAlliance") and Westbank have entered into
an Agreement  and  Plan of Merger, dated as of July 18, 2006 (the
"Agreement"). Upon consummation  of the merger contemplated by the Agreement
(the "Merger"), I may receive shares  of common stock of NewAlliance
("NewAlliance Common Stock") in exchange for  my  shares of common stock,
par value $2.00 per share, of Westbank ("Westbank Common  Stock"). This
agreement is hereinafter referred to as the "Letter  Agreement."

 



 

I  represent and warrant to, and agree with, NewAlliance as follows:

 



 

1. I  have  read this Letter Agreement and the Agreement and have discussed their  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, pledge,  transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of the NewAlliance Common Stock, to  the  extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Westbank.

 



 

2. I  have  been advised that any issuance of shares of the NewAlliance Common Stock to  me  pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC. I have also been  advised, however, that, because I may be an "affiliate" of Westbank at the  time  the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of Westbank and  my  disposition of such shares has not been registered under the Securities Act  of  1933 (the "Securities Act"), I must hold such shares indefinitely unless (i)  such disposition of such shares is subject to an effective registration  statement and to the availability of a prospectus under the Securities Act,  (ii)  a sale of such shares is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d)  under the Securities Act, (iii) a sale of such shares is made following  expiration of the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d)(2) or (3) or  (iv)  in an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to  NewAlliance, I am advised that some other exemption from registration is  available with respect to any such proposed disposition of such  shares.

 



 

3. I  understand and agree that stop transfer instructions will be given to the  transfer agent of NewAlliance with respect to the shares of NewAlliance Common  Stock I receive pursuant to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E-1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Merger  and that there will be placed on the certificate representing such
shares,  or  any certificates delivered in substitution therefor, a legend
stating in  substance:

 



 

The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which  Rule 145 under the Securities Act applies. The shares represented by
this  certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of an
agreement  between the registered holder hereof and NewAlliance, a copy of
which agreement  is on file at the principal offices of NewAlliance. A copy
of such agreement  shall be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon
receipt by  NewAlliance of a written request.

 



 

4. Unless  a  transfer of my shares of the NewAlliance Common Stock is a sale made in  conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), made following expiration of  the  restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d) or made pursuant to any effective  registration statement under the Securities Act, NewAlliance reserves the right  to put an appropriate legend on the certificate issued to my  transferee.

 



 

It  is  understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and
be of  no  further force and effect if the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with  its  terms. It is also understood and agreed that this
Letter Agreement shall  terminate and be of no further force and effect and
the stop transfer  instructions set forth above shall be lifted forthwith
upon the delivery by  the  undersigned to NewAlliance of a copy of a letter
from the staff of the SEC,  an  opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to NewAlliance,  or other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to NewAlliance, to the effect that  a  transfer of my shares of
the NewAlliance Common Stock will not violate the  Securities Act or any of
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. In  addition, it is
understood and agreed that at my request the legend set forth  in  Paragraph
3 above shall be removed forthwith from the certificate or  certificates
representing my shares of the NewAlliance Common Stock upon  expiration of
the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d)(2), so long as  NewAlliance
is then in compliance with SEC Rule 144(c), or if NewAlliance shall  have
received a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, an opinion of  counsel
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to NewAlliance, or other 
evidence satisfactory to NewAlliance that a transfer of my shares of the 
NewAlliance Common Stock represented by such certificate or certificates
will  be  a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), or
made pursuant  to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act.

 



 

5. I  recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse,  (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse\'s occupying my home, (iii) any trust  or  estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial  interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar  capacity and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which I, my spouse  or  any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of  the  equity interest.

 



 

6. Execution  of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission on my part  that  I am an "affiliate" of Westbank as described in the first paragraph of this  Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim  that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this Letter  Agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E-2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

*  * * *  *

 



 

This  Letter Agreement shall be binding on my heirs, legal representatives
and  successors and shall inure to the benefit of NewAlliance\'s successors
and  assigns.

 



 

         |  

Very  truly yours,
