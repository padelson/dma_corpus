       Share that is owned by the Company (or any of its direct or indirect
       wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
       well as each share of the Company's Series A Cumulative Convertible
       Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interests, par value $25.00 per
       share (the "COMPANY PREFERRED SHARES"), that is owned by the Company (or
       any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately
       prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) Sub Share that is owned by Sub (or
       any of Sub's or GGC's direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries)
       immediately prior to the Effective Time, (X) shall automatically be
       cancelled and retired, (Y) shall cease to exist and (Z) no consideration
       shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

            (b) Cancellation of GGC Common Stock. Each share of GGC common stock
       immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) shall automatically be
       cancelled and retired, (ii) shall cease to exist and (iii) no
       consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and, each holder
       of GGC common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
       to have any rights with respect thereto.

            (c) Conversion of Company Common Shares. Each Company Common Share
       issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
       than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.08(a)) (each, a
       "MERGER SHARE") shall be converted into the right to receive the
       following (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"): (i) subject to the Adjustment
       Event provided in Section 7.02 an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest
       whole cent and without interest) equal to $2.20 less the Aggregate
       Hold-

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

       back (defined below) (such amount, the "CASH AMOUNT"); (ii) three
       fiftieths (3/50ths) of an uncertificated right to subscribe (each such
       right, a "SUBSCRIPTION RIGHT") for common stock in the Surviving
       Corporation (the "UNDERLYING SHARES"), in accordance with Section 2.12;
       (iii) an additional amount in cash, without interest, equal to $0.35 (the
       "NOTE CASH AMOUNT" and collectively with the Cash Amount, the "CASH
       CONSIDERATION"), or, subject to the Adjustment Event, and at the option
       of the holder of the Company Common Shares (the "NOTE ELECTION"),
       0.0057461 of a debt security (one such debt security, a "NOTE") backed by
       certain assets of a special-purpose entity, in accordance with Section
       2.13; and (iv) if applicable, the Escrow Distribution Amount (defined
       below) as of the Escrow Distribution Date (defined below), in accordance
       with Section 2.14(b). If and to the extent holders of Company Common
       Shares fail to make an election in connection with the Note Election,
       such shareholders shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Note
       Cash Amount (such holders who elect, or are deemed to elect, to receive
       the Note Cash Amount, the "CASH ELECTORS"). At the Effective Time, all
       Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically
       be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
       that represented any such shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
       (a "COMMON CERTIFICATE") shall cease to have any rights with respect
       thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

                  (1) For purposes of this Section 2.08(c), the "AGGREGATE
                HOLDBACK" shall mean the sum of the Escrow Share Holdback, the
                Dividend Holdback and the Shared Costs Holdback. For purposes
                hereof, the "ESCROW SHARE HOLDBACK" shall mean the Escrow Amount
                (defined below) divided by the aggregate number of Merger
                Shares; the "DIVIDEND HOLDBACK" shall mean the total amount of
                dividends that the Company pays with respect to Company Common
                Shares after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
                divided by the aggregate number of Merger Shares; and the
                "SHARED COSTS HOLDBACK" shall mean one-half of the Shared Costs
                (defined below) divided by the aggregate number of Merger
                Shares.

                  (2) If the Mergers, the Contribution (defined below) and the
                transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated by August
                31, 2002 (the "INTEREST DATE"), the aggregate Cash Amount shall
                be increased by an amount of cash equal to 6% per annum of the
                Cash Consideration (the "CASH CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT");
                provided, however, that no Cash Consideration Adjustment shall
                accrue or be paid in connection with Merger Consideration on
                account of this Section 2.08(c)(2) if the Mergers, the
                Contribution and the transactions contemplated hereby are not
                consummated prior to the Interest Date and (i) as of such date,
                Gotham, GGP, GGC, Sub, FGPI and FGA have complied with their
                respective obligations hereunder or (ii) in the event that such
                persons have not so complied, such noncompliance is primarily
                due to the failure of the Company, the FUMI Share Trust, FUMI or
                their respective subsidiaries to comply with their respective
                obligations hereunder.

                                      -9-

            (d) Conversion of Company Preferred Shares. Subject to the existing
       rights of the Company Preferred Shares, each Company Preferred Share
       issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
       than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.08(a)) shall be
       converted into the right to receive, by way of book entry credit in the
       Surviving Corporation's transfer books, one uncertificated security of
       the Surviving Corporation (the "MIRROR SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES"), with
       the rights and privileges described in the Certificate of Designations
       attached as EXHIBIT B (the "MIRROR SERIES A CERTIFICATE OF
       DESIGNATIONS"), which provides, among other things, that (1) each Mirror
       Series A Preferred Share shall have substantially identical rights as
       each Company Preferred Share and (2) each Mirror Series A Preferred Share
       shall be entitled to one-tenth (1/10th) of the vote attributable to an
       Underlying Share, voting as a class with the Underlying Shares. At the
       Effective Time, all such Company Preferred Shares shall no longer be
       outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
       and each holder of a certificate that represented any such shares
       immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "PREFERRED CERTIFICATE",
       together with Common Certificates, the "CERTIFICATES") shall cease to
       have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Mirror
       Series A Preferred Shares (without interest).

            (e) Conversion of FUMI Shares. Each FUMI Share issued and
       outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
       into the right to receive $10.00 (the "FUMI CASH AMOUNT"). At the
       Effective Time, all such FUMI Shares shall no longer be outstanding,
       shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
       holder of a certificate that represented any such shares immediately
       prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect
       thereto, except the right to receive the FUMI Cash Amount (without
       interest).

            (f) Conversion of Sub Shares. Each Sub Share issued and outstanding
       immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
       cancelled in accordance with Section 2.08(a)) shall be converted into and
       become a fully paid and nonassessable FUMI Share (the "SUB MERGER
       CONSIDERATION"). At the Effective Time, all such Sub Shares shall no
       longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
       to exist, and each holder of a certificate that represented any such
       shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
       rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Sub Merger
       Consideration (without interest).

            Section 2.09. Surrender and Payment; Designation of Paying Agent and
FUMI Agent. (a) Prior to the Registration Statement Effective Date (as defined
below), (i) for the benefit of holders of Company Common Shares and Company
Preferred Shares, GGC shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant
to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to GGC and the
Company), a bank or trust company acceptable to the Company in its reasonable
discretion to act as transfer agent, registrar, paying agent and exchange agent
for (V) the payment of the Merger Consideration and (W) the exchange of Company
Preferred Shares for Mirror Series A Preferred Shares, in each case upon
surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Article II (the "PAYING
AGENT"), from time to time after the Effective Time and (ii) for the benefit of
holders of FUMI Shares and Sub Shares, the Company and GGC shall jointly
designate, or shall cause to be designated, a single representative (the "FUMI
AGENT") to acts as transfer agent, registrar and exchange agent for (X) the
payment of the FUMI Cash

                                      -10-


<PAGE>

Amount and (Y) the payment of the Sub Merger Consideration. The Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall provide on a timely basis to the
Paying Agent and the FUMI Agent, as and when needed after the Effective Time,
cash in amounts sufficient for the payment of the Cash Consideration upon
surrender of the Certificates and for the payment of the FUMI Cash Amount. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledge and agreed that, subject to applicable
law, the delivery of any uncertificated security as part of the Merger
Consideration or Sub Merger Consideration shall be made by book entry credit in
the transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable)
for the account of the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred
Shares, Sub Shares, FUMI Shares or Notes, as the case may be.

            (b) Cash Consideration and Company Preferred Share Exchange
Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in no
event later than the fifth business day following the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Common Certificate and/or a
Preferred Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall comply
with all applicable laws and which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as GGC and the
Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration or Mirror
Series A Preferred Shares, as applicable. Upon surrender by any shareholder of
the Company of any Certificate to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by GGC, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive (in the case of securities, by way of book entry credit in
the Surviving Corporation's transfer books) in exchange therefor (i) the Merger
Consideration due and owing to such holder; or (ii) that number of
uncertificated Mirror Series A Preferred Shares equal to the number of Company
Preferred Shares exchanged therefor, each as applicable. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares that
is not registered in the transfer books of the Company, (i) the proper amount of
Merger Consideration may be paid in exchange for such Company Common Shares or
(ii) the proper number of Mirror Series A Preferred Shares may be exchanged for
such Company Preferred Shares, in each case as applicable, to a person other
than the person in whose name the applicable Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
GGC and the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Paying Agent,
in its capacity as Transfer Agent, Paying Agent and Subscription Rights Agent
(as defined below), will be authorized and instructed to net from any cash owing
to a holder of Company Common Shares any monies due and owing in respect of the
Basic Subscription Privilege (as defined below), the Oversubscription Privilege
(as defined below) or the Over-allotment Right (as defined below), as
applicable.

            (c) Transfer Books; Uncertificated Shares. At the close of business
on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, (i) the transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Shares or
Company Preferred Shares (as applicable) that were

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the transfer books
of Sub shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the transfer books of FUMI of Sub Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, or FUMI Shares or Sub Shares are presented to Sub or the FUMI
Agent, for transfer or for any other reason, such Certificates, FUMI Shares or
Sub Shares, as the case may be, shall be exchanged as provided in this Article
II. Further, in connection with the payment of the Merger Consideration or the
exchange of Company Preferred Shares for Mirror Series A Preferred Shares, the
receipt of Underlying Shares on account of the Basic Subscription Privilege or
the Oversubscription Privilege, any Subscription Rights, Mirror Series A
Preferred Shares or Underlying Shares issued in connection therewith shall be
uncertificated, subject to applicable law. Any transfers in respect of such
Subscription Rights, Mirror Series A Preferred Shares or Underlying Shares shall
be made by book entry on the transfer books of the subject entity.

            (d) No Liability; Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
None of the parties hereto, the Paying Agent or the FUMI Agent shall be liable
to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. All funds held by the
Paying Agent or FUMI Agent for payment to the holders of unsurrendered
Certificates or unsurrendered FUMI Shares, as the case may be, and unclaimed at
the end of one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, after which time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates or FUMI
Shares shall look as a general creditor only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of such funds to which such holder may be due, subject to applicable
law. The foregoing notwithstanding, no dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the Effective Time with respect to the capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation, with a record date after the Effective Time, shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered or unexchanged Certificate or FUMI
Shares with respect to the capital stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable
law, following the surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, issued in exchange
therefor as applicable, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such capital stock.

            (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay or exchange in respect of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration or the Mirror Series A
Preferred Shares, as applicable.

            (f) Withholding Rights. The FUMI Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of FUMI Shares,
Subscription Rights, Underlying Shares, Company Common Shares or Company
Warrants such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of FUMI Shares, Subscription Rights, Underlying
Shares, Company Common Shares or Company Warrants in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the FUMI Agent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.

            Section 2.10. [RESERVED].

            Section 2.11. Warrants. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
warrant (the "WARRANTS") to purchase Company Common Shares pursuant to that
certain Agreement, dated November 2, 1998 by and between Enterprise Asset
Management Company, Inc. and the Company (the "WARRANT AGREEMENT") shall be (i)
adjusted by the Company's Board of Trustees in accordance with the terms of the
Warrant Agreement to reflect any Adjustment Events (as such term is defined in
the Warrant Agreement) and (ii) converted into an obligation of the Company (or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be) to pay, and a right of the holder
thereof to receive in full satisfaction of such Warrant, such consideration as
is required by the terms of the Warrants on account of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.

            Section 2.12. Subscription Rights; Designation of Subscription
Rights Agent; Mechanics. Prior to the Registration Statement Effective Date and
pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to GGC and
the Company, providing for, among other things, the tendering (or, if
applicable, the netting against any Cash Consideration owing to the subject
holder of Company Common Shares) of the applicable per share Subscription Price
(as defined below) by the holders of Company Common Shares as of the Effective
Time upon the valid exercise of Subscription Rights in exchange for Underlying
Shares, GGC shall designate the Paying Agent to act as agent (the "SUBSCRIPTION
RIGHTS AGENT") for (i) the distribution of Subscription Rights by way of book
entry credit in the Company's transfer books for the account of each holder of
Company Common Shares as of the Effective Time; (ii) distribution of Underlying
Shares in connection with the valid exercise of any Subscription Rights; and
(iii) collection of (X) any monies due and owing to the Surviving Corporation on
account of the valid exercise of any Subscription Right and (Y) any documents as
may reasonably be required by the Subscription Rights Agent in order to evidence
the valid exercise of the Subscription Rights (including the Basic Subscription
Privilege and the Oversubscription Privilege) (such documents, the "SUBSCRIPTION
FORMS"); provided that holders of Company Common Shares as of the Effective Time
shall be required to submit monies due and Subscription Forms to the
Subscription Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Date. In order to facilitate
the exercise of the Subscription Rights, the Subscription Forms shall be
included in the Solicitation Documentation but shall not themselves represent
any right to Subscription Rights or any other security, value or any part of the
Merger Consideration. In furtherance of the foregoing and subject to the
agreement of the Company and Gotham, the Subscription Rights Agent shall make
Subscription Forms available upon request by any holder of Company Common Shares
(whether such holder held such share as of the Record Date (as defined below) or
thereafter) and shall institute such procedures as may reasonably be required by
the Subscription Rights Agent in order to allow any such holder to exercise his
or her Subscription Rights (including the Basic Subscription Privilege and the
Oversubscription Privilege) prior to the Expiration Date. Except as provided
otherwise in this Section 2.12, the Surviving Corporation, acting through and
with the assistance of the Subscription Rights Agent, shall cause Underlying
Shares purchased pursuant to the valid exercise of Sub-

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

scription Rights to be entered into the transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation in the name of each subscriber as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time but in no event later than the fifth business day
following the Closing Date.

            Subject to the consummation of all of the transactions contemplated
hereby, at a date determined by the Company's Board of Trustees in consultation
with GGC (such date, the "RECORD DATE"), with the acknowledgement and agreement
that the Record Date shall also be the record date for the Company Meeting, and
after the Registration Statement (as defined in Section 4.04) that is part of
the Proxy Statement-Prospectus (as defined in Section 4.04) is declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (such date, the
"REGISTRATION STATEMENT EFFECTIVE Date") and without any action on the part of
any holder of Company Common Shares, the following actions, undertakings and
events shall occur:

            (a) Basic Subscription Privilege. For every fifty (50) Company
       Common Shares that a holder of record holds as of the Effective Time, the
       Subscription Rights Agent shall distribute by way of book entry credit in
       the Company's transfer books for the account of such holder three (3)
       uncertificated Subscription Rights, with each Subscription Right
       exercisable to purchase one Underlying Share at $20.00 per share (the
       "SUBSCRIPTION PRICE") (with such Underlying Shares to be issued and
       distributed by way of book entry credit in the Surviving Corporation's
       transfer books for the account of by the Surviving Corporation through
       the Subscription Rights Agent, and with all proceeds on account of any
       exercise of Subscription Rights to go to the Surviving Corporation,
       subject to fees and expenses) (the "BASIC SUBSCRIPTION PRIVILEGE"). For
       purposes of clarity, it is agreed and understood that holders of Company
       Common Shares may exercise the Subscription Rights granted to such
       holders in connection herewith in whole or in part.

            (b) Expiration of Subscription Rights; Effect of Expiration. Each
       holder entitled to receive a Subscription Right as of the Effective Time
       shall have the right to submit to the Subscription Rights Agent a
       Subscription Form evidencing such holder's exercise of his or her
       Subscription Right, provided, however, that the Subscription Rights Agent
       receive such Subscription Form no later than one business day prior to
       the Effective Time (the "EXPIRATION DATE"). On or after the Expiration
       Date, the Subscription Rights Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall
       not be obligated to and shall not recognize the validity of any
       Subscription Form evidencing a holder's decision to exercise a
       Subscription Right, or otherwise honor any purported exercise of any
       Subscription Rights received by the Subscription Agent, regardless of
       when the Subscription Form relating to such exercise were sent. Notice of
       any extension of the Expiration Date shall be made through a joint press
       release issued by the Company and GGC.

            (c) No Fractional Subscription Rights. No fraction of Subscription
       Rights shall be issued as part of the Merger Consideration, but in lieu
       thereof each holder of Company Common Shares who would otherwise be
       entitled to a fraction of Subscription Rights shall receive a number of
       Subscription Rights rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (with
       fractions equal to or greater than 0.5 being rounded up).

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

            (d) Oversubscription Privilege. Subject to the allocation described
       below, each Subscription Right shall also carry the right (the
       "OVERSUBSCRIPTION PRIVILEGE") to subscribe for Underlying Shares at the
       Subscription Price, up to the aggregate number of Underlying Shares not
       subscribed through the Basic Subscription Privilege (such number, the
       "EXCESS SHARES"). If the Excess Shares are insufficient to satisfy all of
       the subscriptions pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege, the Excess
       Shares shall be allocated pro rata among those holders of Subscription
       Rights exercising such Oversubscription Privilege in proportion to the
       number of Underlying Shares that each such holder exercising the
       Oversubscription Privilege has requested pursuant to the Oversubscription
       Privilege; provided, however, that (i) no fractional Underlying Shares
       shall be allocated, but, in lieu thereof, each holder of Subscription
       Rights exercising the Oversubscription Privilege who otherwise would be
       entitled to a fraction of an Underlying Share shall receive a number of
       Underlying Shares rounded to the nearest whole number and (ii) if such
       pro rata allocation results in any Subscription Rights holder being
       allocated a greater number of Excess Shares than such holder subscribed
       for pursuant to the exercise of such holder's Oversubscription Privilege,
       then such additional Excess Shares shall be allocated pro rata among all
       other holders exercising the Oversubscription Privilege in proportion to
       the number of Underlying Shares that each such other holder exercising
       the Oversubscription Privilege has requested pursuant to the
       Oversubscription Privilege. All beneficial holders of Subscription Rights
       who exercise the Basic Subscription Privilege shall be entitled to
       exercise the Oversubscription Privilege. In respect of the
       Oversubscription Privilege, Underlying Shares shall be entered into the
       transfer books of the Surviving Corporation in the name of each
       subscriber as soon as practicable following the Closing Date and after
       all prorations have been effected. Funds received, if any, in payment of
       the Subscription Price for Excess Shares subscribed for pursuant to the
       Oversubscription Privilege prior to notification by the Subscription
       Agent of the allocation of Excess Shares shall be held in a segregated
       account pending issuance of the Excess Shares. If a Subscription Rights
       holder exercising the Oversubscription Privilege is allocated less than
       all of the Excess Shares to which such holder wished to subscribe
       pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege, the excess funds paid by such
       holder in respect of the Subscription Price for Excess Shares not issued
       shall be returned by mail without interest or deduction as soon as
       practicable after the Closing Date.

            (e) Additional Shares. Anything contained herein to the contrary
       notwithstanding, (i) in connection with the transactions contemplated
       hereby, GGC may in its sole discretion offer additional Underlying Shares
       to holders of Company Common Shares or third parties at the Subscription
       Price (the "OVER-ALLOTMENT RIGHT") (provided, however, that any
       Underlying Shares offered pursuant to the Over-allotment Right shall not
       exceed 15% of the total number of Underlying Shares available pursuant to
       the Basic Subscription Privilege) and (ii) subject to applicable law, GGC
       may at any time prior to or after the Effective Time issue, sell or offer
       to issue or sell debt or equity securities of itself to any persons or
       entity on terms and conditions of its own choosing, in its sole
       discretion.

            (f) Nominees. Banks, brokers and other nominee holders of
       Subscription Rights who exercise the Basic Subscription Privilege and the
       Oversubscription Privilege on behalf of beneficial owners of Subscription
       Rights shall be required to certify to the

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

       Subscription Rights Agent and the Surviving Corporation, in
       connection with the exercise of each of the Basic Subscription Privilege
       and the Oversubscription Privilege, as to the aggregate number of
       Subscription Rights that have been exercised and the number of Excess
       Shares that are being subscribed for pursuant to the Oversubscription
       Privilege by each beneficial owner of Subscription Rights on whose behalf
       such bank, broker or other nominee holder is acting.

            Section 2.13. The Notes. In connection with the payment of the
Merger Consideration (but in lieu of the Note Cash Amount), and subject to the
Adjustment Event provided in Section 7.02 and the consummation of all of the
transactions contemplated hereby, prior to the Registration Statement Effective
Date, the following actions, undertakings and events shall occur:

            (a) Designation of the Note Agent. GGC shall designate (pursuant to
       an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to GGC and the
       Company) the Paying Agent (or such other person or entity as GGC shall
       designate who is acceptable to the Company in its reasonable discretion)
       to act as agent for the distribution of Notes and collection of documents
       evidencing the right to a Note (the "NOTE AGENT").

            (b) Distribution of the Notes. Upon a Note Election by a holder of
       Company Common Shares and the execution of any documentation that the
       Note Agent shall reasonably require, for every 174.0296 shares of Company
       Common Shares that a holder of record possesses as of the Record Date,
       the Note Agent shall distribute by way of book entry credit in the
       Surviving Corporation's transfer books for the account of such electing
       holder one uncertificated Note, each with a face amount of $100 and with
       terms and conditions as set forth in EXHIBIT C (the "NOTE TERMS"). Except
       as provided otherwise in the Note Terms, the Surviving Corporation,
       acting through and with the assistance of the Note Agent, shall cause the
       Notes to be entered into the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
       in the name of the holder of record as soon as reasonably practicable
       after the Effective Time but in no event later than the fifth business
       day following the Closing Date.

            (c) No Fractional Notes. No fraction of a Note shall be issued as
       part of the Merger Consideration, but in lieu thereof, each holder who
       otherwise would be entitled to a fraction of a Note shall receive from
       the Note Agent, in lieu of such fraction of a Note, an amount of cash
       (rounded to the nearest whole cent and without interest) equal to (i)
       such fraction multiplied by (ii) $60.91. As soon as practicable after the
       determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
       Notes in lieu of any fractional Notes, the Note Agent shall make
       available such amounts to such holders as if it were the Merger
       Consideration. The foregoing notwithstanding, any holder who is entitled
       to receive cash as described in the first sentence of this Section
       2.13(c) may, instead of receiving such cash, elect to pay the Surviving
       Corporation sufficient amounts (with a price per Note equal to $60.91),
       so that such holder receives a full Note instead of an entitlement to a
       fraction of a Note (the "FRACTIONAL NOTE PURCHASE Right"). Notes shall be
       available for purchase pursuant to the Fractional Note Purchase Right
       only up to that number of Notes that the Cash Electors would have
       received had they elected to receive Notes in the Note Election (such
       number, the "DECLINED NOTES"). If and to the extent

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

       holders exercise the Fractional Note Purchase Right for Notes in an
       amount in excess of the Declined Notes, the Declined Notes shall be
       allocated among such holders in order of priority based on (X) the size
       of the fraction of a Note to which such holders otherwise would have been
       entitled to receive (with the largest fraction taking priority) and (Y)
       to the extent holders are entitled to the same fraction of a Note, the
       number of Notes to which such holders elected to receive in the Note
       Election (with the largest number taking priority). If any holder
       exercising the Fractional Note Purchase Right is allocated less than all
       of the Notes that such holder wished to purchase pursuant to the
       Fractional Note Purchase Right, the excess funds paid by such holder in
       respect of the Notes not issued shall be returned by mail without
       interest or deduction as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. Any
       such holders, in connection with receiving Notes pursuant to the
       Fractional Note Purchase Right, shall take priority over any holders
       exercising their Shareholder Note Purchase Rights (defined below).

            (d) Shareholder Note Purchase Right. Any holder of Company Common
       Shares shall have the right (the "SHAREHOLDER NOTE PURCHASE RIGHT") to
       purchase Notes, for a per Note purchase price of $60.91, up to that
       number of Notes (such number, the "REMAINING NOTES") equal to (i) the
       aggregate number of Declined Notes less (ii) the difference between (X)
       the number of Notes received by holders pursuant to the Fractional Note
       Purchase Right and (Y) the sum of all fractional Notes that holders
       entitled to exercise the Fractional Purchase Right would otherwise have
       been entitled to receive had such holders been entitled to received
       fractional Notes. If and to the extent such holders exercise the
       Shareholder Note Purchase Right for Notes in an amount in excess of the
       Remaining Notes, the number of Notes that such holders shall receive
       shall be allocated among all such holders pro rata based on the number of
       Notes that such holders requested to receive in connection with
       exercising the Shareholder Note Purchase Right; provided, however, that
       (i) no fractional Notes shall be allocated, but, in lieu thereof, each
       holder exercising the Shareholder Note Purchase Right who otherwise would
       be entitled to a fraction of a Note shall receive a number of Notes
       rounded down to the nearest whole number and (ii) if any holder
       exercising the Shareholder Note Purchase Right is allocated less than all
       of the Notes that such holder wished to purchase pursuant the Shareholder
       Note Purchase Right, the excess funds paid by such holder in respect of
       the Notes not issued shall be returned by mail without interest or
       deduction as soon as practicable after the Closing Date.

            (e) Gotham Note Purchase. Simultaneous with the Effective Time and
       subject to, and upon the terms and conditions of, this Agreement, Gotham
       shall transfer to GGC immediately available funds (the "GOTHAM NOTE
       PAYMENT") in an amount equal to (i) $60.91 multiplied by (ii) that number
       of Notes (such number, the "GOTHAM NOTES") equal to (X) the Remaining
       Notes less (Y) the Notes purchased through the Shareholder Note Purchase
       Right. In respect of the Gotham Note Payment and immediately upon receipt
       thereof, GGC shall issue to Gotham the Gotham Notes, which shall be
       deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable.

            (f) Nominees. Banks, brokers and other nominees that exercise the
       Note Election, Fractional Note Purchase Right or Shareholder Note
       Purchase Right on behalf of beneficial owners of Company Common Shares
       shall be required to certify to the Note


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

       Agent and the Surviving Corporation, in connection with the exercise
       of each of the Note Election, Fractional Note Purchase Right or
       Shareholder Note Purchase Right, as to the aggregate number of Notes to
       be received pursuant to the Note Election, Fractional Note Purchase Right
       or Shareholder Note Purchase Right by each beneficial owner of Company
       Common Shares on whose behalf such bank, broker or other nominee holder
       is acting.

            Section 2.14. The Escrow Fund. (a) On the Closing Date, for the
benefit of holders of Company Common Shares as of the Effective Time or for the
benefit of the Surviving Corporation (as the case may be), the Company shall
deposit in escrow (the "ESCROW FUND") an amount of cash sufficient to satisfy
the Reasonably Expected Liabilities (as defined below) (the "ESCROW AMOUNT")
with an escrow agent acceptable to the Company in its reasonable discretion
(pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to GGC and
the Company (the "ESCROW ARRANGEMENT")). The Escrow Amount shall be determined
exclusively with reference to that amount of cash equal to the expected value of
any claims, expenses, losses, liabilities, and obligations of the Company, the
FUMI Share Trust or their respective subsidiaries whether currently known or
unknown, absolute or contingent, asserted or unasserted, direct or indirect,
arising by operation of law, equity or otherwise that would reasonably be
expected to arise after the date hereof as a result of, on account of, in
connection with or related to any fact, circumstance, condition or event
occurring prior to the Closing Date that would amount to a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or in any agreement
attached as an Exhibit hereto made by or on behalf of the Company, the FUMI
Share Trust or their respective subsidiaries (as if such representations,
warranties and covenants were made as of the date hereof and at and as of the
Effective Time as though made at and as of such time (or, if made as of a
specific date, at and as of such date)) (such matters, "REASONABLY EXPECTED
LIABILITIES"; provided, however, that Reasonably Expected Liabilities shall not
include such liabilities listed on Section 2.14(a) of the Gotham Disclosure
Schedule).

            (b) The Escrow Amount, including any earnings or interest thereon,
shall be held and disbursed as provided in the Escrow Arrangement, which shall
provide, among other things, that (i) any fees or expenses on account of, in
connection with or related to the Escrow Arrangement shall be paid out of the
Escrow Fund; (ii) any Taxes on earnings of the Escrow Fund shall be paid out of
the Escrow Fund; (iii) funds shall be disbursed to the Surviving Corporation on
an as- and when-needed basis to satisfy the Reasonably Expected Liabilities in
the full amount of the actual liability relating to such Reasonably Expected
Liability; (iv) as of the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "ESCROW
DISTRIBUTION DATE"), an amount of cash equal to the funds remaining in the
Escrow Fund (including a ratable share of accrued interest on escrowed funds but
less any Taxes due on account thereof) (the "REMAINING ESCROW AMOUNT") less the
Escrow Distribution Costs (defined below) shall be distributed to holders of
Company Common Shares as of the Effective Time on a pro rata basis (such amount
per Company Common Share, the "ESCROW DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT"); (v) costs and
expenses arising from or related to the Escrow Distribution (the "ESCROW
DISTRIBUTION COSTS") shall be deducted from the Remaining Escrow Amount; and
(vi) the Escrow Fund shall avoid qualification (by way of exception, exemption
or otherwise) as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of
1940.

            (c) For purposes of this Section 2.14, the Escrow Amount shall be
determined after the Company's compliance with its covenants contained in
Section 7.15 and immediately

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

prior to or on the Closing Date, but in no event later than three (3) days after
the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than any conditions
relating to the Escrow Arrangement) by mutual agreement of Gotham and the
Company based on each of Gotham's and the Company's good-faith estimation of the
Reasonably Expected Liabilities. If, after good-faith negotiations, Gotham and
the Company cannot agree on the appropriate Escrow Amount, a single mutually
acceptable appraiser (the "ESCROW APPRAISER") shall be appointed by Gotham and
the Company to determine the appropriate Escrow Amount. In furtherance of the
Escrow Appraiser making its determination of the appropriate Escrow Amount, each
of Gotham and the Company shall submit a single dollar amount representing each
of their good-faith estimation of the aggregate amount of the Reasonably
Expected Liabilities (each a "PROPOSED DETERMINATION"). Concurrently therewith,
the Escrow Appraiser shall allow Gotham and the Company an oral hearing lasting
a total of three (3) hours (divided into equal one and a half (1.5) hour
increments for each of Gotham and the Company) and shall allow each of Gotham
and the Company to submit written arguments and supporting documentation as the
Escrow Appraiser shall determine are sufficient, in its reasonable discretion.
Promptly thereafter, but in no event later than five (5) days from the
submission of such written arguments and supporting documentation, the Escrow
Appraiser shall make its determination as to the appropriate Escrow Amount by
choosing either Gotham's or the Company's Proposed Determination. The
determination of the Escrow Appraiser shall be final, delivered orally, binding
on the parties in all respects and unappealable.

            (d) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, no
Escrow Arrangement shall be executed, no funds shall be deposited in the Escrow
Fund and no Escrow Share Holdback shall be deducted from any part of the Cash
Amount unless the Reasonably Expected Liabilities shall amount, in the
aggregate, to a sum of cash greater than or equal to $350,000. For purposes of
clarity, it is acknowledged and agreed that (i) such $350,000 is merely a
threshold after which the Escrow Fund must be established, (ii) in no event
shall such $350,000 be deemed to be a deductible from the Escrow Amount and
(iii) in the event that the Escrow Fund is established, any matter funded

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GGP, GGC AND SUB

            Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule dated as of the date

existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and each having the requisite
partnership or corporate power and authority, as the case may be, to own, lease

conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a GGP Material Adverse Effect. Concurrently with
the Contribution, the partners of GGP have agreed to amend and restate in full
GGP's current Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the
"CURRENT GGP AGREEMENT") in the form attached as EXHIBIT D, to be effective

EFFECT" shall mean any change or event or effect that is, or is reasonably
expected to be, materially adverse to the value of the transactions contemplated
hereby to the Company and holders of Company Common Shares, in each case taken

            (b) As of the date hereof, the authorized equity of GGC consists of
1000 shares of common stock. As of the date hereof, 1000 shares of GGC common
stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the date hereof,
(i) GGP owns all of the outstanding shares of GGC common stock and (ii) GGC owns
all of the Sub Shares. As of the Effective Time, GGC shall own all of the
outstanding equity interests in Golf LLC. No shares of GGC common stock were

stock, Note and Mirror Series A Preferred Share issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall, when issued in accordance with their
respective terms, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, with the rights set forth in the Restated GGC Agreements, the
Note Terms or the Mirror Series A Certificate of Designations, each as
applicable.

options, calls, contracts, commitments, understandings, restrictions,
arrangements, rights or warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange

deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
GGC common stock or obligating GGC to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreement or commitment.

            (d) There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
GGC having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of shares
of GGC common stock may vote. Other than this Agreement and the Equityholders
Agreement (the form of which is attached as EXHIBIT G) (the "EQUITYHOLDERS
AGREEMENT"), there are no voting trusts, irrevocable proxies or other agreements
or understandings to which GGC or GGP is a party or is bound with respect to the
voting of any shares of GGP equity interests.

            Section 5.03. Interim Operations of GGC and Sub. Each of GGC and Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby, and, except as provided in Section 5.03 of the GGP Disclosure Schedule,
each has engaged in no business and has incurred no liabilities other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Schedule sets forth each direct and indirect subsidiary of GGP (each a "GGP
SUBSIDIARY"), and each GGP subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and,

its business as it is now being conducted and each GGP Subsidiary is qualified
to transact business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business

not reasonably be expected to have a GGP Material Adverse Effect. All of the
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of each GGP Subsidiary are
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and,
except as otherwise provided in Section 5.04 of the GGP Disclosure Schedule, are
owned directly or indirectly by GGP. There are no subscriptions, options,
warrants, voting trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings,
restrictions or arrangements to which GGP or any GGP Subsidiaries is a party
relating to the issuance, sale, voting or transfer of any capital stock or other
equity interests of any GGP Subsidiary, including any right of conversion or
exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or agreement. Except as set
forth in Section 5.04 of the GGP Disclosure Schedule, GGP has no material

Board of Directors and shareholders of each of GGC and Sub, and no other
partnership or corporate proceedings, as the case may be, on the part of GGP,

contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by GGP,
GGC and Sub, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof
by the parties hereto other than GGP, GGC and Sub, constitutes a valid and
legally binding agreement of GGP, GGC and Sub, enforceable against GGP, GGC and
Sub in accordance with its terms.

            (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
GGP, GGC and Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not and shall not violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision
of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or require any offer to purchase or any prepayment of any
debt or result in the creation of any lien, security interest or encumbrance
upon any of the properties or assets of GGC, Sub, GGP or any GGP Subsidiaries
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) the Current GGP
Agreement and related constitutive documents of GGP or certificates of

                                   ARTICLE VI

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY,
                          THE FUMI SHARE TRUST AND FUMI

            Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed on or prior to
the date hereof, or in the disclosure schedule dated as of the date hereof
delivered by the Company to Gotham, GGC and GGP (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE"), the Company, the FUMI Share Trust and FUMI hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to Gotham, GGC and GGP as

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

follows; provided, however, that the parties hereto have agreed that the
representations and warranties in this Article VI and the information in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, other than as set forth in Section 6.05 and as
specifically provided in Section 6.06 with respect to VenTek International,
Inc. ("VENTEK"), shall not encompass or include any information with respect to
(i) the operations of VenTek or (ii) tenant leases at the Park Plaza Mall
property and Circle Tower (as defined below); and provided further that, to the
extent the representations and warranties set forth in this Article VI relate
to the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise to entities other than the FUMI
Share Trust, FUMI and FUMI's subsidiaries, the representations and warranties
of the FUMI Share Trust and FUMI are based solely upon, limited by, and subject
to the knowledge of the FUMI Share Trust and FUMI:

            Section 6.01. Organization and Qualification. The Company is a
business trust, the FUMI Share Trust is a trust and FUMI is a corporation, each
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the state of its
formation and each having the requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties and to carry on its respective businesses as
they are now being conducted or as contemplated herein. Each of the Company,
the FUMI Share Trust and FUMI is qualified to transact business and, where
applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification necessary, except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. True, accurate and complete copies
of the Company's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Bylaws, the FUMI
Share Trust's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and FUMI's Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws, and, in each case, any other constitutive
documents, in each case as amended and in effect on the date hereof, including
all amendments thereto, have heretofore been filed with the SEC or delivered to
Gotham or its representatives.

            For purposes of this Agreement, the term "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT" shall mean any change or event or effect that is, or could reasonably be
expected to be, materially adverse to the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company, the FUMI Share
Trust, FUMI and their respective subsidiaries taken as a whole (except for any
such change, event or effect resulting from or arising out of (i) the
announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii)
economic events generally related to the U.S. economy or securities markets
generally). The parties agree that the commencement of construction of a mall or
similar shopping facility in a location that competes with the Park Plaza Mall
shall not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The foregoing
notwithstanding, any matter that would constitute a breach by Gotham of Section
4.06 shall not be considered for the purpose of determining whether any change
or event or effect gives rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            Section 6.02. Capitalization. (a) The authorized equity of the
Company consists of unlimited Company Common Shares and 2,300,000 Company
Preferred Shares. The only beneficiaries of the FUMI Share Trust are the

respective subsidiaries is a party or is bound with respect to the voting of any

            (e) The Company has filed with the SEC or previously made available
to Gotham complete and correct copies of the Stock Incentive Plan and the 1999

immediately after the Effective Time.

            Section 6.03. Subsidiaries. Section 6.03 of the Company Disclosure

where applicable, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and each such subsidiary is qualified to transact business, and is in

            Section 7.02. Certain Adjustment of Consideration. Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the
Registration Statement Effective Date, if (i) any required consents, approvals
or similar clearances with respect to the Notes (collectively, the "NOTE
CONSENTS") cannot be obtained by the Company and/or Gotham or GGC (directly or
by and on behalf of each of their respective affiliates) or (ii) the issuance of
Notes in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby other than the
issuance of Notes, then, in each case the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
to eliminate the Note Election (and any other provisions hereof relating to
Notes shall be completely ineffective) (such election, the "ADJUSTMENT EVENT").
In the event of an Adjustment Event, and subject to Section 7.02, (i) the Cash
Amount shall be adjusted to an amount equal to $2.55 less the Aggregate
Holdback; (ii) the Gotham Note Payment and Post-Closing Note Redemption shall no
longer be required; and (iii) any and all undertakings, terms or conditions
contemplated by the Note Terms shall no longer be required or effective.

            Section 7.03. Preparation of Solicitation Documentation and Proxy
Statement-Prospectus; Company Meeting. (a) In connection with the Company
Meeting and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company (and to the extent
required by applicable law, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
the other parties) shall (i) promptly prepare and file with the SEC, use its
best efforts to have cleared by the SEC, and thereafter mail to its shareholders
as promptly as practicable (X) the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and (Y) to the
extent required, the Solicitation Documentation, and, in each case, any
amendments or supplements thereto and all other proxy materials for such
meeting, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts (including postponing or
adjourning the Company Meeting to solicit additional proxies) to obtain the
necessary approvals by holders of Company Common Shares for the FUR Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) otherwise comply
with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting and the Solicitation
Documentation. The Company (and to the extent applicable, the other parties)
shall provide the other parties and their respective legal counsel and financial
advisors with sufficient opportunity to review the form and substance of the
Solicitation Documentation (including any amendments or supplements thereto)
prior to filing such with the SEC. The Company (and to the extent applicable,
the other parties) shall provide to the other parties copies of any comments and
descriptions of any oral communications received from the SEC in connection
therewith. Subject to Section 7.03(b), the Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall
contain the unqualified recommendation of the Board of Trustees of the Company
that the holders of Company Common Shares vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of the FUR Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

            (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date the
Registration Statement of which the Proxy Statement-Prospectus forms a part is
declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
Company Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval.
Each of the parties shall use its respective reasonable efforts to take such
steps as are necessary to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting within 150 days
of the date of this Agreement. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to the first two sentences of this Section 7.03(b) shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (de-

                                      -47-

fined below). Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, it is
understood by the parties that, except as otherwise required by applicable law,
the Company Board of Trustees shall not be required to give a recommendation as
to the election with respect to the Note Election or the exercise of
Subscription Rights.

            Section 7.04. No Solicitation. (a) After the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, other than with
respect to Gotham, the Company and the FUMI Share Trust shall not, and the
Company and the FUMI Share Trust shall not knowingly permit any trustee,
director, officer, agent or employee of the Company, the FUMI Share Trust, or
any attorney, accountant, investment banker, financial advisor or other agent
retained by the Company, the FUMI Share Trust or any of their respective
subsidiaries, to (i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiry, proposal or
offer to acquire any interest in, dispose of or otherwise result in a change of
control of the Company or any of its assets (including all or substantially all
of the business, properties, assets or beneficial interest of the Company),
whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise, whether for
cash, securities or any other consideration or combination thereof (any such
transactions being referred to herein as an "ACQUISITION TRANSACTION"), (ii)
engage in negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Transaction,
(iii) provide nonpublic or confidential information to facilitate an Acquisition
Transaction or (iv) agree to recommend any unsolicited bona fide written offer
or proposal with respect to a potential or proposed Acquisition Transaction (an
"ACQUISITION PROPOSAL").

            (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) above or any other provision of
this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
FUMI Share Trust and FUMI may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal from a
corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (a "POTENTIAL
ACQUIROR") that the Company's Board of Trustees determines, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and legal counsel, could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, furnish confidential or nonpublic
information to, and engage in discussions and negotiate with, such Potential
Acquiror. For purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal made by a Potential Acquiror (i) to acquire, for
consideration consisting of cash or publicly traded securities, more than 90% of
the Company Common Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company, the FUMI Share Trust and their respective subsidiaries and (ii) that
the Company's Board of Trustees determines, in good faith and after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and legal counsel, would be more
favorable to the holders of the Company Common Shares than the Mergers, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and for which financing, to
the extent required, is then committed or that, in the good faith judgment of
the Company's Board of Trustees, is reasonably capable of being obtained.

            (c) The Company shall promptly notify Gotham after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal (and in any event prior to any determination of the
Company's Board of Trustees in respect of any such Acquisition Proposal). Such
notice to Gotham shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the
Potential Acquiror and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, to the extent known.

            (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.04 or any other provision of
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Company's Board of Trustees, the
FUMI Share Trust, FUMI or FUMI's Board of Directors (or any trustee, director,
officer, agent or employee

                                       -48
<PAGE>

of the foregoing) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to
Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making such
disclosure to the Company's shareholders as, in the good faith judgment of the
Company's Board of Trustees, the Trustee of the FUMI Share Trust or FUMI's Board
of Directors, as the case may be, in each case after consultation with outside
counsel, is required under applicable law.

            Section 7.05. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except for
competitively sensitive information as to which access, use and treatment is
subject to applicable law, the Company, the FUMI Share Trust and their
respective subsidiaries shall afford to the other parties and their respective
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice throughout the period
from the date hereof through the Effective Time to their respective properties,
books, Contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, shall furnish
promptly such information concerning their businesses, properties and personnel
as such parties shall reasonably request (including for purposes of determining
the Escrow Amount); provided, however, that such investigation shall not
unreasonably disrupt the Company's, the FUMI Share Trust's or their respective
subsidiaries' operations. All nonpublic information provided to, or obtained by,
Gotham or its Representative (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be "Confidential
Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement dated August 9, 2001
between Gotham and the Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of
which shall continue in force until the Effective Time; provided that Gotham,
GGC and the Company may disclose such information as may be necessary in
connection with seeking the GGP Required Approvals, the Company Required
Approvals and the Company Shareholder Approval. The foregoing notwithstanding,
the Company, the FUMI Share Trust and their respective subsidiaries shall not be
required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not
provide to the other parties by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations,
which constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which
the Company, the FUMI Share Trust or any of their respective subsidiaries is
required to keep confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding
with third parties; provided, however, that in the event the Company, the FUMI
Share Trust or their respective subsidiaries do not provide such information,
each shall provide, in writing, to the party requesting such information, the
reason or reasons for its refusal to provide such information.

            (b) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall promptly advise
Gotham, GGC and GGP orally and in writing of any change, circumstance or event
that, individually or in the aggregate, has caused or could reasonably be
expected to cause any of the representations and warranties of the Company and
the FUMI Share Trust on behalf of themselves and their respective subsidiaries
contained in this Agreement not to be true and correct in all material respects
at or as of the Effective Time, as though made at and as of such time (or, if
made as of a specific date, at and as of such date).

            Section 7.06. Post-Closing Note Redemption. Subject to applicable
law, and as set forth more fully in the Note Terms in EXHIBIT C, any Notes
issued to any former holder of Company Common Shares who exercised his or her
Note Election to receive Notes as part of such holder's Merger Consideration
(but excluding the Notes issued to any holder in connection with such holder's
exercise of his or her Shareholder Note Purchase Right) shall automatically be

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

redeemed by the issuer of the Notes (the "POST-CLOSING NOTE REDEMPTION") ninety
(90) days from and after the Closing Date (the "REDEMPTION TIME"), at a price
equal to $60.91 per Note, without interest, unless prior to the Redemption Time,
such former holder affirmatively elects to retain ownership of his or her Notes
(such redeemed Notes, the "REDEEMED NOTES"). Immediately after the redemption of
any Redeemed Notes, Gotham shall purchase from the issuer of the Notes, and the
issuer of the Notes shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Gotham,
such Redeemed Notes at a price equal to $60.91 per Note, which shall be deemed
to be fully paid and nonassessable.

            Section 7.07. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the
parties shall take all steps as may be required and permitted to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
Company Common Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Shares) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            Section 7.08. Public Announcements. Other than with respect to any
public announcement made by the Company in connection with Section 7.04, the
parties shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and make reasonable comment upon, any press release or
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with the NYSE, shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation; provided, however, that
each of Gotham and the Company may issue a press release or make any public
statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so
long as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by the parties; provided further
that, subject to applicable law, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, Gotham, GGP, and their respective legal and financial
advisors shall be permitted to engage in "road show" or similar and related
activities in respect of the Subscription Rights or any equity offering in
respect of the Surviving Corporation, without prior approval or review on the
part of the Company.

            Section 7.09. Expenses and Fees. Except as otherwise provided herein
(including in the following two sentences), all fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs and expenses,
including fees for accountants, lawyers, financial advisors, contractors and
consultants. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall promptly reimburse
Gotham and its affiliates and GGP and its affiliates for their reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including fees for accountants, lawyers,
financial advisors, contractors and consultants) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 9.01(b)(ii), 9.01(c) (other than
with respect to any matter described in Section 7.09 of the Gotham Disclosure
Schedule), 9.01(d) or 9.01(e). Furthermore, notwithstanding the first sentence
of this Section 7.09, in the event that the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the transaction costs related to the
Mergers, the Contribution, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation, and accordingly the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly reimburse the parties and their affiliates
for their respective reasonable expenses in-

                                      -50-

curred in connection with the Mergers, the Contribution, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including fees for accountants, counsel,
investment bankers, and financial advisors and consultants.

            Section 7.10. Agreement to Cooperate. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and applicable law, each of the parties hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to obtain all necessary
or appropriate waivers, consents or approvals of third parties required in order
to preserve material contractual relationships of Gotham, GGP, the Company, the
FUMI Share Trust and their respective subsidiaries (including any amendment,
supplement or change of such material contractual relationships reasonably
necessary to effect the Mergers, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby), all necessary or appropriate waivers, consents, permits
and approvals to effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions and
to lift any injunction or other legal bar to consummation of the Mergers (and,
in such case, to proceed with the consummation of the Mergers as expeditiously
as possible), including through all possible appeals; provided, however,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except as set forth in
Section 7.10(a)(1) of the Gotham Disclosure Schedule (such matters set forth
therein, the "SHARED COSTS"), nothing herein shall require Gotham, Sub, GGC or
GGP or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to make any
out-of-pocket expenses, accrue any liability for its account or make any
accommodation or concession to the Company, the FUMI Share Trust, FUMI or any
third party (including Governmental Authorities) in connection with this Section
7.10. Except as set forth in Section 7.10(a)(2) of the Gotham Disclosure
Schedule (such matters set forth therein, the "DUE AUTHORIZATIONS") or as
otherwise provided in Article VIII hereof, there are no waivers, consents,
permits and approvals that are conditions to consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

            (b) In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto, to the extent applicable, undertakes and agrees to file (and
each party agrees to cause any person or entity that may be deemed to be the
ultimate parent entity or otherwise to file, if such filing is required by
applicable law) as soon as practicable, any form or report required by any other
governmental agency relating to antitrust matters. Each of the parties hereto,
to the extent applicable, shall (and, in each case, shall cause any such parent
entity to) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests
received from any federal, state, local or other governmental authority or
regulatory agency, commission, department or other governmental subdivision,
court, tribunal or body (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY") for additional
information or documentation. Each of the parties hereto shall take all
reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so as to enable the Effective
Time to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Each party shall (i) promptly
notify the other party of any written communication to that party or its
affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable law,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate, or to permit its
affiliates to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Mergers unless it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory authority or
members of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Mergers.

            Section 7.11. Trustees' and Officers' Indemnification. (a) Provided
that any funds available pursuant to that certain Escrow Agreement, dated as of
May 22, 1998, by the Company, FUMI and National City Bank (the "ESCROW

agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party.

            Section 10.10. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this

the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity.

admission by the parties in any Action or proceeding by or on behalf of a third
party, that such third party is not in breach or violation of, or in default in,
the performance or observance of any term or provision of any contract,
agreement or understanding.
