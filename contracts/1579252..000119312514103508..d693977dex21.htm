Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Seller Expenses, Rollover Amount and Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment). If Seller
delivers a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Parent within such 30-day period, Parent and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all disputes set forth therein during the 30-day period commencing on the date Parent receives the
applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Seller and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state law or rule.
If Seller and Parent do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to such disputed items within such 30-day period, then Seller and Parent shall engage, and the remaining items then in dispute shall be submitted immediately to, a nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and Seller. If Parent and Seller are unable to agree on the choice of such accounting firm within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after the expiration of the aforementioned 30-day period, then
Parent and Seller shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm by lot (after excluding their respective regularly used accounting firms). The accounting firm so agreed to or selected (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;) shall be required
to render a determination of the applicable disputes within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. Parent and
Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to, and the Accounting Firm shall not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Parent and Seller shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm shall, make its determination based solely on presentations by
Parent and Seller that are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (<I>i.e.</I>, not on the basis of an independent review). The terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon
between Seller and Parent, and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Parent; <U>provided</U> that such fees shall ultimately be borne by Parent, if the Accounting Firm resolves the disputed items in favor
of the aggregate amount for all such items set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice (the &#147;<U>Seller Proposed Amount</U>&#148;), and by Seller, if the Accounting Firm resolves the disputed items in favor of the aggregate amount for all
such items set forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (the &#147;<U>Parent Proposed Amount</U>&#148;). In resolving the disputed items, the Accounting Firm shall (i)&nbsp;limit its review to determining whether, considering all such
disputed items, the Parent Proposed Amount or the Seller Proposed Amount is more consistent with the related definitions of Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Seller Expenses and Purchase Price set
forth in this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;resolve all such disputed items by choosing such aggregate amount (i.e., the Seller Proposed Amount or the Parent Proposed Amount) that it determines to be more consistent with such definitions. Absent manifest
error, such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment). The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be revised, if
necessary, as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.4(b)(ii)</U> and, as so revised, such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working Capital,
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Seller Expenses, Rollover Amount and Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment). </P>

shall be a holder thereof, (ii)&nbsp;to the extent that files of Kirkland&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Ellis&nbsp;LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such

Parties hereby agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of any of the term or provision of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the
performance by any other party under this Agreement, and each Party hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of
injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive (a)&nbsp;any claim that the Party seeking such relief has an adequate remedy at law and (b)&nbsp;any requirement to post any bond, in each case, in connection with obtaining
such relief. The equitable remedies described in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U> shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the Parties may elect to pursue. Subject to the foregoing, each of the Parties
hereto agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other parties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and the Company will not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or specific performance to enforce the obligations of Parent or Buyer to effect the Closing pursuant
