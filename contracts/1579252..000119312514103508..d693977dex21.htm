on a date to be specified by the Parties, which shall be no later than the
second Business Day after satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE 7_ (other than those conditions which are to be satisfied by
the delivery of documents or taking of any other action at the Closing by any
Party, but subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of such conditions at the
Closing) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller. For purposes of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Closing shall be deemed to occur
as of the open of business on the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.3. _Deliveries at the Closing_.

 

(a) _Deliveries by Seller_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
certificate(s) representing the Purchased Shares, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by stock powers or any other proper instrument of assignment
endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer.

(b)  _Deliveries by Buyer_. At the Closing, Buyer shall (and Parent shall
cause Buyer to) pay the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with the
provisions set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_.

 

(c) _Other Deliveries_. At the Closing, each Party shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) all of the certificates, instruments and other documents
required to be delivered by such Party pursuant to _ARTICLE 7_ with respect to
the Closing.

Section 2.4.  _Purchase Price_.

(a) _Estimated Purchase Price_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing, Seller shall (or shall cause the Company to) deliver to Parent a
good faith calculation of the Purchase Price based upon (i) the Enterprise
Value and the unpaid portion of the Seller Insurance Payment and (ii) Sellers
good faith estimate of (A) the Net Working Capital Adjustment (which may be a
negative number), (B) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, (C) the amount
of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, (D) the amount of Seller Expenses and (E)
the Rollover Amount (such calculation of the Purchase Price, the " _Estimated
Purchase Price_ "), which shall include supporting documentation. The Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to come to an agreement as to the
calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price prior to the Closing; _provided_
, if Buyer and Seller are unable to come to such an agreement prior to the
Closing, (x) if the difference between the Buyers proposed Net Working
Capital Adjustment and the Sellers proposed Net Working Capital Adjustment
is less than or equal to $1,000,000, then the Buyers proposed Net Working
Capital Adjustment figure shall be used for the purposes

 



17  of calculating the Estimated Purchase Price, or (y) if such difference is
greater than $1,000,000, then the Net Working Capital Adjustment figure used
for the purposes of calculating the Estimated Purchase Price shall be zero
(0). At the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Estimated Purchase
Price as follows:

 

(i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be deposited into the applicable escrow
account established pursuant to (and the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of) an escrow agreement
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which Escrow Agreement shall be (A) entered into
as of the Closing by and among Seller, Parent and the Escrow Agent and (B)
substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto;

(ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be deposited into the applicable
escrow account established pursuant to (and the Indemnification Escrow Amount
shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of) Escrow
Agreement; and

 

(iii) to Seller, an amount equal to (A) the Estimated Purchase Price, _minus_
(B) the Adjusted Escrow Amount, _minus_  (C) the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, to an account specified by Seller at least one (1) day prior to
Closing.

(b)  _Determination of Final Purchase Price_.

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than seventy-five (75) days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare (and deliver to Seller) Parents good
faith proposed calculation of the Purchase Price, together with Parents good
faith proposed calculations of the Net Working Capital Adjustment and the
amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness,
Seller Expenses and Rollover Amount, in each case, including the components
thereof and in a manner consistent with the definitions thereof (which
calculations shall collectively be referred to herein from time to time as
the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, if Parent fails to timely deliver the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations, then, at the election of Seller in its sole
discretion, either: (A) the Actual Adjustment shall be deemed to equal zero;
or (B) Seller shall retain a nationally recognized independent accounting firm
to provide an audit of the Group Companies books, review the calculation of
the Estimated Purchase Price and make any adjustments necessary thereto
consistent with the provisions of this _Section 2.4(b)_, the determination of
such accounting firm being conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall
not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable; _provided_ , _however_
, that Seller reserves any and all rights granted to it in this Agreement. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause each other
Group Company to, make its financial records available to such accounting firm
in connection with its services and all fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be paid (or caused to be paid) by Parent.

 

(ii) If Seller does not give written notice of any dispute (a " _Purchase
Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within thirty (30) days of timely
receiving the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Parties each agree that
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final
Net Working Capital Adjustment, Cash and Cash Equivalents, 

 



18  Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Seller Expenses, Rollover Amount and
Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder (including the
determination of the Actual Adjustment). If Seller delivers a Purchase Price
Dispute Notice to Parent within such 30-day period, Parent and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all disputes set forth therein
during the 30-day period commencing on the date Parent receives
the applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Seller and all such
discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and
Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state law or rule. If Seller and Parent do not agree upon
a final resolution with respect to such disputed items within such 30-day
period, then Seller and Parent shall engage, and the remaining items then in
dispute shall be submitted immediately to, a nationally recognized accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Parent and Seller. If Parent and Seller are unable
to agree on the choice of such accounting firm within ten (10) Business Days
after the expiration of the aforementioned 30-day period, then Parent and
Seller shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm by lot (after
excluding their respective regularly used accounting firms). The accounting
firm so agreed to or selected (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall be
required to render a determination of the applicable disputes within thirty
(30) days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which
determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis therefor. Parent and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to,
and the Accounting Firm shall not, assign a value to any item in dispute
greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one
hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Parent
and Seller shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm
shall, make its determination based solely on presentations by Parent and
Seller that are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in
this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The
terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed
upon between Seller and Parent, and any associated engagement fees shall
initially be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Parent; _provided_ that such fees
shall ultimately be borne by Parent, if the Accounting Firm resolves the
disputed items in favor of the aggregate amount for all such items set forth
in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice (the " _Seller Proposed Amount_ "), and
by Seller, if the Accounting Firm resolves the disputed items in favor of the
aggregate amount for all such items set forth in the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations (the " _Parent Proposed Amount_ "). In resolving the disputed
items, the Accounting Firm shall (i) limit its review to determining whether,
considering all such disputed items, the Parent Proposed Amount or the Seller
Proposed Amount is more consistent with the related definitions of Net Working
Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Seller
Expenses and Purchase Price set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) resolve all
such disputed items by choosing such aggregate amount (i.e., the Seller
Proposed Amount or the Parent Proposed Amount) that it determines to be more
consistent with such definitions. Absent manifest error, such determination
of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for
all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).
The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be revised, if necessary, as
appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_ and, as so revised, such Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working Capital, Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Seller Expenses,
Rollover Amount and Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder
(including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

 



19 (iii) Each Group Company shall, and the Parent shall cause each Group Company
to, (A) make its accounting books, financial records and personnel available
to Seller, its accountants and other representatives and the Accounting Firm
at reasonable times during the review by Seller and/or the Accounting Firm of,
and the resolution of any disputes arising in connection with, the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations or any Purchase Price Dispute Notice and (B) not
take any action with respect to the accounting books, records, policies and
procedures of the Group Companies that would obstruct or prevent the
preparation of, or the resolution of disputes arising in connection with, the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations or any Purchase Price Dispute Notice as
provided in this _Section 2.4(b)_. Parent shall, and shall cause each Group
Company to, cooperate in the review of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations
and any Purchase Price Dispute Notice, including by providing customary
certifications to Seller or, if requested, to Sellers auditors or
the Accounting Firm.

(c) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then (A) Parent and Buyer
shall pay (or shall cause to be paid) to Seller an amount in cash equal to
such positive amount ( _plus_ interest thereon at a rate of 5.00% per annum
(the " _Agreed Rate_ ") from the Closing Date through the date of such
payment) and (B) all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released
to Seller. Parent and Seller shall take all actions required to cause the
Escrow Agent to make all disbursements, and Parent shall make (or cause to be
made) all payments, required pursuant to this  _Section 2.4(c)(i)_, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (to the account(s) designated by
Seller) within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to  _Section 2.4(b)_.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent shall be
entitled to receive a cash disbursement from the Adjustment Escrow Amount
equal to the absolute value of such negative amount ( _plus_ interest thereon
at the Agreed Rate from the Closing Date through the date of such
disbursement); _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that the Adjustment
Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay Parent the full value of such negative
amount, the Indemnifying Parties shall pay Parent any amount owed in excess of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, after all disbursements required to be made to Parent (or its
designee) pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_ have been made by the Escrow
Agent, if any funds remain in the Adjustment Escrow Account, such remaining
funds shall be disbursed to Seller (or its designee). The Parties shall take
all actions required to cause the Escrow Agent to make all disbursements
required pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (to the applicable accounts designated by Parent
and Seller, as applicable) within three (3) Business Days after the date on
which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_.

 

Section 2.5. _Payment of Funded Indebtedness and Seller Expenses_. On the
Closing Date, contemporaneously with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and on behalf of the Group Companies and
Seller, Parent and Buyer shall pay, or shall cause the Group Companies to pay,
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Closing Date
Funded Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ and the Seller Expenses to
such Persons entitled thereto, in each case, in the amounts set forth on the
calculation of Estimated Purchase Price delivered hereunder and pursuant
to wire instructions provided by Seller at least

 



20  one (1) day prior to the Closing. On or prior to the Closing, the Company
shall obtain customary payoff letters with respect to each debt facility,
instrument or Lien set forth on  _Schedule 2.5_ being repaid or terminated
(as applicable) in connection with the payment of Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents

contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement

which the Company will be a party will be when delivered at the Closing) duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes (and, with respect to
each of the Ancillary Documents to which the Company will be a party, will
constitute) a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company (assuming
that this Agreement

 



22  has been, and the Ancillary Documents to which the Company is a party will
be, duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the other Persons
party thereto), enforceable against the Company in accordance with their
respective terms, except (a) to the extent that enforceability may be limited

indicated in the notes thereto and except, in the case of unaudited Financial
Statements, for the absence of footnotes and subject to customary year-end

Statements, no Group Company has any liabilities of any nature that would be
required under GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies (including
the notes thereto), except liabilities that (i) were incurred since the date

the DGCL and federal or state securities or "blue sky" laws, and (d) those

Group Companys or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Non-Controlled
Joint Ventures Governing Documents, (x) result in a violation or breach of,

the knowledge of the Company, the other parties thereto are in material breach

of the Company, no Non-Controlled Joint Venture is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree that, in either case, would, if finally
determined pursuant to a final nonappealable judgment, have an adverse effect
which is material to the Group Companies and the Non-Controlled Joint

(collectively, the " _Group Company IP Rights_ ").  _Schedule 3.12(a)_ sets
forth a list of patents, patent applications, material unregistered
trademarks, trademark registrations, trademark applications and copyright
registrations owned by any Group Company. To the Companys knowledge, all of
the Group Company IP Rights listed on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ , and the

any Group Company. Further, (i) to the Companys knowledge, the conduct of the
business of the Group Companies and the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures as
currently conducted have not, does not and will not infringe, violate or
misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, and, in

which is material to their businesses, including maintaining the
confidentiality of their confidential or proprietary information. Subject to
any necessary notices and consents, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, will not result in the forfeiture, cancellation, termination or
other material impairment of, or give rise to any right of any Person to
cancel, terminate or otherwise impair the right of the Group Companies to own
or use or otherwise exercise any other rights that the Group Companies
currently have with respect to any material Intellectual Property.
Substantially all current salaried employees of the Group Companies have

the Group Companies and Non-Controlled Joint Ventures respective businesses
as they are currently conducted. In the last twelve (12) months, there has not

that has not been remedied in all material respects. The Group Companies and,
to the knowledge of the Company, the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures have in
place commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality,
integrity and security of the Group Company Systems (and all information and
transactions stored or contained therein) against any unauthorized use, access
or corruption. The Group Companies and, to the knowledge of the Company, the
Non-Controlled Joint Ventures have implemented commercially reasonable data
backup, data storage, system redundancy and disaster avoidance and recovery

limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and, in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Seller has the requisite
limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its

where the failure to have such power or authority would prevent or materially
delay Sellers performance of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 4.2. _Authority_. Seller has the requisite limited liability company
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Documents to which Seller is a party and to consummate the

limited liability company action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has
been (and each of the Ancillary Documents to which Seller will be a party
will be when delivered at the Closing) duly executed and delivered by Seller

Agreement has been, and the Ancillary Documents to which the Seller is a party
will be, duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
Persons thereto), enforceable against Seller in accordance with their terms,
except (a) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable

filings under, and applicable consents, waivers, authorizations,
and clearances obtained under, the HSR Act and all other applicable
antitrust, competition or similar law, rules, regulations, orders or decrees
(including applicable terminations, suspensions, authorizations, orders,

thereunder), (b) those the failure of which to obtain or make would not have a
material adverse effect on Sellers ownership of the Common Shares or

materially delay the Closing

 

Section 4.4. _Title to the Common Shares; Ownership of Seller_. As of the date
hereof, Seller owns of record and beneficially all of the Common Shares and

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND BUYER

 

Parent and Buyer hereby represent and warrant to Seller and the Company as
follows:

 

Section 5.1. _Organization_. Such Party is a company limited by shares or
limited liability company (as applicable), duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and
has all requisite power and authority to carry on its businesses as now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Ancillary
Documents to which such Party is a party. Such Party has delivered to Seller
true, correct and complete copies of its Governing Documents in effect as of
the date of this Agreement. Such Party is not in default under or in violation
of any provision of such Group Companys Governing Documents.

 

Section 5.2. _Authority_. Such Party has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which such
Party is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery of

 



37  this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which such Party is a party
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Party and no
other proceeding (including by its equityholders) on the part of such Party is
necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which
such Party is a party or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
No vote of such Partys equityholders is required to approve this Agreement or
for Parent and/or Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been (and the Ancillary Documents to which such Party is a
party will be when executed and delivered by such Party at the Closing) duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Party and constitutes (and, with
respect to each of the Ancillary Documents to which such Party will be a
party, will constitute) a valid, legal and binding agreement of such Party
(assuming this Agreement has been and the Ancillary Documents to which such
Party is a party will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
parties thereto), enforceable against such Party in accordance with their
respective terms, except (a) to the extent that enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (b) that the
availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be
brought.

 

Section 5.3. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Assuming the truth and
accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties contained in
_Section 3.5_ and Sellers representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.3_, no material notice to, filing with, or authorization, consent
or approval of any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which
such Party will be a party or the consummation by such Party of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (a) compliance with
filings under, and applicable consents, waivers, authorizations, and
clearances obtained under, the HSR Act and all other applicable antitrust,
competition or similar law, rules, regulations, orders or decrees
(including applicable terminations, suspensions, authorizations, orders,
grants, consents, permissions or approvals of Governmental Entities
thereunder), and (b) those set forth on _Schedule 5.3_. Neither the
execution, delivery and performance by such Party of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents to which such Party will be a party nor the consummation
by such Party of the transactions contemplated hereby will (1) conflict with
or result in any breach of any provision of such Partys Governing Documents,
(2) result in a violation or breach of, or cause acceleration, or constitute a
default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which such Party is a party or by which such Party
or any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (3) violate any order,
writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to such Party or any of such Partys
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except in the
case of _clauses (2)_ and  _(3)_ above, for violations which would not
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the Purchase Price and other amounts to be
paid or caused to be paid by Parent at the Closing.

Section 5.4. _Absence of Changes_. Between the date of such Partys formation,
as the case may be, and the date of this Agreement, (a) there has not been a
Parent Material Adverse Effect and (b) each of Parent and Buyer has conducted
its business only in the ordinary course of business.

 



38 Section 5.5. _Brokers_. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment
banker, other than CandCo/Prince Ridge LLC and Stifel, Nicolaus and Company,
Incorporated is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisors or
investment bankers fee or commission or similar payment in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by and on behalf of such Party or any of its Affiliates for which Seller, or
(prior to the Closing) any Group Company, may become liable.

 

Section 5.6. _Solvency_. Such Party is not entering into this Agreement with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. After giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the Purchase Price,
redemption amounts and all related fees and expenses required to be paid by
such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, such Party will be Solvent as of and after the
Closing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means
that, as of any date of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the
fair value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, is greater than the total amount of liabilities,
including contingent liabilities, of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their debts and liabilities
as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are
not about to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons and
its Subsidiaries assets, on a consolidated basis, would constitute
unreasonably small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur
debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as
they mature or otherwise become due;  _provided_ , _however_ , for the
purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be
computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such
contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

 

Section 5.7. _Transactions with Related Parties_. _Schedule 5.7_ sets forth
all material arrangements between the Parent and/or Buyer, on the one hand,
and Affiliates of either Party (other than any employee of Parent and/or Buyer
who is not an executive officer of such Party), on the other hand, that will
not be terminated effective as of the Closing Date. Except as disclosed on
_Schedule 5.7_ and to the knowledge or Parent and Buyer, none of Parent,
Buyer and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees
possesses, directly or indirectly, any financial interest in, or is a
director, officer or employee of, any Person (other than the Buyer) which is a
material client, supplier, customer, lessor, lessee, or competitor of Parent
or Buyer. Ownership of securities of a company whose securities are
registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of five
percent (5%) or less of any class of such securities shall not be deemed to be
a financial interest for purposes of this _Schedule 5.7_.

 



39 Section 5.8. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has received and accepted an executed and binding commitment letter
dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), a
true, complete and correct copy of which is attached as _Exhibit C_ , from the
financial institutions party thereto (the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the
Lenders have committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, the full amount of the debt
financing stated therein (the " _Debt Financing_"). A true, complete and
correct copy of the fee lettersubject to redaction in respect of fee amounts
and "flex" provisions that do not affect the availability of the Debt
Financingexecuted in connection with the Debt Financing is also attached as
_Exhibit C_ (the " _Fee Letter_ ").

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the respective obligations of
the Lenders to provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would
permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. There are
no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter and any related engagement letters)
relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Debt Financing or otherwise affecting the availability of the Debt
Financing. Parent does not have any reason to believe that either it or Buyer
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions in the
Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied by such Party as a condition to the
Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have
knowledge that any of the Lenders will not perform its obligations thereunder.

(c) As of the date hereof and as of the Closing, the Debt Financing, if
funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, together
with the Trust Amount (less any payments required therefrom to redeem shares
of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Offer but assuming the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(g)_ is satisfied in full at Closing),
would provide Parent with cash proceeds in an amount sufficient for payment of
the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, all
amounts required to redeem Public Shares in accordance with the Offer, and all
related fees and expenses.

(d) The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is valid,
binding and enforceable against Parent and the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms (except to the extent enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles), and no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been (on or prior to
the date of this Agreement) or, except as permitted by _Section 6.8(a)_, will
not have been (as of the Closing Date) amended, restated or otherwise modified
or waived and the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified, waived or rescinded on
or prior to the date of this Agreement. No amendment, restatement or other
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter and no withdrawal, termination,
amendment or modification of the financing commitments in the Debt Commitment
Letter is contemplated by Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other party
thereto. Parent has

 



40  paid in full any and all fees and expenses that are payable pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement,
and will timely pay in full any such amounts as they become due.

Section 5.9. _Parent Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or any of its Affiliates expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the filings with the SEC, mailings to Parents
shareholders with respect to the Offer and/or the redemption of Public Shares,
any supplements thereto and/or in any other document filed with any
Governmental Entity in connection herewith (including the Offer Documents),
will, at the date of filing and/or mailing, as the case may be, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (subject to the

be reduced in accordance with the express terms of the Trust Agreement.

Capital Market (" _Nasdaq_ "). 

Section 5.12. _Parent Board Approval_. The Parent Board (including any
required committee or subgroup of such board), at a meeting duly called and
held and acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the independent
disinterested members of the Parent Board, has, as of the date of this
Agreement, unanimously (a) approved and declared the advisability of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, (b) determined that this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are in the
best interests of Parent and its stockholders, and (c) determined that the
transactions contemplated hereby constitute a "Business Combination" as such
term is defined in Parents Governing Documents.

 

Section 5.13. _Parent SEC Documents and Financial Statements_. Parent has
filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents,
including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed or furnished by Parent
with the SEC since Parents formation under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, together with any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto, and
will file all such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Additional Parent SEC Documents_ "). Parent has made available to the

referred to in _clauses (a)_ , _(b)_ , and _(c)_ above, whether or not
available through EDGAR, are, collectively, the (" _Parent SEC Documents_ ").
The Parent SEC Documents were, and the Additional Parent SEC Documents will
be, prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material

(b) To the extent not filed prior hereto, the Company shall prepare or cause
to be prepared, in accordance with applicable law and consistent with past
practice, each Group Company income Tax Return for each Pre-Closing Tax
Period. At least twenty (20) days prior to the date on which a Group Company
income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period is due (after taking into
account any valid extension), the Company shall deliver such Group Company
income Tax Return to the Seller. No later than five (5) days prior to the date
on which a Group Company income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period is
due (after taking into account any valid extension), the Seller may make
reasonable changes and revisions to such Group Company income Tax Return.

 



45 (c) The Company shall prepare and file each Group Company income Tax Return
for any Post-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period in accordance with
applicable law. At least twenty (20) days prior to the date on which a Group
Company income Tax Return for a Straddle Period is due (after taking into
account any valid extension), the Company shall deliver such Group Company

or a refund for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Group Company income

Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date and such Tax was based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that the amount of income Taxes shall not include any amount
payable as a result of the JV Sale unless the aggregate amount of all such
Taxes payable as a result of the JV Sale exceeds $3,000,000 (it being
understood that once this threshold has been exceeded, the amount of income
Taxes payable as a result of the JV Sale shall only include such amounts in
excess of $3,000,000).

Working Capital, Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (or credits in
lieu of refunds) that are received by Parent and/or Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries attributable to Taxes paid by any Group
Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and Parent and Buyer shall pay
over to Seller any such refund (or credit in lieu of refund) within five (5)
Business Days after the later of (i) receipt of or entitlement to such refund

the Group Companies properly reflected on any Group Company income Tax Return
prepared in accordance with  _Section 6.2(b)_ for Pre-Closing Tax Periods

Parent and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to work in good faith and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to diligently prosecute any Tax refund
claims in order to legally maximize and obtain any such Tax refunds or
credits. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and Buyer shall
request a refund (rather than a credit in lieu of refund) with respect to all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns for
the Group Companies for periods ending on or before the Closing Date or for
any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, in
each case, the due date of which is after the Closing Date, (i) all
Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as properly allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date to the extent deductible in
such period and such Tax Returns shall include all such Transaction Tax
Deductions as deductions in the Tax Returns of the Group Companies for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date, and (ii) each Group
Company shall elect to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit from
the tax period ending on the Closing Date, including any Transaction Tax
Deductions, to prior taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by law
(using any available short-form or accelerated procedures (including filing
IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for applicable state, local and
foreign tax purposes) and filing amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary)
and to obtain any potential Tax refunds or claims related thereto. 

 



46 (f) Any Tax sharing or similar agreement with, by or among any Group Company,
on the one hand, and any other Person (other than another Group Company)
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, without liability to any party and
shall have no further effect for any year (whether the current year, a future
year or a past year). Any amounts payable under any Tax sharing or similar
agreement shall be cancelled as of the Closing Date, without any liability to
the Company or the Seller.

 

(g) All sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, real property
transfer or similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising in connection with
the transfer of the Common Shares hereunder shall be borne equally by Parent
and Seller. The Party responsible under applicable law for filing any Tax
Return with respect to Transfer Taxes shall file such Tax Return required to
be filed to report Transfer Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avail themselves of any available
exemptions from any such Taxes, and to cooperate with the other Parties in
providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemptions.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
_Section 6.2(d)_, the Company shall be entitled to receive payment for all
Taxes of the Group Companies properly reflected on any Group Company income
Tax Return prepared in accordance with _Section 6.2(b)_ for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period and/or pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ for any Straddle Period
(collectively, the " _Covered Taxes_ "), in each case, at the Companys
discretion, by either offsetting any Tax refund amounts (or amount of credits
in lieu of refunds) received by Parent and/or Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries which otherwise would be payable to Seller in
accordance with _Section 6.2(e)_ (" _Refundable Amounts_ ") or from the funds
then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (the aggregate amount so
released to Parent and/or Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with this
_Section 6.2(h)_, the " _Escrow Offset Amount_ ") (it being agreed and
acknowledged by the Parties that any funds so paid to the Company from the
Indemnity Escrow Account in respect of Covered Taxes may be replenished
(through one or more deposits by Parent and/or Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, in lieu of payment of such
amount to Seller pursuant to _Section 6.2(e)_) upon the subsequent receipt by
any such Person of any Refundable Amounts during the Survival Period) or any
combination thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, if any Parent
Indemnifiable Claim is timely made and the applicable Parent Indemnified
Parties are unable to recover Losses in respect of such Parent Indemnifiable
Claim in accordance with the terms and limitations set forth in _ARTICLE 9_
directly as a result of any Escrow Offset Amount having been released to
Parent and/or Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
the Indemnity Escrow Account (and not having been replenished) in accordance
with this _Section 6.2(h)_, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 6.2_ and _ARTICLE 9_ , including, but not limited to the
expiration of the Survival Period, such Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to receive, by an offset from the proceeds of any Refundable Amounts
received by Parent and/or Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries otherwise payable to Seller in accordance with  _Section
6.2(e)_, an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of Losses
incurred by such Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of such Parent
Indemnifiable Claim which are properly indemnifiable in accordance with 
_ARTICLE 9_ (including the limitations set forth therein) and (y) the Escrow
Offset Amount. The Parties hereto shall from

 



47  time to time take all actions reasonably necessary to give effect to this
_Section 6.2_. To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 6.2_
and  _ARTICLE 9_, this _Section 6.2_ shall control as to Tax matters.

Section 6.3. _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, upon
reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions contained in the
confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are subject, the
Company shall, and shall cause each other Group Company to provide to Parent,
Buyer and their authorized representatives during normal business hours
reasonable access to all books and records of the Group Companies reasonably
requested (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal
business operations of any Group Company); _provided_ that (a) such access
shall occur in such a manner as the Company reasonably determines to be
appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) all requests for such access shall be directed to a
Designated Contact, and (c) nothing herein shall require the Company to
provide access to, or to disclose any information to, Parent, Buyer or any of
their representatives if such access or disclosure, in the good faith
reasonable belief of the Company, (i) would cause significant competitive harm
to any Group Company if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not consummated, (ii) would waive any legal privilege or (iii) would be in
violation of applicable laws or regulations of any Governmental Entity
(including the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, and other antitrust or
competition laws) or the provisions of any agreement to which any Group
Company is a party. All of such information provided to Parent, Buyer or any
of their Affiliates or representative shall be treated as confidential
information pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
provisions and restrictions of which are by this reference hereby
incorporated herein and expressly made applicable to and enforceable against
Parent and Buyer. Parent and Buyer each agree that it shall (x) be bound by
the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent as Quinpario Partners LLC

Agreement with respect to any such access and information furnished to such
representatives.

and authorizations, including the HSR Act filing fee but excluding all legal

Company in connection therewith, shall be borne by Parent. Each Party agrees
to make an appropriate filing, if necessary, as soon as practicable (and, in
the case of the filing under the HSR Act, in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days) after the date of this Agreement), of a Notification and Report
Form under the 

 



48  HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ") (which filing shall request early termination of the
review period with respect thereto) and, to the extent applicable, make any
filings or notifications with respect to such other approvals or waiting
periods as may be required under other applicable antitrust and competition
laws, rules and regulation (including in non-U.S. jurisdictions). Each Party
shall respond as promptly as practicable to requests from the appropriate
Governmental Entities for additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
antitrust, competition or similar law, rules, regulations, orders or decrees.

Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements so as to expeditiously consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided that_ , for purposes
of this Section 6.4, commercially reasonable efforts shall not include (A)
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by
any party, including appeals, (B) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing
of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of,
any entity, facility or asset of Parent or its Affiliates, (C) terminating,

contractual obligation to a third party) and (D) amending, assigning or
terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than terminations
that would result in a breach of a license or such other agreement with a
third party) and entering into such new licenses or other agreements.

communication to that Party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity acting under an antitrust or competition law with respect

extent practicable not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry under the HSR Act or any other antitrust or

this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements unless it consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat; and (iii) furnish the other Parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, any Governmental

other antitrust or competition Law with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

itself, its Affiliates, its Representatives and shareholders and interest
holders, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any schedule, statement, filing, notice or application made by
or on behalf of any Party or its Affiliates to any Governmental 

 



49  Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, Each Party shall promptly advise the other
Parties upon their or any of their Subsidiaries receiving any communication
from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any approval of such Governmental Entity will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.

 

(e) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against such claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order
is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted,
and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer or the Offer Documents and promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Federal Securities Laws.

shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
circumstance referred to in _clause (y)_ of the immediately
preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, (i) Parent

all amounts required to effect redemptions of shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with the Offer, and to pay all related fees and expenses) on terms
and conditions equivalent or no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and

include Alternative Financing. Parent and Buyer shall, and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives
to, comply with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions of,
the Debt Commitment Letter, any Alternative Financing, the Definitive
Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters.

equity financing of up to $50,000,000 through the issuance of a preferred
equity instrument issued by Parent (together with the Debt Financing, the "

to impair or delay the Closing or the ability of Parent or Buyer to obtain
any portion of the Debt Financing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers, managers, employees,
consultants, counsel, accountants, agents, advisors and other representatives

not be deemed to have breached or failed to perform or observe any covenants,
obligations or other agreements contained in this _Section 6.8(b)_, in each
case, unless the Financing has not been obtained primarily as a result of

than information provided by Seller and its Subsidiaries or to the extent that
such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and other obligations arise from
misconduct of such indemnified parties), including losses, liabilities,
claims, damages and other obligations suffered in connection with complying
with _Section 6.8(b)_ above.

(e) At the Closing, Parent shall make appropriate arrangements to cause the
funds in the Trust Account to be disbursed in accordance with the Trust
Agreement and for the payment of (i) expenses to the third parties to which
they are owed and (ii) the remaining assets in the Trust Account to Parent.

Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against the Lenders (or any of
their Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents) in connection with

hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt
Financing Agreements.

Seller and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with one another and
seek one anothers written approval before issuing any Reviewable Document,
and shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, issue any
such Reviewable Document prior to such consultation and approval; _provided_
that each Party may make any such announcement which it in good faith
believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary or advisable in connection
with any requirement of law or regulation or rule of any applicable national
securities exchange, it being understood and agreed that each Party shall
provide the other Parties with copies of any such announcement in advance of
such issuance; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party may make
internal announcements to their respective employees that are not
inconsistent in any material respects with the Parties prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement,
in

 



55  no event shall either this _Section 6.9_ or any provision of the
Confidentiality Agreement limit disclosure by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(which, after the Closing, shall not include any Group Company) to any direct
or indirect investors in any such Person, as applicable, or in connection with
normal fund raising and related marketing or informational or reporting
activities of Seller or any such Affiliate. Any language included in a
Reviewable Document that reflects the comments of the reviewing party, as well
as any text as to which the reviewing party has not commented upon after being
given a reasonable opportunity to comment, shall be deemed to have
been approved by the reviewing party and may henceforth be used by the other
party in other Reviewable Documents and in other documents distributed by the
other party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without further review or consent of the reviewing party.

Section 6.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

exculpation now existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees and
agents of each Group Company, as provided in such Group Companys Governing
Documents or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof with respect to any
matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force
and effect and that the Group Companies will perform and discharge the Group
Companies respective obligations to provide such indemnity and exculpation.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, such indemnification shall
be mandatory rather than permissive, and Parent shall (or shall cause the
Group Companies to) advance expenses in connection with such indemnification
as provided in such Group Companys Governing Documents or other applicable
agreements. The indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation
provisions of the Group Companies respective Governing Documents shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of
the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of any Group Company, unless such modification
is required by applicable law.

(b) Parent and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to, and the Group
Companies shall, purchase and maintain in effect beginning on the Closing and
for a period of six years thereafter without any lapses in coverage, a "tail"
policy providing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
benefit of those Persons who are covered by Sellers or any Group Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies as of the date hereof
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing. Such policy shall
provide coverage that is at least equal to the coverage provided under the
Group Companies directors and officers liability and fiduciary insurance
most recently maintained by the Group Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Buyer shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such DandO
Insurance in excess of 200% of the Group Companies current annual premium for
DandO Insurance; and _provided_ _further_ that if the annual premium exceeds
such amount, then Buyer shall obtain, or shall cause the Group Companies to
obtain DandO Insurance with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

(c) The directors, officers, employees and agents of Parent and each Group
Company entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation
and insurance set forth

 



56  in this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.10_. This _Section 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Buyer and each Group Company.

Section 6.11.  _Exclusive Dealing_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company and Seller shall not take, nor shall they permit any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any
action to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into any agreement
with any Person (other than Parent, Buyer and/or their respective Affiliates)
concerning any purchase of any of the Companys equity securities or any
merger, sale of substantial assets or similar transaction involving any Group
Company, other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business, the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Shares contemplated hereby and the Rollover
Transaction (each such acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and Buyer hereby acknowledge
that prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has provided information
relating to the Group Companies and the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures and has
afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other Persons in
connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such information,
access and discussions could reasonably enable another Person to form a basis
for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by the Company of this
_Section 6.11_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may respond to
any unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction by indicating
that the Company is subject to an exclusivity agreement and is unable to
provide any information related to the Group Companies and the Non-Controlled
Joint Ventures or entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Transaction for as long
as that exclusivity agreement remains in effect.

 

Section 6.12. _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Parent,
Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause the Group Companies and/or Non-
Controlled Joint Ventures to, until the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business
of the Group Companies and/or Non-Controlled Joint Ventures in existence on
the Closing Date and make the same available for inspection and copying by
Seller during normal business hours of the Group Companies and/or Non-
Controlled Joint Ventures, as applicable, upon reasonable request and
upon reasonable notice. No such books, records or documents shall be
destroyed after the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date by Parent, Buyer
or the Group Companies without first advising Seller in writing and giving
Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof. Each Party
shall cooperate in the defense of any action or inquiry relating to periods
prior to the Closing Date and each shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested by
another Party in connection therewith.

 

Section 6.13. _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Parent and Buyer hereby
agrees that (other than with respect to the Designated Contacts) neither
Parent nor Buyer is authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of
its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any partner,
member, equityholder (other than Seller), officer, director, employee,
customer, supplier,

 



57  distributor, joint-venture partner, lessor, lender or other material
business relation of any Group Company or any Non-Controlled Joint Venture
regarding any Group Company or any Non-Controlled Joint Venture, its business
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Company or Seller.

 

Section 6.14. _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall provide employees of
each Group Company with compensation that is no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation provided to such employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date and with employee benefits that are substantially similar
in the aggregate (determined on a group rather than an individual employee
basis) to the Employee Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans and other
benefit plans, programs, agreements or arrangements maintained by the Group
Companies as of the Closing Date. Each of Parent and Buyer further agree
that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and each Group Company to, grant all Group Company employees credit
for any service with any Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date (a)
for eligibility and vesting purposes and (b) for purposes of vacation accrual
and severance benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that may be established or maintained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates or any Group Company on or after the Closing
Date (the " _New Plans_ "). In addition, Parent and Buyer shall each use their
commercial best efforts to (1) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an employee under any
Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (2)
cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on
or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of
any Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.14_ (i) shall constitute
an amendment to or any other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit Plan, (ii) shall, subject to compliance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.14_, alter or limit any Group Companys
ability to amend, modify or terminate any particular benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement as required by law or (iii) is intended to confer
upon any employee of any Group Company any right to continued employment
for any period beyond any such right which may exist as of the Closing
pursuant to any contract or agreement between any such employee, on the one
hand, and any Group Company, on the other hand. Parent and Buyer each agree
that Parent, Buyer and each Group Company shall be solely responsible for
satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of COBRA for all individuals
who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will (i) attempt in good faith to secure
from each Person who has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result
of or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein that would be
deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (hereafter, " _Section
280G_ ")) a waiver of such Persons rights to all of such payments and/or
benefits (to the extent waived, the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") applicable to
such Person so 

 



58  that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such Person shall
not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section
280G), and (ii) to the extent such waivers are obtained, solicit the approval
of the stockholders of the Company of the Waived 280G Benefits, in a manner
intended to comply with Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 6.15. _Shareholder Vote_. Except as expressly required or permitted by
the terms of this Agreement or consented to in writing by Seller, from and
after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall not directly or indirectly
subject this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or any other transaction or matter to any vote, consent
or approval of the direct or indirect holders of capital stock of Parent.
Except as expressly required or permitted by the terms of this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Parent, from and after the date of this Agreement,
Seller shall not directly or indirectly subject this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any
other transaction or matter to any vote, consent or approval of the direct or
indirect holders of membership interests of Seller.

Section 6.16. _Affiliated Transactions_. Except as noted in such schedule,
(a) the Company shall cause all of the contracts and agreements which are
required to be set forth in _Schedule 3.18_ (regardless of whether they are,
in fact, so listed) to be terminated at or prior to the Closing, and (b)
Parent shall cause all of the contracts and agreements which are required to
be set forth in _Schedule 5.7_ (regardless of whether they are, in fact, so
listed) to be terminated at or prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.17. _No Parent Common Stock Transactions; Listing_. Neither the
Company, Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, shall engage in any transactions involving the securities of
Parent prior to the time of the making of a public announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to require each of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors, contractors, associates, clients, customers and
representatives, to comply with the foregoing sentence. From the date of this
Agreement through the Closing, Parent shall take all reasonable efforts which
are necessary or reasonably desirable for Parent to remain listed as a public
company on, and for shares of Parent Common Stock to be tradable over, the
applicable Nasdaq market(s).

 

Section 6.18. _No Claim Against Trust Account_. Notwithstanding anything else
in this Agreement, the Company and Seller acknowledge that they have read the
Prospectus and understand that Parent has established the Trust Account for
the benefit of Parents public shareholders and that Parent may disburse
monies from the Trust Account only (a) to Parents public shareholders in the
event they elect to have their shares redeemed in accordance with Parents
Charter Documents and/or the liquidation of Parent, (b) to Parent after, or
concurrently with, the consummation of a Business Combination, (c) to Parent
in limited amounts for its working capital requirements and tax obligations,
(d) as repayment of loans and reimbursement of expenses to directors, officers
and founding shareholders of Parent, and (e) to third parties (e.g.,
professionals, printers, etc.) who have rendered services to Parent in
connection with its operations and efforts to effect a Business Combination.
All liabilities and obligations of Parent due and owing or incurred at or
prior to the Closing shall be paid as and when due, including all

 



59  amounts payable (x) to Parents public shareholders in the event they elect
to have their shares redeemed in accordance with Parents Charter Documents
and/or the liquidation of Parent, (y) to Parent after, or concurrently with,
the consummation of a business combination, and (z) to Parent in limited
amounts for its working capital requirements and tax obligations,. The Company
and Seller further acknowledge that, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or, upon termination of this Agreement, another Business
Combination) are not consummated by December 8, 2014, Parent will be obligated
to return to its shareholders the amounts being held in the Trust Account,
unless such date is otherwise extended pursuant to the terms of the
Certificate of Incorporation. Upon the Closing, Parent shall cause the Trust
Account to be disbursed to Parent and as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, the Company and Seller, for each of itself and its
subsidiaries, affiliated entities, directors, officers, employees,
shareholders, representatives, advisors and all other associates and
Affiliates, hereby waive all rights, title, interest or claim of any kind
against Parent to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed
to them by Parent for any reason whatsoever, including to a breach of this
Agreement by Parent or any negotiations, agreements or understandings with
Parent (whether in the past, present or future), and will not seek recourse
against the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever, in each case
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including the
remedies provided in Section 10.14). This paragraph will survive the
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

Section 6.19.  _Parent Borrowings_. Through the Closing, Parent shall be
allowed to borrow funds from its directors, officers, shareholders and/or
their respective affiliates to meet its reasonable capital requirements, with
any such loans to be made only as reasonably required by the operation of
Parent in due course on a non-interest bearing basis and repayable at Closing
(or convertible into Parent Warrants in accordance with the terms of the
promissory notes issued to evidence the borrowing). The proceeds of such
loans shall not be used for the payment of salaries, bonuses or other
compensation to any of Parents directors, officers or shareholders.

 

Section 6.20. _Warrant Tender_. Through the Closing, solely to the extent such
repurchases would not be reasonably likely to impair or delay the Closing or
the ability of Parent or Buyer to obtain any portion of the Debt Financing,
Parent shall be allowed to repurchase its outstanding warrants (and, if so
repurchased, Parent shall be required to cancel such repurchased warrants).
Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to
provide, all necessary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and/or Buyer
in connection with such warrant tender offer and cancellation to same extent
as required pursuant to _Section 6.8(c)_ hereof.

part of a Third Party Claim), suffered or paid by them (collectively, "
_Losses_ ") as a result and to the extent of: (i) any breach of any
representations or warranties by the Company or Seller; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the purpose of
determining whether a representation or warranty has been breached
for purposes of the obligations to indemnify set forth in this _ARTICLE 9_ ,
any qualification with respect to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect
or other similar qualification shall be disregarded (except with respect to 
_Section 3.4(a)_, _Section 3.6_, _Section 3.7_ _Section 3.11(h)_, and
_Section 3.20_) so long as the Losses arising out of or relating to such
breach would exceed $50,000, (ii) any breach by the Company or the Seller of
any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that are
required to be performed prior to the Closing Date and (iii) any Tax for,
attributable to or arising from any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on
or prior to the Closing Date (including any penalties and interest) as
determined pursuant to _Section 6.2_, _provided_ that Losses shall not
include any amount of Taxes payable as a result of the JV Sale unless
the aggregate amount of all such Taxes payable as a result of the JV Sale
exceeds $3,000,000 (it being understood that once this threshold has been
exceeded, Losses shall only include such amounts payable as a result of the JV
Sale in excess of $3,000,000) (" _Parent Indemnifiable Claims_ "). The Parent
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
_ARTICLE 9_ (other than with respect to Parent Indemnifiable Claims under
_clauses (ii)_ or _(iii)_ above) unless the aggregate of all of the
Indemnifying Partys obligations to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ exceeds $5,386,500 (the " _Basket_ "), and once
this threshold has been exceeded, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Parties only for all such obligations in excess of the
Basket, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_ hereof.

 



66 (b) _Indemnification by Parent_. Subject to the other provisions of this
_ARTICLE 9_ , from and after the Closing, Parent (the " _Parent Indemnifying
Party_ ", and together with the Seller Indemnifying Party, the " _Indemnifying
Parties_ ") shall indemnify Seller and each of their Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives, and successors and assigns, as the case may
be (together with the Parent Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") and hold each of them harmless from and against, and reimburse and pay each
of them as actually incurred with respect to, any and all Losses as a result
and to the extent of: (i) any breach of any representations or warranties by
the Parent or Buyer, (ii) any breach by each of the Parent or Buyer of any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and (iii) any Tax
for, attributable to or arising from any Tax period (or portion thereof)
ending on or after the Closing Date (including any penalties and interest).

 

Section 9.3. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Other than with respect to Losses which were the result of fraud, the
maximum amount the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover in
the aggregate with respect to any and all Parent Indemnifiable Claims
hereunder shall be the Indemnification Escrow Amount. The funds in the
Indemnification Escrow Account shall be the sole source of recovery for any
Parent Indemnifiable Claims hereunder, other than with respect to Losses
which were the result of fraud (in the case of fraud, the funds in the
Indemnification Escrow Account shall be the initial source of recovery
hereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, once the funds in the Indemnification
Escrow Account are exhausted, other than with respect to Losses which were the
result of fraud, there shall be no further claim by any Parent Indemnified
Party under this _ARTICLE 9_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon any
Indemnified Party becoming aware of any Indemnifiable Claim, such Indemnified
Party shall utilize all reasonable efforts, consistent with normal practices
and policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate such Losses. For
purposes of this _ARTICLE 9_ , all Losses shall be computed net of (i)
any insurance proceeds actually received (other than pursuant to the RandW
Policy), (ii) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party or any of its
respective Affiliates from any Person with respect to such Losses (whether
under any agreement for indemnification, contribution or otherwise) and (iii)
the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized, in each case by the
Indemnified Party (as applicable, or any Affiliate thereof) that is
attributable to the Losses to which such claim relates, and with respect to
clause (iii) to the taxable period in which such Losses are incurred, treating
any item of loss, deduction or credit as a result of such Losses as the last
item used in such period, and taking into account any Tax detriment suffered
by the Indemnified Parties as a result of such Losses and the receipt of the
related indemnity payment (in the case of _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_
, net of the cost and expense of obtaining any such benefits, proceeds,
payments or reimbursements). The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue, and to cause their respective Affiliates to
pursue, all insurance claims, other third party payments and Tax benefits
to which it or they may be entitled in connection with any Losses incurred.
If any Indemnified Party actually receives any insurance or other third party
payment in connection with any claim for Losses for which it has already 

 



67  received a payment under this _ARTICLE 9_ , it shall pay to Seller or
Parent, as applicable, within thirty (30) days after such payment is received,
an amount equal to the excess of (x) the amount previously received by such
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim plus the amount of such insurance
or other third party payment, less the costs of collection and, if insurance
proceeds are received, any increase in premiums directly caused by the
receipt of such insurance proceeds, over (y) the amount of Losses to which
Parent or Seller, as applicable, has become entitled under this Agreement in
connection with such claim.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
purpose of calculating the amount of any Losses incurred as a result of any
breach of the representations and warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement, any qualification with respect to materiality, Company Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification shall be disregarded (except
with respect to  _Section 3.4(a)_, _Section 3.6_, _Section 3.7_ and
_Section 3.20_).

(d) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary set forth herein, the right
to indemnification, payment of Losses or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties or covenants will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of
or compliance with, any such representation, warranty or covenant.

 

(e) In no event shall any Parent Indemnified Party be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ with respect to any Liability
(including any Liability for Taxes) that is accrued (and then only to the
extent thereof) in or that was otherwise taken into account in the calculation
of the Purchase Price or any payment or offset made or taken pursuant to 
_Section 6.2(h)_.

Section 9.4. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Indemnifying and Indemnified Parties_. Following the incurrence of any
Losses by an Indemnified Party who believes that such party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ , the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to Parent or Seller, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, a notice
of claim (" _Notice of Claim_ ") which shall (i) state that the Indemnified
Party has paid or will have to pay Losses for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_ ; and (ii) specify in
reasonable detail to the extent then known each individual item of
Loss included in the amount so stated and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the actual or estimated
amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder. The
Indemnifying Party shall be permitted to object in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 5 of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) _Third Party Claims_. The obligations and liabilities of Indemnifying
Parties under this _ARTICLE 9_ with respect to Losses arising from actual or
threatened claims or demands by any third party which are subject to the
indemnification provided for in this _ARTICLE 9_ (" _Third Party Claims_ ")
shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and
conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give Parent or Seller, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, notice of such Third Party Claim as soon as
reasonably practicable following, and in any event

 



68  within 30 days of, the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice. The
Notice of Claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the
Parent Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification claim and the
amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. The failure of
the Indemnified Party to provide prompt notice of any claim within the time
periods specified shall not release, waive or otherwise affect Indemnifying
Parties obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Parties are materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
The Indemnifying Party shall be permitted to object to any such Notice of
Claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5 of the Escrow
Agreement.

(c) _Defense of Claims_. The Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled to assume
and control the defense of any Third Party Claim through counsel of its choice
(such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) if (i) it
gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 30
days of receiving notice of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying
Parties have sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment
that is reasonably likely to result; (iii) the Third Party Claim solely seeks
(and continues to seek) monetary damages; (iv) the Third Party Claim does not
include criminal charges and (v) the Third Party Claim were to be decided
adversely to the Indemnifying Party, such a decision could reasonably be
expected to result in Losses for which the Indemnifying Party would be
responsible for a greater portion of the Losses related to such Third Party
Claim than the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Parties do not assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 9.4(c)_,
the Parent Indemnified Party may continue to defend the Third Party Claim. The
Parent Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Parties, at the
Indemnifying Parties expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Parent Indemnified Partys possession or under the Parent
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Parties. Except with the written consent of the Parent
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Parties shall not, in the defense of a
Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
to the Parent Indemnified Party by the third party of a release from
all liability with respect to such suit, claim, action, or proceeding, unless
there is no finding or admission of (A) any violation of law by the Parent
Indemnified Party (or any affiliate thereof), (B) any liability on the part of
the Parent Indemnified Party (or any affiliate thereof) or (C) any violation
of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims of a similar
nature that may be made by the same third party against the Parent Indemnified
Party (or any affiliate thereof).

Section 9.5. _Representations and Warranties Insurance_. Parent will procure a
transaction representations and warranties insurance policy (" _R andW
Policy_"), with Seller bearing 50% of such cost (including any deposits that
may be required at signing to procure such coverage) in an amount not to
exceed $750,000 to Seller (" _Seller Insurance Payment_ "). Parent will
determine the appropriate level and type of coverage. Seller agrees to advance
(or cause Jason to advance), or has already advanced (or caused Jason to
advance), $150,000 for the deposit with respect to the insurance described in
this _Section 9.5_, which amount shall be credited against the Seller
Insurance Payment. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof, to the extent the Seller Insurance Payment
(or related deposit) has been made, such payment shall be reimbursed in full
to Jason within one (1)

 



69  Business Day of the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
that Jason shall not have any right to reimbursement pursuant to this _Section
9.5_ if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is the direct result of a breach by Seller or the Company of its
representations, warranties, obligations or covenants under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.6. _Release of Indemnification Escrow Amount_. Any funds remaining
in the Indemnification Escrow Account as of 5:00 p.m. New York local time on
the date the Survival Period expires shall be released to Seller as promptly
as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , if any Parent Indemnified Party has
given timely notice of a Parent Indemnifiable Claim which specifies the
amount of Losses and such claim is then pending, the Escrow Agent shall retain
a portion of the remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount equal to the amount
of such claimed Losses until it receives joint written instructions of
the Buyer and Seller or a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, upon which the Escrow Agent shall pay such retained portion of
Indemnified Escrow Amount, if any, to the Seller in accordance with this
paragraph.

 

Section 9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
this _ARTICLE 9_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
breach of the covenants, agreements, representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement (including with respect to any matters arising under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended from time to time, or any other Environmental Laws, or relating to
Hazardous Substances), except (a) in the case of fraud by any Person, (b) for
any action seeking specific performance, declaratory judgment or injunctive
relief and (c) for the avoidance of doubt, the remedies set forth in _Section
2.4_.

Section 10.3. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, the
relationship of the Parties, the transaction leading to this Agreement or
contemplated hereby and/or the interpretation and/or enforcement of the
respective rights and duties of the Parties hereunder or related in any way
to the foregoing, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal, substantive

 



72  laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and to
be performed solely within such state, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. The Debt Commitment Letter and
the Fee Letter and the performance thereof by the Debt Financing Sources
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 10.4. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement or the Letter of Intent, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the Party incurring such
fees or expenses; _provided_ that in the event that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Group Companies to, pay all Seller Expenses in accordance with _Section
2.5_; _provided_ , further that the Parties agree that the reference in
Section 6 of the Letter of Intent to the four month anniversary of the Letter
of Intent shall be extended until the Outside Date.

Section 10.5. _Construction; Interpretation_. The headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective
counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of
construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall
be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or
use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules, Exhibits
and Annexes, and not to any particular section, subsection, paragraph,
subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (ii) masculine gender
shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; (iii)
words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa;
(iv) references to a Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns;
(v) the word "extent" in the phrase of "to the extent" shall mean the degree
to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean
simply "if"; (vi) any reference to any month or any day period shall mean the
calendar month or the calendar day period unless expressly specified otherwise
and (vii) whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they are deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation".

Section 10.6. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All exhibits and Schedules, or
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other sections is reasonably apparent on its face. The specification
of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement (or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(f)_ or
_Section 7.3(d)_, as the case may be) or the inclusion of any specific item
in any Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower
amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no

 



73  party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation,
items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 10.7. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.2(b)_, _Section 6.10_, and
_Section 6.14_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ that
each Debt Financing Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors
and assigns is an intended third party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to
enforce the provisions contained in _Section 6.8(f)_, _Section 6.18_, the
last sentence of _Section 8.3_,  _Section 10.3_, the proviso in the first
sentence of _Section 10.8_, _Section 10.11_ and the second paragraph of
_Section 10.12_. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence: (i)
prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right, on behalf of its
equityholders, to pursue equitable remedies pursuant to _Section 10.14_ or,
if such equitable remedies are not sought or are not granted as a remedy,
damages (which Parent and Buyer acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit
of the bargain lost by such equityholders, taking into consideration relevant
matters, including the total amount payable to Sellers and such equityholders
as a result of this Agreement and the time value of money, which, in each
case, shall be deemed in such event to be damages of Seller and shall be
recoverable by Seller); _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights granted
pursuant to this _clause (i)_ will be enforceable on behalf of Sellers
equityholders only by Seller in its sole and absolute discretion; and (ii)
nothing in this Agreement shall modify, alter or otherwise derogate from any
right or remedy available to any Person under the Exchange Act in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 10.8. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company or any Seller contained in this Agreement or the Schedules addresses
a particular issue with specificity, and no breach by the Company or any
Seller exists under such specific provision, the Company shall not be deemed
to be in breach of any other provision of this Agreement (with respect to
such issue) that addresses such issue with less specificity than such specific
provision and if such specific provision is qualified or limited by the
Companys knowledge, or in any other manner, no other provision shall
supersede or limit such qualification in any manner.

Section 10.9. _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may
be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be
an original, but all of which

 



74  shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or scanned
pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to
this Agreement.

Section 10.10. _Knowledge of the Company_. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the phrase "to the Companys knowledge" and "to the knowledge of
the Company" and any derivations thereof shall mean the actual knowledge as of
the date hereof (and shall in no event encompass constructive, imputed
or similar concepts of knowledge), of David Westgate, Stephen Cripe, William
Schultz, John Hengel, Florestan Von Boxberg, Srivas Prasad, Brian French and
David Cataldi, none of whom shall have any personal liability or obligations
regarding such knowledge.

Section 10.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO
(INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING), IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR
OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 10.12. _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (a) submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Delaware,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court and (c) agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other Party with
respect thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or
any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made
on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to
be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.12_,
however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law. Each Party agrees that a final, non-appealable
judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.12_ to the contrary, each of the
Company, Seller, Parent and Buyer agrees that it will not bring or support
any legal action, suit or proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any related financing), including any dispute arising out of or

 



75  relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than any New York State court or federal court sitting in the
County of New York and the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts
thereof). The provisions of this _Section 10.12_ shall inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, each Debt Financing Source, its Affiliates and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby
intended to be an express third party beneficiary of this _Section 10.12_.

Section 10.13. _Waiver of Conflicts; Jointly Privileged Information_.

(a) Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has acted as legal counsel
to Seller, its Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and its
Affiliates (which will no longer include the Group Companies) after the
Closing, each of Parent, Buyer and the Group Companies hereby waives, on its
own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Seller and/or its
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent,
Buyer, any Group Company or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition,
all communications involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, its
Affiliates or any Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the
Group Companies shall not have access to any such communications, or to the
files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to engagement, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) Seller and its Affiliates (and not
the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group
Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall
hold such property rights and (iii) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and any of the Group Companies or
otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall be permitted to copy (or, in the case of any of the
following information that is related to the Transaction, to remove) from the
Group Companies any email, document and other records containing attorney-
client privileged information where the attorney-client privilege is held
jointly between one or more of the Group Companies on the one hand, and any of
Seller and its Affiliates on the other hand (" _Jointly
Privileged Information_ "). From and after the Closing, Parent and Buyer
shall cause the Group Companies to provide to Seller copies (including
electronic, digital, or otherwise) of any Jointly Privileged Information that
is inadvertently not copied or removed (as applicable) prior to the Closing.
Seller agrees that any email, document and other record temporarily removed
for analysis to determine the presence of Jointly Privileged Information
pursuant to the first sentence of this  _Section 10.13(b)_ shall be returned
to the Group Companies promptly following completion of such review if it is
determined by Seller that such email, document or other record does not
contain Jointly Privileged Information.

 



76 Section 10.14. _Remedies_. As a material inducement for each Party to enter
into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each
of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be
irreparably damaged and that a Party would not have any adequate remedy at law
in the event that any of the term or provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise are breached or
threatened to be breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties hereby agrees that the other
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of any of the term
or provision of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance
by any other party under this Agreement, and each Party hereby agrees to waive
the defense in any such suit that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at
law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety
of injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive
(a) any claim that the Party seeking such relief has an adequate remedy at law
and (b) any requirement to post any bond, in each case, in connection with
obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in this _Section
10.14_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law
or in equity that the Parties may elect to pursue. Subject to the foregoing,
each of the Parties hereto agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other parties under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and the Company will not
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or specific performance to enforce
the obligations of Parent or Buyer to effect the Closing pursuant to _Section
2.2 _unless: (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.2 _would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at such
time; and (ii) with respect to any funding of the Debt Financing to occur at
the Closing, Seller has irrevocably confirmed that if the Debt Financing is
funded, then the Closing will occur.

 

Section 10.15. _No Recourse_. All actions, claims, obligations, liabilities or
causes of actions (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
in any manner to: (a) this Agreement, (b) the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), (c) any
breach of this Agreement and (d) any failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated (including any Debt Financing), may be
made only against (and, without prejudice to the rights of any express
third party beneficiary to whom rights under this Agreement inure pursuant to
_Section 10.7_), are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly
identified as parties to this Agreement and (other than by Parent or Buyer
with respect to claims arising under the Debt Commitment Letter) not against
any Released Party. No other Person, including any director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, optionholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or
lender (including any Debt Financing Source) to, any party to this Agreement,
or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any
financial advisor or lender (including any Debt Financing Source) (each of the
foregoing, a " _Released Party_ ") to any of the foregoing shall have any
liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted
by statute whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or

 



77  limited liability company veil) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or
related in any manner to the items in the immediately preceding _clauses (a)_
through _(d)_ and (other than claims of Parent and/or Buyer arising under the
Debt Commitment Letter) each Party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
hereby irrevocably releases and forever discharges each of the Released
Parties from any such liability or obligation.
