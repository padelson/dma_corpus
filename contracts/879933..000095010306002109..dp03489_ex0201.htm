 ARTICLE 2 
 THE MERGER

 

  Section 2.01. _The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company
in accordance with Kentucky Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation").

 

  (b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk
and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to
the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
(the "Closing Date").

 

  (c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file
articles of merger with the Kentucky Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Kentucky Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the
articles of merger are duly filed with the Kentucky Secretary of State (or at
such later time as permitted by Kentucky Law as Parent and the Company shall
agree and shall be specified in the articles of merger).

 

 7    
  
     

  (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the properties, rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be
subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities
of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Kentucky Law.

 

  Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time:

 

  (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04,
each share of Company Common Stock (including each Company Restricted Share)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the
Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be converted into the right
to receive $66.00 in cash, without interest (such per share amount, the
"Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and (B) each uncertificated
share of Company Common Stock (an "Uncertificated Share") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the stock transfer
books of the Company, shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

 

  (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
together with the Company Rights attached to each such share shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

  (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company with the Companys
prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section through the Exchange Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a) . Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions to be in such form and have such
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk

 

 8    
  
     

 of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in
such exchange.

 

  (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled
to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

  (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

  (d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 2.

 

  (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent,
and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company

 

 9    
  
     

 Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

  Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Kentucky Law shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such
shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of shares, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

  Section 2.05. _Stock Options and Other Equity Awards._ (a) At or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under any employee stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (each, a "Company Stock
Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled, and the
Company shall pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the
Effective Time for each such Company Stock Option surrendered an amount in
cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased
(assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had such holder exercised
such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

  (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Restricted Share shall vest and become free of such other lapsing
restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.02(a) .

 

  (c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock unit award representing the right to receive shares of
Company Common Stock granted pursuant to any equity or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company (each, a "Company Restricted Stock Unit") shall
vest and become free of such other lapsing restrictions as of the Effective
Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled, and the Company shall
pay each

 

 10    
  
     

 holder of any such restricted stock unit at or promptly after the Effective
Time for each such Company Restricted Stock Unit surrendered an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of
units covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit that have not been
settled or paid immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain any consents
from holders of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units and
make any amendments to the terms of such equity or compensation plans or
arrangements that are necessary, if any, to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock Option or
Company Restricted Stock Units until such necessary consents are obtained.

 

  Section 2.06. _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision
or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted.

 

  Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts and duly pays over such amounts to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or Company
Restricted Stock Unit in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 

  Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this Article 2.

 

 11

the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where

true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

  Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
shareholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The

 binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity).

has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and the

adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders (such
recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation").

 

  Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of the articles of merger with respect to the Merger with the Kentucky
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act or any other
applicable Competition Laws, (iii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other applicable U.S.
state or federal securities laws (the consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required
under or in connection with any of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii)
above, the "Required Governmental Authorizations") and (iv) any actions or
filings the absence of which would not be reasonably expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
result in a material impairment in the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 4.04. _Non-contravention._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent
or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default,
under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other
change of any right

 

 13    
  
     

 or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license,
franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization
affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with such exceptions,
in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not be reasonably
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or result in a material impairment in the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 4.05. _Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of (i) 40,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) 2,000,000 shares of Class A Preferred Stock, par value $10.00 per share

statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (x)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date

Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained
in any such certifications are complete and correct. For purposes of this
Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are

  Section 4.09. _Disclosure Documents._ The proxy statement of the
Company to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "Company
Proxy Statement") and any amendments or supplements thereto will, when filed,

the 1934 Act. __ At the time the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or

Subsidiaries that, if taken during

Material Adverse Effect on the Company or result in a material impairment in
the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has paid (or has had paid
on its behalf) or has withheld and remitted to the appropriate Taxing
Authority all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Tax Returns, except

the Company SEC Documents reflect in accordance with GAAP, an adequate accrual
for Taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
through the date of such financial statements.

 

  (c) All federal income and franchise Tax Returns and all material
state, local or foreign income and franchise Tax Returns of the Company and

Regulation section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), or (II) as a transferee or successor.

 

  (f) During the five-year period ending on the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries was a distributing corporation

identifying each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, each employment, severance or similar Contract, plan or policy and each
other plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation,
bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related rights or other
forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance
(including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits,
employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers

Affiliate of the Company and covers any employee, director, former employee or
former director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability. Copies of
such plans (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or
insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations
thereof have been furnished to Parent together with the most recent annual
report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule

 

 23    
  
     

 B thereto) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust. Such plans
are referred to collectively herein as the "Employee Plans."

 

  (b) Other than a Multiemployer Plan, neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company nor any predecessor thereof sponsors, maintains or
contributes to, or has in the past sponsored, maintained or contributed to,
any Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

 

  (c) To the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that could
present a material risk of complete or partial withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan which could result in the Company, any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate of any of them incurring a withdrawal liability within the
meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA, and if a complete withdrawal by the Company
and all of its ERISA Affiliates were to occur as of the Closing Date with
respect to all Multiemployer Plans, none of the Company, any Subsidiary or
any of their ERISA Affiliates would incur any material withdrawal liability
under Title IV of ERISA.

 

  (d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter that it is so
qualified, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an
application for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and the
Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter should be
revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to Parent prior to
date of this Agreement copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. To the
knowledge of the Company, each Employee Plan has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. To the knowledge of the
Company, no events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could
result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any excise taxes
under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of
the Code.

 

  (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to each current or former employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or together
with any other event: (i) entitle any such person to severance pay, bonus
amounts, retirement benefits, job security benefits or similar benefits, (ii)
trigger or accelerate the time of payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits payable to any such person,
(iii) accelerate the vesting of any compensation or benefits of any such
person (including any stock options or other equity-based awards, any
incentive compensation or any deferred compensation entitlement) or (iv)
trigger any other material obligation to any such person. There is no Contract
or plan (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,

 

 24    
  
     

 individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m)
of the Code. Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all the
agreements, arrangements and other instruments which give rise to an
obligation to make or set aside amounts payable to or on behalf of the
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or any subsequent employment termination

action pursuant to such requirement would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

  (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.03(b) unless the

Person acting in good faith would reasonably believe is seeking to make, or

account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result
in a transaction (i) that if consummated, is more favorable to Companys
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger or, if
applicable, any written proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, taking into account any governmental and other approval
requirements), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the
terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the person making the
proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial, legal and other
aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

  Section 6.04. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ From the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors
and other authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours and with

 

 36    
  
     

 reasonable advance notice, to its offices, properties, books and records,
(ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business and properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to cooperate with Parent in its investigation. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company.
All information furnished pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of July 6, 2006, between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company
hereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated
to provide access to, or to disclose, any information to Parent if
the Company reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries or violate any Applicable Law. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be directed to an executive officer of
the Company or such Person as may be designated by the Companys executive
officers.

  Parent agrees that:

 

  Section 7.01. _Conduct of Parent._ From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, except with the Companys prior written consent,

warranty of the Parent hereunder inaccurate in any material respect at, or as
of any time before, the Effective Time or would materially delay the Closing.

 

  Section 7.02. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
to the fullest extent permitted by Kentucky Law or any other Applicable Law or
provided under the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on
the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

 

  (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys

the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that, in satisfying its obligation
under this Section 7.04(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the

disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

  (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

 

  (d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Kentucky Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

  Section 7.05. _Employee Matters._ (a) For a period ending on December
31, 2007, Parent shall cause to be provided to each individual who is employed
by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than those individuals covered by collective bargaining agreements) and
who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation or any of Parents
Subsidiaries (each an "Affected Employee") (i) base salary and bonus
opportunity no less than

 

 38    
  
     

 what was provided to such Affected Employee under the Employee Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the
Affected Employee under the Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective

and welfare New Company Plans in which such Affected Employee may be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time, (ii) provide credit towards any
deductible or out-of-pocket expense maximum under any health and welfare New
Company Plans for out-of-pocket amounts expended by the Affected Employee
under the Employee Plans during the current calendar year and (iii) recognize
service of Affected Employees (or otherwise credited by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) accrued prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
to participate in and vesting credit under (but not for the purposes of
benefit accrual) any New Employee Plan in which such Affected Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, provided, however, that in
no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

  (c) Each of the Parent and the Company acknowledges on behalf of itself
and its Subsidiaries that the Merger shall constitute a "Change of Control" or
a "Change in Control," as applicable under the Employee Plans.

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or in any of clauses (1)
through (4) the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
providing for such action).

 

  (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 11.04, it
shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amount.

 

  Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto
agree that disclosure of any item, matter or event in a particular Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section or subsection, as applicable, of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representation and warranty of such party that is
contained in another Section or subsection of this Agreement, but only so long
as the application to any such other Section or subsection is
readily apparent from such disclosure. By listing matters on the Company
Disclosure Schedule, Company shall not be deemed to have established any
materiality standard, admitted any liability, or concluded that any one or
more of such matters are material, or expanded in any way the scope or effect
of the representations and warranties of Company contained in this Agreement.

 

  Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in
Section 7.04, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.04, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

  (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other
party

 

 48    
  
     

 hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due
to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 

  Section 11.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (other than
with respect to matters relating to fiduciary duties of the Companys Board
of Directors, the Merger and any other matters governed by Kentucky Law, with
respect to which Kentucky Law shall apply), without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such state.

 

  Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have
subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any
cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen
from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

  Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

  Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party

 

 49    
  
     

 hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 

  Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter thereof.

 

  Section 11.12. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

  Section 11.13. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any court specified in Section 11.08, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.
