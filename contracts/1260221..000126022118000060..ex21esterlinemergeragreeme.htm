sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally

Article I 

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL. By virtue of the
Merger, at the Effective Time, (a) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and (b) the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

Section 1.01 Effective Time. The Company shall file a certificate of merger
that has been duly executed and acknowledged in accordance with, and in such
form as required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware substantially
concurrently with the Closing. The Merger shall become effective at the time
of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such other time as may be mutually agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger
(the time as of which the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

Section 1.02 The Closing. The Parties shall consummate the Merger (such
consummation, the "Closing") at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP, 300 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90071, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern
time on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, but no later than the
third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in Article VI (except for those conditions to the
Closing that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) unless
another time, date or place is mutually agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, "Closing Date" means the date on which
the Closing occurs.

Section 1.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and
in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the
DGCL and other applicable Law.

Section 1.04 Organizational Documents. As of the Effective Time, subject to
Section 5.10, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated to be the same as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law,
except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Esterline
Technologies Corporation." As of the Effective Time, subject to Section 5.10,
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be
the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance
with applicable Law, except that the effective date of such bylaws shall be
the Closing Date and the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Esterline
Technologies Corporation."

Section 1.05 Surviving Corporation Directors and Officers. As of the Effective
Time, (a) the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers
of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK‑ENTRY SHARES

Section 2.01 Effect of Merger on Capital Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company
Stockholder:

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.20 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") held (A) in the Company's treasury, (B) by the Company
or any wholly owned Company Subsidiary or (C) by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange
therefor or in respect thereof;

(ii) except as provided in Section 2.01(a)(i) and Section 2.04, and subject to
Section 2.01(b) and Section 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to $122.50 (the "Merger
Consideration"), without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding
of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.02(g); and

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of
immediately after the Closing.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
shall occur in the outstanding Company Shares because of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend (with the record date for such dividend falling during
such period), reverse stock split, exchange, consolidation of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration and
any other similarly dependent terms shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.02 Payment of Shares of Company Common Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, all Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, upon the cancellation or conversion thereof in accordance
with Section 2.01, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and all holders of stock certificates ("Stock Certificates") or book-entry
shares ("Book-Entry Shares") representing Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
Company Stockholders, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each Company Share evidenced thereby as provided in Section
2.01 (or appraisal rights as provided in Section 2.03 with respect to
Dissenting Shares, or the Company Option Consideration, Company RSU
Consideration or Company PSU Consideration as provided in Section 2.04 with
respect to the Company Equity Awards).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate the Company's current
transfer agent or select a bank or trust company mutually agreeable to Parent
and the Company to act as the paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
Company Stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(ii). Parent shall enter into an agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Paying Agent relating to services to be
performed by the Paying Agent in its capacity as Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(ii) (the amounts collectively, the "Payment Fund"). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in the Merger and as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement. In the event the Payment Fund shall at any time be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(ii), Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. If Parent decides to invest the Payment Fund, then the Payment Fund
shall be invested as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, that (i) such
investments shall be in (A) short‑term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States
and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, (B) commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A‑1 or P‑1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively or (C) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, and (ii) no such investment shall
have a maturity of more than thirty (30) days. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall become part of the Payment Fund and any
amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall
promptly be paid to Parent upon demand. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through
any

* * *



investment made pursuant to this Section 2.02(b). Nothing in this Agreement
and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Stock Certificates or Book‑Entry Shares
to receive, or Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay,
such holder's applicable portion of the Merger Consideration.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not
later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to commence mailing to each Person who was, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares (i) in the
case of Stock Certificates, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery of Stock Certificates shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass, upon delivery
of the Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Paying Agent may reasonably
agree, subject to the Company's reasonable approval, and shall be prepared
prior to Closing) and (B) customary instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Stock Certificates, and (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
customary instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Book-Entry
Shares, in each case, in exchange for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which each Company Share evidenced by such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, has been converted pursuant
to this Article II. Upon (1) in the case of Stock Certificates, delivery to
the Paying Agent of Stock Certificates, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, or (2) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form and such other evidence of
surrender, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, the holders
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which each
Company Share evidenced by such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, has been converted pursuant to this Article II, and the Stock
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of Merger Consideration
may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered
if (I) such Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (II) the Person requesting such payment shall either (x) pay any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of such payment or (y) establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent that such transfer tax either has been paid in full or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each
Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which each Company Share evidenced thereby has been
converted pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid on the
portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(d) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.02(c), upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such



5

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

* * *



Stock Certificate, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to such Person
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii) with respect
to each Company Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains undistributed to former holders of Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares one (1) year after the Closing Date shall be delivered
by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Any former holders of Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.02 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) for payment of any
portion of the Merger Consideration, in accordance with this Article II and
without any interest thereon, payable with respect to each Company Share
previously evidenced by such Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for the portion of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
not have been surrendered prior to the date that any unclaimed portion of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Stock Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) The Paying Agent shall accept such Stock Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries with respect to
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the cash or other Merger Consideration payable hereunder.

(g) Each of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Company
Common Stock or any holder of Company Equity Awards or any other consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or such amounts as it is required
by Law to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall
timely remit the amounts so withheld to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock, holder of Company Equity Awards or other recipient of
consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.03 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such Company
Shares who are entitled to demand and who properly exercise



6

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

* * *



and perfect appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section
262 of DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and holders of such Dissenting Shares
will be entitled only to the right to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such Company Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted into and have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes, and such Company Shares shall
not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt
written notice of any written demand for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of
Dissenting Shares, and to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands for appraisal prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment, settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, or, in each case, agree to do
any of the foregoing, with respect to any such demand without Parent's prior
written consent.

Section 2.04 Company Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled
and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A)
the Merger Consideration over (B) the per‑share exercise price for such
Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Shares
underlying such Company Option, without interest (the "Company Option
Consideration"); provided, that, if the per-share exercise price of any such
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay the Company Option
Consideration to each holder of a Company Option, less any Taxes withheld
pursuant to Section 2.02(g), if such holder was awarded the Company Option as
an employee of any Company Entity, through the payroll of the Surviving
Corporation or Company Entity, as applicable, and if such holder was not
awarded the Company Option as an employee of any Company Entity, then Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to make such payment, in each case, within five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled
and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Company Shares underlying such Company RSU, multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration, without interest (the "Company RSU Consideration"). The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay the Company RSU Consideration to each holder of a Company RSU, less



7

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

* * *



any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.02(g), if such holder was awarded the
Company RSU as an employee of any Company Entity, through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation or Company Entity, as applicable, and if such holder was
not awarded the Company RSU as an employee of any Company Entity, then Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to make such payment, in each case, within five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any
Company RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the applicable settlement date for such Company RSU if required in order to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (treating for this
purpose any performance-based vesting condition to which such Company PSU is
subject as having been attained at the "target level" with proration), shall
be converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Company Shares underlying such Company PSU, multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable Tax withholding
in accordance with Section 2.02(g) (the "Company PSU Consideration"). The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay the portion of the Company PSU Consideration, less any required
withholding of Taxes, payable pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) through the
payroll of the Surviving Corporation or Company Entity, as applicable (to the
extent such Person was awarded the Company PSU as an employee of any Company
Entity, and if such Person was not awarded the Company PSU as an employee of
any Company Entity, the Paying Agent shall make such payment), to each holder
of a Company PSU within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of any Company PSU which immediately prior to such
cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of
the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company PSU
if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if

terms of the Company SAYE Scheme and Applicable Laws, the holders of SAYE
options shall be allowed to exercise their SAYE options in the 20 day period
leading up to the Effective Date in accordance with paragraph 6E of Schedule 3
to the UK Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. To the extent not so
exercised, at the Effective Time, each Company SAYE Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
immediately lapse. If the holder does not exercise his or her SAYE options
within the 20 day period prior to the Effective Date and the SAYE options
lapse, the holder will have a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the per‑share exercise price for such lapsed Company
SAYE Option, multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (A) the accumulated amount in
the holder's Company SAYE Scheme savings account immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (B) the per-share exercise price for the holder's
Company SAYE Option, without interest (the "Company SAYE Option
Consideration"); provided, that, if the per-share exercise price of any such

lapsed Company SAYE Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, the holders of such lapsed Company SAYE options shall not be
entitled to any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect
thereof other than a return of the savings made by the holder of the lapsed
Company SAYE Option. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay the Company SAYE Option Consideration to
each holder of a Company SAYE Option, less any Taxes withheld pursuant to
Section 2.02(g), if such holder is Continuing Company Personnel, through the

Time.

applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with
respect to any outstanding Offering (as such term is defined in the Company
ESPP), the Offering under the Company ESPP shall terminate and a Purchase Date
(as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall occur upon the earlier to
occur of (x) the day that is five (5) trading days prior to the Effective Time
or (y) the date on which such Offering would otherwise end, and no additional
Offerings shall commence under the Company ESPP; (ii) no individual
participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the
amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required
by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP
on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual who is not
participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may

Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to, and there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of, Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be cancelled against
delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in Section
2.01(a)(ii), for each Company Share formerly represented by such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

contained in such documents under the heading "Risk Factors" and any
disclosure of risks included in any "forward‑looking statements" disclaimer or
other statements that are similarly nonspecific or predictive, cautionary or
forward‑looking) where the relevance of the information to a particular
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure, (y) as set forth in the corresponding section or sections of the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
concurrently with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Letter"), or (z) any exception or disclosure set

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, if such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Company
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, as applicable, would not reasonably be expected to result in,

Company Entity has all requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case
may be, power and authority to enable it to own, operate, lease or otherwise
hold its assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, except
where the failure to have such power or authority would not reasonably be

Adverse Effect. Each Company Entity is duly qualified or licensed to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its businesses or the
ownership, operation or leasing of its assets make such qualification
necessary, except in any such jurisdiction where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Certificate of
Incorporation") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the
"Bylaws"), each as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The

in any material respect.

fully paid and nonassessable, are free and clear of Liens (except Permitted
Liens) and are free of preemptive rights. Section 3.02(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists all of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this

Disclosure Letter, the Company owns, beneficially and of record,

Section 3.07 Company Reports; Financial Statements.

(a) The Company has furnished to or filed with the SEC on a timely basis all
reports, schedules, registration statements, forms, statements and other

2015 (such documents, together with all exhibits, financial statements,
including the Company Financial Statements, certifications and schedules and
amendments thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference, but
excluding the Proxy Statement, being collectively referred to as the "Company
Reports"). Each Company Report (i) at the time furnished or filed, complied,
or if not yet furnished or filed, will comply, in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder), as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company Report and (ii) did not at
the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment
prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or
amendment) and for Company Reports furnished to or filed with the SEC after
the date of this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company Report
that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable,
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement,
did not, and any such registration statement that becomes effective after the
date of this Agreement, will not, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no material amendments or modifications to the
Company Reports that were required to be filed with (or furnished to) the SEC
prior to the date of this Agreement, but that have not yet been filed with (or
furnished to) the SEC. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (the
"Company Financial Statements") complied at the time it was filed with (or
furnished to) the SEC, or if not yet furnished or filed, will comply at the
time of filing as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10‑Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods and as of the dates involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presents, or, in the case of
Company Financial Statements, included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports furnished or filed after the date of this

cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, to the absence of footnote disclosure and to normal
fiscal year‑end adjustments).

(b) No Company Entity has any material liability, except liabilities: (i)
reflected or reserved against in the most recent balance sheet (including the
notes thereto) of the Company Entities included in the Company Reports filed
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Balance Sheet Date"); (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the Company
Financial Statements; (iii) incurred in connection with the Merger or any
other transaction or agreement contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv) that

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as reflected in
the Company Reports, no Company Entity is a party to, nor does it have any
obligation or other commitment to become a party to, any material "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act).

(c) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a‑15(f) or 15d‑15(f), as applicable, under
the Exchange Act) that is effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects. The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company Report that is
a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment. There are no
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Oversight Board, as in effect on the date
of this Agreement) in the design or operation of the Company's internal
controls and procedures that have been identified by the Company's auditors,
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data. To the Knowledge of the
Company, since October 3, 2015 to the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor the Company's independent registered accountant has identified or
been made aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the
management or other employees of the Company who have a significant role in
the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Since October 3,
2015, to the Knowledge of the Company, no written complaints from any
Governmental Authority regarding a material violation of accounting
procedures, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have been
received by the Company.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are effective to
ensure that all information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the



15

* * *



chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the SEC has not provided comments to the
Company in connection with any Company Report that, to the Knowledge of the
Company, remain unresolved.

(f) The Company is, and since October 3, 2015 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the applicable listing and governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to the Company Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company does not
have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(a) Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company in this Agreement, (ii) compliance by the Company with the covenants
contained in this Agreement required to be performed and complied with by it,

(including cash, cash equivalents, available lines of credit or other sources
of immediately available funds) in an amount sufficient to consummate the

executed copies of (a) a debt commitment letter (including all exhibits,

other hand, pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
the Initial Lenders (as defined in the Commitment Letter) have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent (the provision of such funds as
set forth therein, the "Financing") for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for the other purposes set
forth therein, and (b) the related fee letter (the "Fee Letter," and
collectively with the Commitment Letter, the "Debt Letters")



32

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

* * *



redacted in a customary manner solely with respect to the fee amounts, pricing
caps and other economic terms (including economic "flex" provisions), which
redacted information does not adversely affect the amount, availability, or
conditionality of the funding of the Financing. As of the date hereof, (i) the
Commitment Letter and the commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have
not been terminated, withdrawn, repudiated, rescinded, amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect and (ii) to the Knowledge of
Parent, no such termination, withdrawal, repudiation, rescission, amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver is contemplated (other than any such
amendment, modification, or restatement solely to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who have not executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) (provided that the existence or
exercise of "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall not be deemed
to constitute an amendment or modification of the Commitment Letter or the
commitments). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies directly or indirectly related to the funding of the Financing
pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter. At the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub will have sufficient
funds to pay all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this

all fees, costs and expenses to be paid in connection therewith, including
such fees, costs and expenses relating to the Financing. As of the date of

without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i) constitute a breach or
default on the part of Parent under the Commitment Letter or, to Knowledge of
Parent, any other party to the Commitment Letter, (ii) constitute or result in
a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter, (iii) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements,
representations and warranties set forth in the Commitment Letter inaccurate
in any material respect, or (iv) to the Knowledge of Parent, otherwise result
in any portion of the Financing to be unavailable. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, or Contracts related
to the funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter and other than customary fee credit letters, none of which
affect conditionality, the amount of the Financing or could reasonably be
expected to delay Closing. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees
and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof under the
terms of the Commitment Letter and will pay all other commitment fees and
other fees as required to be paid under the terms of the Commitment Letter
upon the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement,
and compliance by the Company with the covenants contained in this Agreement
required to be performed and complied with by it, as of the Closing Date,
Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Letters) that any of the conditions to
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a
timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Closing) or
that the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
will not be made available on or prior to the Closing Date.

of 5,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. All outstanding
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub are duly authorized, validly issued,

reasonable best efforts to cause, its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease all existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Person (except for the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective

Representatives) conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to
any Company Takeover Proposal, request in writing the prompt return or

Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (x) such Company Takeover
Proposal, inquiry or proposal either constitutes a Superior Company Proposal
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Company Proposal and
(y) the failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below

proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise
result from a material breach of this Section 5.02, the Company and its
Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company
Entities to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such
Person's Representatives) (provided that all such information has previously
been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrently
with the time it is provided to such Person(s)), if prior to so furnishing
such information, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement that includes terms that are no less restrictive of
such Person than the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (B)
participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover
Proposal, including terms of a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
thereto, and the negotiation of such terms and such Company Acquisition
Agreement with the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such
Person's Representatives).

(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.02(a), Section 5.02(c), Section 5.02(d)

cause or allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into,

agreement or commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or that would reasonably
be expected to cause, the Company to abandon or terminate this Agreement or
delay in any material respects or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") (any action in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to the
Company's receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(c)(i), in each case, if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisor) that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i), as
applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the
Company Board may not make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or so
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i) unless: (i) the
Company Board has delivered to Parent, at least (3) Business Days in advance,
prior written notice that the Company Board is prepared to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(c)(i) (a "Recommendation Change Notice"), which Recommendation
Change Notice shall, (A) attach the most current draft of any proposed Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Company Proposal and (B)
include a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Company Proposal; and (ii) if requested by Parent, during the three (3)
Business Day period after delivery of the Recommendation Change Notice, the
Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement committed to in
writing by Parent and the Company represents that the Company Board shall take
into account any such revisions; provided, however, that, if any material
revisions are made to any such Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall
notify Parent of such revisions in writing and, if requested by Parent, during
the three (3) Business Day period after delivery of such notice, the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement committed to in
writing by Parent and the Company represents that the Company Board shall take
into account any such revisions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and other than
in connection with a Superior Company Proposal, at any time prior to receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a Company Intervening
Event, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; provided, however, that the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, of the Company
Board's intention to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and the
reasons therefor; and provided, further, that the Company represents that the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement or other mitigating factors or structural changes proposed by Parent
in response to such prior written notice or otherwise, and during such three
(3) Business Day period the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations
with Parent regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement or other
mitigating factors or structural changes proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Section 7.01, the Company shall hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting



44

* * *



in accordance with Section 5.04 for purposes of obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation.

(e) The Company shall (i) reasonably promptly (but in no event more than
twenty-four (24) hours) following receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal,
notify Parent in writing of such Company Takeover Proposal and, in the case of
any such notice to Parent as to receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal, set
forth the material terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal and
the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal and (ii)
thereafter promptly keep Parent fully informed on a current basis of any
material change to the terms and status of any such Company Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the generality of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the
Company shall provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
receipt or delivery) copies of any written Company Takeover Proposal
(including draft agreements or term sheets) received by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary from the Person making a Company Takeover Proposal (or such
Person's Representatives) and of all written non-public material provided by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the Person making a Company Takeover
Proposal (or to such Person's Representatives) that was not previously
provided to Parent and is related to such Company Takeover Proposal or is
being provided pursuant to the confidentiality agreement executed by the
Company and such Person. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company
from complying with its obligations under this Agreement, including providing
such information to Parent.

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) complying
with Rule 14d‑9 and Rule 14e‑2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in
the good‑faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
provided, however, that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or any other
disclosure that relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company, in connection with such disclosure, publicly states that the Company
Board expressly rejects the applicable Company Takeover Proposal or expressly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Company Takeover Proposal" means any proposal, offer or indication of
interest (whether or not in writing) from any Person, with respect to any (A)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company, pursuant to which any such Person
(including such Person's or resulting company's direct or indirect
stockholders) would



45

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

* * *



own or control, directly or indirectly, twenty percent (20%) or more of the
voting power of the Company, (B) sale, contribution or other disposition,
directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of
capital stock of or other equity interests in a Company Subsidiary or
otherwise) of any business or assets (including equity securities of any
Company Subsidiary) of the Company Entities representing twenty percent (20%)
or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company
Entities, taken as a whole, (C) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly
or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (D) transaction
(including any tender offer or exchange offer) in which any Person (or the
stockholders of any Person) would acquire (in the case of a tender offer or
exchange offer, if consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership,
or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, any
class of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company representing
twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company or (E) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(ii) "Superior Company Proposal" means a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal (provided, that, for purposes of this definition, references in the
definition of Company Takeover Proposal to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be
deemed references to "fifty percent (50%)"), which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, and taking into account the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal and such other
factors that are deemed relevant by the Company Board, is (A) more favorable
to the Company Stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any proposed
revisions to the terms of this Agreement that are committed to in writing by
Parent (including pursuant to Section 5.02(c))) and (B) reasonably capable of
being completed in a reasonable timeframe.

(iii) "Company Intervening Event" means any Effect that occurs after the date
of this Agreement that prior to the date of this Agreement was neither known
nor reasonably foreseeable and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
expected benefits of the Merger to the Company Stockholders from a financial
point of view; provided, however, that in no event shall a Company Intervening
Event arise from (A) the receipt, existence of or terms of any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry relating thereto or the consequences thereof
or (B) any Effect or Effects that has or have a material adverse effect on the
assets, business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company
Entities, taken as a whole, unless such Effect or Effects has or have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(h) For purposes of this Section 5.02, (i) the term "Person" means any Person
or "group," as used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with
respect to Parent, Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (ii) references to
the "Company Board" shall mean the Company Board or, to the extent applicable,
an authorized committee thereof.

Section 5.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, (x) provide Parent
and its Representatives reasonable access (at Parent's sole cost and expense),
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice,
during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01,
to the Company Entities' properties, books and records, Contracts, and
personnel, in each case for any reasonable business purpose (including
transition and integration planning) related to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) furnish as promptly as
practicable to Parent all information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties, Contracts and personnel as Parent may reasonably request
(including information for the purpose of transition and integration
planning); provided, however, that: (i) any such access shall be conducted at
Parent's expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate
personnel of the applicable Company Entity and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company Entities; (ii) the Company may withhold from Parent or its
Representatives any document or information (A) that the Company reasonably
believes, after consultation with outside counsel, is subject to the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with a third party or a Contract restricting such
access (provided, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the third party or implement appropriate
procedures to enable the disclosure of such information), (B) is subject to
any attorney-client or other legal privilege (provided, that the Company, upon
the written request of Parent, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to allow the disclosure of such document or information (or as much of it as
possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client or
other legal privilege), (C) is commercially sensitive (as determined in the
Company's reasonable discretion) or (D) the access to which by Parent or its
Representatives would violate any applicable Law (provided, that the Company,
upon the reasonable written request of Parent, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner
that does not violate applicable Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide
any access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.03 to
the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation
where the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. No
investigation or access permitted pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by the Company hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01,
except as may be required by Law, each Party shall (and shall cause its
Representatives to) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in planning the
restructuring and integration of the Company Entities and their respective
businesses, on the one hand, with Parent and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses, on the other hand.



47

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries, and shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, prior to the Effective Time, use
any Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
obtained pursuant to this Section 5.03 for any competitive or other purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Merger.

(c) All documents and information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.03
shall be subject to the letter agreement, dated as of July 9, 2018, between
the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), as if each of Parent
and Merger Sub were subject to the obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties hereby
agree and acknowledge that the standstill and similar restrictions in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply upon the execution and delivery of
this Agreement to the extent required to permit any action contemplated hereby
and in accordance herewith and solely until any valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.04 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation and in consultation with
Parent) shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to
be mailed to the Company Stockholders relating to the Company Stockholders
Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy
Statement") in preliminary form. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish
all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement (or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement) to the Company and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by the Company or the Company's outside legal counsel in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement.

(b) If, prior to the expiration of the ten (10) day waiting period provided in
Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act, the Company does not receive either (1)
comments from the SEC on the preliminary Proxy Statement or (2) notice from
the SEC that it will review the preliminary Proxy Statement, then the Company
shall file definitive proxy materials (including the definitive Proxy
Statement) with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company Stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event
later than seven (7) Business Days) after the expiration of such waiting
period. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties shall promptly
notify each other after the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to, or any request from the SEC or any
other Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy
Statement and shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence
between it and its Affiliates and Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or any other government officials, on the other hand. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. If
the Company receives either (1) comments from the SEC on the preliminary Proxy
Statement or (2) notice from the SEC that it will review the preliminary Proxy
Statement, then, in either

case, (A) each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
(i) to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comment from the
SEC with respect to, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements
to, the Proxy Statement and (ii) to have the SEC advise the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable that the SEC has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement and (B) the Company shall file the Proxy Statement in
definitive form with the SEC and cause such definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (and
in no event later than seven (7) Business Days) after the SEC advises the
Company that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Unless
the Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 5.02, the Company shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement filed in preliminary form and in the
Proxy Statement filed in definitive form.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to filing the
preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC, responding to any comment from the
SEC with respect to, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements
to, the Proxy Statement or mailing the Proxy Statement in definitive form to
Company Stockholders, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company
shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and consider in good faith and incorporate Parent's
reasonable comments thereon.

(d) If, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to Parent
or any Affiliate of Parent or any Company Entity, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, that is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of
such event or change, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and, as required by
applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Company Stockholders. Nothing in this Section 5.04(d)
shall limit the obligations of any Party under Section 5.04(a).

(e) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.01, the Company, in reasonable consultation with Parent, shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any comments of the

of Parent; provided that, if at any time following the dissemination of the
Proxy Statement, either the Company or Parent reasonably determines in good
faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, including due to the absence of a quorum, then
on no more than two (2) occasions (for each of the Company and Parent) and
prior to the vote by the Company Stockholders contemplated by the Proxy

adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting for the

waiting period, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing,
prohibiting or restricting consummation of the Closing or impeding,

applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. The Company and Parent agree that the initial joint press
release to be issued with respect to this Agreement shall be in a form agreed
to by the Parties. Nothing in this Section 5.08 shall limit the ability of any
Party to make internal announcements to its respective employees that are
consistent in all material respects with the prior public disclosures
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

* * *



shall not permit any such indemnification, advancement of expenses or

substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors,
officers, employees and agents who are currently covered by the directors' and
officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one (1) policy year more than three
hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by
the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount") and, if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required

the Effective Time



55

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

that in no event shall the cost of any such tail insurance in respect of any
one (1) policy year exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent shall cause the

continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, all of
which, are express third‑party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10 and (iii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise including under the Organizational Documents. Unless required by
applicable Law, this Section 5.10 may not be amended, altered or repealed in

case may be, that was provided to each such Continuing Company Personnel
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target incentive compensation
opportunities (including annual cash performance bonus), other than any
equity-based incentive opportunities, that are no less favorable than those in
effect with respect to each such Continuing Company Personnel immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance pay and benefits to any such
Continuing Company Personnel who incurs a "qualifying termination" at any time
during the one-year period following the Effective Time at levels that are no
less favorable than the levels of such severance pay and benefits as in effect
under the applicable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time (where, for such purpose, "qualifying termination" shall mean any
termination of employment that would have resulted in severance pay or
benefits under such Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law if such termination
had occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (iv) other
compensation and employee benefits (other than equity based opportunities and
benefits) which are no less favorable in the aggregate



56

compensation and employee benefits provided to such Continuing Company
Personnel immediately prior to the Effective Time.

of benefits, any waiting period and benefit accrual thereunder, service with
the Company and Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessor
entities, in each case, to the same extent such service was recognized under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service).

(d) With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that is a health or welfare benefit
plan which replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Continuing Company Personnel participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting condition
exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Continuing Company Personnel to the extent
waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Company Personnel participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) provide that Continuing Company Personnel will be immediately
eligible to participate in any such Post-Closing Plan, without any waiting
period, to the extent such Continuing Company Personnel was eligible to
participate in the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Company Personnel for any
applicable amounts paid or eligible expenses incurred (whether in the nature
of co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts applied toward deductibles or
other out-of-pocket expenses) by such Continuing Company Personnel (and his or
her covered dependents) under the terms of the Company Benefit Plan toward
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements
under the applicable Post-Closing Plan that replaces such Company Benefit Plan
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(e) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall establish an annual
incentive plan or plans for the remainder of the year in which the Effective
Time occurs, which annual incentive plans shall provide Continuing Company
Personnel with a bonus opportunity at least equal to that provided under the

Person attempts or purports to terminate, withdraw, repudiate or rescind the
Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination,
withdrawal, repudiation or rescission is valid);

(ii) Parent obtains Knowledge of any breach or default or any written
threatened breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without due notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing;

(iii) Parent receives any written communication from any Person with respect
to any (A) actual, potential or threatened breach, default, termination,
withdrawal, repudiation or rescission by any party to the Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing or (B)
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter
(other than customary negotiations);

(iv) Any Financing Party refuses to provide or expresses in writing an intent
to refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the

(v) Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms (including any "flex" provisions)
no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt
Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request
therefor), Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in Sections 5.15(c)(i)
through 5.15(c)(iv).

(e) Parent shall not amend, modify, supplement, replace or agree to any waiver
under the Commitment Letter (it being understood that the exercise of any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall be deemed not to be
an amendment, modification or waiver) without the prior written approval of
the Company if such amendment, modification, supplement, replacement or waiver
to be made to any provision of or remedy under the Commitment Letter would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) such that Parent would
not or does not have sufficient cash to make the payments necessary under this
Agreement, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Financing, or
(iii) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Commitment

(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, (B)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
Financing Parties or any other parties to the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (C) adversely impact the ability
of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that Parent may amend, supplement or modify the
Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities (or titles with respect to such
entities). In the event that new commitment letters or fee letters are entered
into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification of the Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this Section
5.15(e), Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a true, complete and
accurate copy thereof (and in the case of the Fee Letter, redacted in a manner
consistent with Section 4.07). For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Commitment Letter," "Debt Letters" and "Fee Letter" shall include and mean
such documents as amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced in
compliance with this Section 5.15(e), and references to "Financing" shall
include and mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced, as applicable.

(f) If the funds with respect to all or any portion of the Financing expire or
are terminated, withdrawn, repudiated or rescinded for any reason or otherwise
become unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter (other
than as a result of the Company's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth
in Section 6.02), Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) promptly
(and in any event, within two (2)



60

Business Days) notify the Company in writing thereof and the reasons therefor,
(ii) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in
any event no later than the Closing Date), use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, at its sole expense, substitute financing sufficient to
enable Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with its terms (the "Substitute Financing"); provided,
that (x) Parent shall not be required to arrange or obtain any Substitute
Financing having terms and conditions less favorable to Parent and its
Affiliates in any material respect (as reasonably determined by Parent) than
the terms and conditions (including "market flex" provisions) contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter delivered on the date hereof and (y)
any such Substitute Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), (B)
impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand,
amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the Financing or (C) otherwise
expand, amend or modify any provision of the Commitment Letter in a manner
that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (1) delay or make less
likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on or prior to Closing, (2) adversely impact the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against the Financing Parties or any other parties to
the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (3)
adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. If Substitute Financing is obtained,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a new commitment letter
(including any associated engagement letter and fee letter) that provides for
such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to
the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and
the related fee letters (in the case of the fee letters, redacted in a manner
consistent with Section 4.06. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and each commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed a "Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Commitment Letter.

(h) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
and their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or
incur any liability to any Person under, any financing that Parent may raise
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
cooperation provided pursuant to Section 5.16, other than such expenses or
matters subject to reimbursement or indemnity by the Company under this
Agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parent's,
Merger Sub's nor any of their respective Affiliates' obligations hereunder are
conditioned in any manner upon Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or any other
financing.

Company or (C) the Company has failed to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or

(ii) if the Company materially breaches any of its respective covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement, which breach (A)
would reasonably be expected to prevent the satisfaction of any condition set
forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) and (B) either (1) is not
reasonably capable of being cured by the Company by the End Date or (2) if
reasonably capable of being cured by the Company by the End Date, Parent has
delivered to the Company written notice of such breach and such breach is not
cured by the Company by the earlier of (x) the End Date and (y) the date that
is thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice; provided, however, that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.01(d)(ii) if Parent is then in material breach of any of its covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement, in each case,
such that any condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b), as
applicable, could not then be satisfied.

(e) Termination Procedure. This Agreement may be terminated only pursuant to
Sections 7.01(a) through 7.01(d). Termination of this Agreement shall not
require the approval of the Company Stockholders. In order to terminate this
Agreement, the Party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written
notice of such termination to the other Parties in accordance with Section
8.02, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

Section 7.02 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated as
provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Company
or Parent (or any stockholder, Affiliate or Representative thereof), whether
arising before or after such termination, based on, arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter
of this Agreement (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at
law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity), except for (a)
Section 5.09, Section 5.16(c), this Section 7.02, Section 7.03, and Article
VIII, which provisions shall survive such termination, and (b) the liability
of any Party (whether or not the terminating Party) for any fraud or
Intentional Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, which
liabilities shall survive the termination of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Intentional Breach" means a material breach of this Agreement
that is a consequence of an act or omission by the breaching Party with the
knowledge or intent that the taking of, or the omission of taking, such act
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material
breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing to the contrary, the agreements of the parties contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
(in the case of the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the terms thereof).

Section 7.03 Termination Fees.

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by:

(i) The Company pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i);

(ii) Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i);

(iii) Parent, if (A) after the execution of this Agreement and prior to such
termination, a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed
(whether by the Company or a third party) or otherwise made known to the
Company Board and not withdrawn (publicly, if publicly disclosed), (B) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 7.01(d)(ii) due to a breach
of, or a failure to perform or comply with, one or more covenants or
agreements of the Company under this Agreement following the making of such
Company Takeover Proposal, and (C) within twelve (12) months following the
date of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its
stockholders a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Takeover Proposal shall
have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this Section 7.03(a)(iv),
the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

(iv) Either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and in any
such case of this Section 7.03(a)(iv), (A) after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to such termination, a Company Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed (whether by the Company or a third party) or
otherwise made known to the Company Board and not withdrawn (publicly, if
publicly disclosed) and (B) within twelve (12) months following the date of
such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered
into a definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders
a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
consummated (provided that for purposes of this Section 7.03(a)(iv), the
references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)"); or

(v) Either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) and in any
such case of this Section 7.03(a)(v), (A) after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to such termination, a Company Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed (whether by the Company or a third party) or
otherwise made known to the Company Board and not withdrawn (publicly, if
publicly disclosed) and (B) within twelve (12) months following the date of
such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered
into a definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders
a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
consummated (provided that for purposes of this Section 7.03(a)(v), the
references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $128,855,000
in cash (the "Company Termination Fee").

(b) All payments under this Section 7.03 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, (i)
in the case of Section 7.03(a)(i) above, immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination, (ii) in the case of Section 7.03(a)(ii)
above, promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
date of such termination, and (iii) in the case of Section 7.03(a)(iii),
Section 7.03(a)(iv), or Section 7.03(a)(v)

above, on the earlier to occur of (x) the date of entry of a definitive
agreement and (y) the date on which a Company Takeover Proposal is
consummated.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, without such provisions, the
Parties would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth
in this Section 7.03 or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay or cause to
be paid to Parent its reasonable, documented out‑of‑pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate published by The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted
by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that:

(i) If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company
is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under Section 7.03(a), upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further
liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, and payment of the Company Termination Fee and such costs and
expenses by the Company shall be Parent's sole and exclusive remedy for any
Claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent, Parent's Subsidiaries and any
other Person in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (and the termination thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have, and each
expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse
(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in equity); and

(ii) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one (1) occasion.



72

829649.04-LACSR01A - MSW

(d) Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that the payment of the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty
but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall compensate
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in the circumstances in
which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

Section 8.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights under this
Section 8.03 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect

fulfilled to the extent possible.

Parties.

Section 8.05 Entire Agreement; No Third‑Party Beneficiaries.

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Disclosure Letters) and the
documents and instruments and other agreements, in each case, among the
Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein, the Confidentiality

benefit of, and may be relied upon and shall be enforceable by, the Financing
Parties; (iv) after the Effective Time, for Section 2.01 and Section 2.02,
each of which is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Company Stockholders as of immediately prior to Effective
Time, which holders are express third‑party beneficiaries of Section 2.01 and
Section 2.02 from and after the Effective Time; and (v) after the Effective
Time, for Section 2.04, which is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the holders of Company Equity Awards as of immediately

their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (B) this

Sub may assign all or any portion of its rights or interests under this
Agreement for collateral security purposes to any Financing Party, any lender
and any other security holders (including agents or trustees thereof) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries without the consent of any other Party. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 8.06 shall be void. Subject
to the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

Section 8.07 Governing Law. Except as set forth in Section 8.11(b), this
Agreement, including all matters of construction, and all Claims or causes of

Section 8.08 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified and
supplemented in any and all respects any time prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any of the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that (a)
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no
amendment, modification or supplement that by applicable Law or in accordance
with the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable, without such further
approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law, (b) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time and (c) no amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of
Section 8.05(b)(iii), this Section 8.08(c), Section 8.09, Section 8.11(b),
Section 8.12, Section 8.14 or the definition of "Financing Parties" that is
adverse to the interests of any Financing Party shall be effective without the
prior written consent of each such adversely affected Financing Party. Any
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be effective only if it is
set forth in an instrument in writing executed by each Party.

Section 8.09 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the
conditions in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed by the Party against whom the waiver or extension is to be effective.
The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any extension or waiver of any provision
referred to in Section 8.08(c) that is adverse to the interests of any
Financing Party shall require the prior written consent of such Financing
Party.

Section 8.10 Specific Performance.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms (including a Party's failure to take such
actions as are required of such Party hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or were otherwise breached or threatened to be
breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including the right of a Party to cause each other Party to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any court
referred to in Section 8.11, without proof of actual damages (and each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or any
similar instrument in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

and unconditionally waives and agree not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such Claim brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each Party further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 8.02 shall be effective service of process for
any Claim brought against such Party in any such court. Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising from, under or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that all claims or causes of action (whether
at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and whether
now existing or hereafter arising) involving, directly or indirectly, any
Financing Party and arising from or in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Letters, the Financing or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby shall be raised to and exclusively determined by the
United States Federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York County, State of New York, each such court to whose
jurisdiction and venue the Parties unconditionally consent and submit, and
each Party hereby, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any such claim in such court and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such claim brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum and (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Commitment
Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and whether now existing or hereafter arising)

this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Letters, the
Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
shall be

exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of New York.

Section 8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND
ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING) WHICH MAY ARISE FROM, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATE
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION INVOLVING THE DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR ANY
FINANCING PARTY) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT LETTERS OR THE FINANCING OR
ANY OTHER SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
ANY FINANCING PARTY). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.12.

Section 8.13 Construction. Each Party has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

Section 8.01 No Recourse to Financing Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Company, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its
and its Affiliates' respective former, current or future equityholders,
partners, controlling persons, members, managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors and their respective
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Company Parties") hereby (a)
acknowledges that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to
any Company Party under this Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Financing or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reasons of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including, but not limited to, any dispute
related to, or arising from, the Debt Letters, the Financing or any
performance

thereunder, (b) waives any rights, claims or causes of action against any of
the Financing Parties and their respective current, former or future
directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or representatives (in
each case, in such capacity), in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including all
claims or causes of action (whether at law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise and whether now existing or hereafter arising), and
(c) agrees not to commence (and if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise
terminate, and not to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing,
the Debt Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether
at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and whether
now existing or hereafter arising). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
will not limit the rights of the parties to the Commitment Letter to enforce
the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms.
