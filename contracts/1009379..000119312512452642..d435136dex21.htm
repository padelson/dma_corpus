iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of November
3, 2012, by and among HUMANA INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), MINER
ACQUISITION SUBSIDIARY, INC., a Florida corporation and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), and METROPOLITAN HEALTH NETWORKS,
INC., a Florida corporation (the "Company").

_WHEREAS_ , on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company with
the Company surviving the Merger, pursuant to which each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except for shares of Company Common Stock to be converted
pursuant to _Section 1.02(b)_;

_WHEREAS_ , the Company Board has adopted and approved this Agreement and
resolved that this Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Florida Law, be recommended and submitted to the Companys
shareholders as being in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders.

 

 _WHEREAS_ , the board of directors of Merger Subsidiary has adopted and
approved this Agreement and resolved that this Agreement and the Merger, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Florida Law, be recommended and
submitted to Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Subsidiary, as being in
the best interests of Merger Subsidiary and Parent; and

_WHEREAS_ , the Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Subsidiary, has
adopted and approved this Agreement and approved the Merger; and

_WHEREAS_ , certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the
meanings set forth in _Section 11.01_.

_NOW, THEREFORE_ , in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with
and into the Company in accordance with Florida Law, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Article 8_ , the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004, as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than three Business Days after the date
the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
(the "Closing Date").

(c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida, in such

 



1  form and with such provisions as are required by, and executed in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of Florida Law. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Articles of Merger are
duly filed with the Department of State of the State of Florida (or at such
later time as permitted by Florida Law as Parent and the Company shall agree
and shall be specified in the Articles of Merger), which Effective Time shall
be the effective date of the Merger contemplated by Section 607.1101(3)(b) of
Florida Law.

 

(d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of Florida Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all title to the real estate and other property, or
any interest therein, and be subject to all of the obligations and
liabilities, of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under
Florida Law.

SECTION 1.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.02(b)_, each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into and become the right to receive $11.25 in cash,
without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"); as of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each such certificate,
a "Certificate") and each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an
"Uncertificated Share") which immediately prior to the Effective Time was
registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
each share of Common Stock represented thereby;

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be converted into and become the right to receive
$0.0001 in cash without interest; as of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate and Uncertificated
Share which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to the
Company, any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or owned by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries on the stock
transfer books of the Company, shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the $0.0001 in cash for each share of Common Stock represented
thereby; and

 

(c) each share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of Merger Subsidiary
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.03. _Surrender and Payment._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration to the holders of
Company Common Stock entitled thereto and shall enter into a Paying Agent
agreement that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company with the Paying
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit (from and after the
Effective Time) of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled
thereto, for payment in accordance with this _Section 1.03_ through the
Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. All
cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 1.03(a)_ shall
herewith be referred to as the "Payment Fund." Promptly after the Effective
Time (and in any event within two Business Days following the

 



2  Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send,
to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)_, a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for
use in such payment.

 

(b) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund as directed by
Parent; __provided__ , __however__ , that no investment losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive such consideration; __provided__ , __further__ ,
__however__ , that to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration,
Parent shall promptly cause to be deposited additional funds with the Paying
Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such Merger Consideration up to the amount of such losses. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of, and paid to, Parent upon termination of the Payment Fund.

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.02(a)_ shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent
of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock represented by
a Certificate or each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate (and the share(s) of
Company Common Stock represented thereby) or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration.

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.
Until surrendered or transferred in accordance with this _Section 1.03_, each
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration provided in _Section 1.02(a)_ or the applicable consideration
provided in _Section 1.02(b)_, as the case may be. The applicable Merger
Consideration provided in _Section 1.02(a)_ or the applicable consideration
provided in _Section 1.02(b)_, as the case may be, paid upon surrender of any
Certificate or the transfer of any Uncertificated Share shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or any share(s) of the Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
1.03(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or
otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such holder who has not
surrendered Certificate(s) or transferred Uncertificated Share(s) for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this  _Section 1.03_ prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, in respect of such Certificate(s) (and the share(s) of Company
Common Stock represented thereby) or Uncertificated Share(s) without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable

 



3  abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, _Section 1.05_ (and not this _Section 1.03_)
shall govern the treatment of each share of Company Restricted Stock (as
defined below).

SECTION 1.04. _No Appraisal Rights_. The parties understand and agree that,
subject to the accuracy of the representations of Parent contained in _Section
4.08_ of this Agreement and assuming that neither Parent nor the Merger
Subsidiary has breached any of the covenants contained in _Section 6.03_ of
this Agreement, appraisal rights pursuant to Sections 607.1301 through
607.1333 of Florida Law or otherwise will not be available to the Companys
shareholders in connection with the Merger and no Company shareholder will be
entitled to receive appraisal rights.

SECTION 1.05. _Outstanding Equity Awards_.

 

(a) __Stock Plan__. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
reasonable actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or
resolutions of the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") or
a committee thereof and amending the Stock Plan) to terminate the Stock Plan
without any further liability on the part of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries and to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 1.05_.

(b) __Options__. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof) to provide that
prior to the Effective Time each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or
not then exercisable or vested, shall become fully vested and exercisable and
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (x) the
Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of such Company
Stock Option, without interest and less any applicable taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment (the "Option Consideration"). As used
herein, the term "Company Stock Option" shall mean any outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Stock Plan. In
addition, the Company shall take all necessary actions (including obtaining
any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the compensation committee
of the Company Board) to determine that the "Change in Control Price" as
defined in the Stock Plan shall be the Merger Consideration.

(c) _Restricted Stock_. Each outstanding share of restricted Company Common
Stock granted pursuant to the Stock Plan ("Company Restricted Stock") shall
immediately prior to the Effective Time become fully vested and, at the
Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all Company Restricted Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 

(d) _Cash Settlement through Payroll_. Subject to _Section 1.07_, the Company
shall pay, through its payroll system, to each holder of Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock, the cash payments provided for pursuant
to this _Section 1.05_ as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time. Parent agrees to make available to the Surviving Corporation, for the
benefit (from and after the Effective Time) of the holders of Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock, cash sufficient to pay the cash payments
provided for pursuant to this _Section 1.05_ within the time required by
this _Section 1.05_.

SECTION 1.06. _Adjustments._

 

(a) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
occur, as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization,

 



4  stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any
stock dividend or distribution thereon with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the
effect of such event on the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 1.06(a)_ shall be construed to limit any
restrictions that may arise under other provisions of this Agreement on
actions of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would cause such an
adjustment.

 

SECTION 1.07. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law, and if any such amounts are
deducted and withheld, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, as the case may be, timely pay such amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Authority. If the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction
and withholding.

SECTION 1.08.  _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct (or in such
customary amount as the Paying Agent may direct in accordance with its
standard procedures), as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of each share of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article 1_.

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 

(a) The Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective Affiliates and Representatives to promptly request any such
Person or Persons (other than Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their
Representatives) with whom there have been any such discussions, activities or
negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal at any time to promptly return
or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement

Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct the Companys and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate, or knowingly encourage, the making, submission or
public announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to constitute, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations or otherwise

entitled to notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this
_Section 5.02_, (iii) enter into any written letter of intent, agreement,

other than disclosure of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement).

 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing after the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
received any request for discussions or negotiations, or any request for
access to the properties or books and records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives is or has become aware, or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry, offer or
request relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal or
request and the material terms and conditions of such proposal, if any.
Following the date hereof, the Company shall promptly advise Parent (and in
any event within 24 hours) of any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal (whether made before or after
the date hereof) or any material change to the financial or other terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by or otherwise set forth in this  _Section
5.02_, the Company Board shall not (i)(A) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (C) adopt,

shareholders of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal or (D) enter into any
agreement, contract or agreement in principle requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or breach its obligations under this

 



29  Agreement (such actions prohibited by this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 5.02_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval:

(i) if (A) the Company receives a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal
which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor and outside nationally recognized
legal counsel (which may be the Companys current outside legal counsel), is
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) the
Company has not breached in any material respect _Section 5.02(a)_, the
Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to
the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement having provisions as to confidential
treatment of information that are substantially similar to the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (and does not omit restrictive
provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement);  _ _provided__ ,
__however__ , that the Company shall as promptly as practicable provide to
Parent any nonpublic information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is provided to a third party given such access which was not previously
provided to Parent or its Representatives, and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the Third Party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal;
__provided__ , __however__ , that the Company shall as promptly as
practicable provide to Parent a copy of any Acquisition Proposal made to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

(ii) in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change but only if prior to taking any such
action:

 

(1) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor and outside nationally recognized
legal counsel (which may be the Companys current outside legal counsel), that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
adjustment or revisions offered by Parent and intended to be binding on
Parent and Merger Subsidiary in response to such Acquisition Proposal
(including pursuant to clause (3) below));

(2) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (the
"Negotiation Period") and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of
such Superior Proposal and each of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements to be entered into by the Company with the Third Party making such
Superior Proposal; and

 

(3) during the Negotiation Period, the Company has negotiated in good faith
with Parent to the extent Parent notifies the Company that it wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, and either
(x) prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period, Parent shall not have
offered an amendment intended to be binding on Parent and Merger Subsidiary
to the terms of this Agreement, or (y) if Parent within such period shall have
offered an amendment intended to be binding on Parent and Merger Subsidiary to
the terms of this Agreement, the Company Board, after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor and outside nationally recognized
legal counsel (which may be the Companys current outside legal counsel),
shall have determined in good faith that the Third Partys Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal with respect to Parents revised
proposal; __provided__ , __however__ , that each time material modifications
to the material terms of an Acquisition Proposal determined to be a Superior
Proposal are made, the Negotiation Period shall be extended for two Business
Days after written notification of such change to Parent shall have been
provided (which notification shall include a copy or description of the
Superior Proposal with such material modifications); and

(4) the Company shall not have breached in any material respect this 
_Section 5.02_;

in which event, following the satisfaction of each of the foregoing clauses
(1) through (4), the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(g)_; __provided__ , __however__ , that prior to or concurrent
with such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal

 



30  and paid Parent the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement (to the extent
that Parent has at such time provided documentation for such Expense
Reimbursement; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , if Parent has not at such time
provided documentation for such Expense Reimbursement, the Company shall
promptly pay such Expense Reimbursement to Parent upon receiving such
documentation) pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 10.04(b)(v)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.02_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, other than in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, but
only if prior to taking any such action:

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside nationally recognized legal counsel (which may be the Companys
current outside legal counsel), that the failure of the Company Board to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law (taking into account any adjustment or revisions proposed by Parent
(including pursuant to clause (iii) below));

 

(ii) the Company Board has given Parent at least three Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify in detail the basis for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

 

(iii) during such three Business Day period, the Company has negotiated, in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent notifies the Company that it
wishes to negotiate), to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement
in such a manner that would enable the Company Board to determine in good
faith that, irrespective of the occurrence of the Intervening Event, the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; and

(iv) following such three Business Day period, the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its nationally recognized
financial advisor and outside nationally recognized legal counsel (which may
be the Companys current outside legal counsel), that the revisions to this
Agreement offered by Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii) would not
obviate the need for the Company Board, in accordance with the directors
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence of such Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act (so long as any
disclosure made or action taken is consistent with _Section 5.02)_, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
nationally recognized legal counsel (which may be the Companys current
outside legal counsel), that the failure of the Company Board to make such
disclosure consistent with _Section 5.02_ would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

SECTION 5.03. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to
Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon
reasonable notice and request, (i) give to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to its offices, properties,
books and records, (ii) furnish to Parent and its Representatives, such
financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct its Representatives to cooperate with
Parent and its Representatives in its investigation; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that all such notices or requests by Parent and its
Representatives shall be made directly to the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company or his designees. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.03_
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably

 



31  with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall, prior to the Effective Time,
require the Company to take any action that would, in the good faith judgment
of the Company, constitute a waiver of the attorney-client, work product or
similar privilege or trade secret protection held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality obligations owing to Third Parties;
__provided__ , __however__ , that the Company shall make a good faith effort
to accommodate any request from Parent and its Representatives for access or
information pursuant to this _Section 5.03_ in a manner that does not result
in such a waiver or violation (including by entering into joint defense or
similar agreements with respect thereto).

(b) All information furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.03_ shall be
subject to that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2011
between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). The parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to restrict Parent from engaging in discussions and negotiations or
making proposals as contemplated by  _Section 5.02(d)_ and _Section
5.02(e)_.

SECTION 5.04. _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company (and the Company shall give due
consideration to Parents advice) regarding the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its officers or
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereunder and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect
to the status of, and any material developments in, any such litigation. The
Company shall not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and
consideration and without Parents prior written consent (which such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned with respect to any
settlement of such litigation that solely involves a cash payment by the
Company); __provided__ , __however__ , that such consent shall not be required
with respect to any settlement of such litigation that solely involves a cash
payment by the Company if such cash payment is made by the Company using only
proceeds of one or more of its insurance policies (taking into account
applicable deductibles payable by the Company).

SECTION 5.05. _Real Estate Matters_. Parent, at its sole discretion and
expense, may order preliminary title reports from one or more nationally
recognized title companies (the "Title Companies") with respect to any of the
Company Owned Real Property (the Company Owned Real Property covered by such
reports being referred to herein as the "Titled Property"). The Company, at no
expense to the Company, shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
connection with Parents efforts to obtain title insurance policies pursuant
thereto, including, by providing customary affidavits and indemnities as are
required by the Title Companies and in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company for the deletion or modification of standard or printed exceptions
regarding construction liens, parties in possession and unrecorded title
matters so as to remove the "gap" in any title insurance policies issued
pursuant thereto, that are customarily deleted by virtue of a seller
delivering such instruments in commercial real estate transactions in the
state or province in which the Titled Property is located. Such cooperation
shall include providing Parent and the Title Companies copies of, with
respect to Titled Property, reasonably requested existing surveys, existing
title commitments and title insurance policies, to the extent the same are in
the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries and to the extent the same
are not publicly available. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall
have any obligation to cure any title matters.

SECTION 5.06. _D andO Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase prepaid six-year officers and directors "tail" liability policies
("DandO Insurance") on terms and conditions that are substantially similar to
the Companys existing officers and directors liability policies and
providing coverage benefits that are not materially more or less favorable to
the Indemnified Persons than the Companys current such policy; __provided__
, __however__ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance
exceed 350% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for
its existing officers and directors liability policy (the "Maximum
Amount"); __provided__ , __further__ , __however__ , that if the cost of the
DandO Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Company shall purchase as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. The DandO Insurance
shall be placed through Willis Group Holdings or its Affiliates. In addition,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent to 

 



32  enable Parent to purchase "tail" coverage for professional liability and
other similar insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
placed through such brokers and with such insurance carriers as may be
specified by Parent.

SECTION 5.07. _Rule 16b-3_. The Company shall, and shall be permitted to,
take all actions to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company, and who would
otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act.

SECTION 5.08. _Company Board of Directors_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall obtain the resignation of each of the officers and directors of the
Board of Directors of each of the Companys Subsidiaries effective upon the
Effective Time.

SECTION 5.09. _Series A Preferred Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Series A Preferred Stock to be cancelled (by way of
redemption, repurchase, conversion or other action of substantially similar
effect); __provided__ , __however__ , that the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, (a) pay more than an amount per share in cash
equal to the sum of (i) $105 per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus (ii)
all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, or (b) issue more than the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of the Series A Articles of
Amendment; __provided__ , __further__ , __however__ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Company shall be deemed to have redeemed all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock if, at least ten trading days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company provides notice of such redemption to the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A Holders") in accordance with
Article VI of the Companys bylaws, the Company complies with Section
607.0721 of Florida Law in connection with such redemption and a sum
sufficient to redeem such shares has been deposited with a bank, trust
company, or other financial institution upon an irrevocable obligation to pay
the Series A Holders the redemption price upon surrender of the shares and
(ii) in the event that any Series A Holder is unable to provide the Company
with a stock certificate or other satisfactory evidence of ownership of
any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, payment of the redemption price or
the repurchase price, as the case may be, for any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock held by such Series A Holder may be made upon receipt of an indemnity
bond in an amount per share and form satisfactory to the Company (which in no
event will be less than the amount to be received by such Series A Holder upon
redemption or repurchase in accordance with this _Section 5.09_). If and to
the extent cancellation of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock is made by
other action of substantially similar effect as repurchase or redemption, the
provisions of subsection (ii) of the proviso above, or other action of
substantially similar effect, shall apply if appropriate.

administrators, an "Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation
to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law;

be ultimately determined by final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this _Section 6.02(a)_), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and/or amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or
investigation in respect of or arising out of acts or omissions occurring or

the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee,
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law. In the event of any such action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any
such action;.

 

(b)(i) All rights in existence under the Companys and its Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification and exculpation of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses to them for acts

set forth on  _Section 6.02(b) of the Company Disclose Schedule_, in each
case, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms and shall not be modified or amended, in a manner
adverse to any Indemnified Person; in the case of clause (i), for a period of
six years from the Effective Time; it being understood that nothing in this
sentence shall require any amendment to the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any such indemnification agreement; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), that any such
elimination of liability or exculpation provisions shall be subject to any
limitations imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or the Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.02_.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.02_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any Applicable
Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger
and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Person.

 

SECTION 6.03. _Certain Prohibited Actions_. Prior to the Closing, neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly, (a) become the

made by Parent and Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Credit
Agreement; (ii) to the extent within their control, satisfy on a timely basis

Agreement of which Parent becomes aware. Without limiting Parents and
Merger Subsidiarys other obligations under this

 



34 _Section 6.04_, if a breach of the Credit Agreement occurs, Parent shall (A)
promptly notify the Company of such breach and (B) use commercially reasonable

replacement, reduction, supplement, or other modification of, or waive any of
its material rights under, the Credit Agreement, if such amendment,

under the Credit Agreement (or would add any material additional conditions
to the availability of such borrowings).

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

SECTION 7.01. _Proxy Statement; Company Shareholder Meeting_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no
event no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement"), to be sent to the
holders of Company Common Stock relating to the meeting of such holders to be
held for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the
"Company Shareholder Meeting"). The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form,
in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the 1934 Act, and
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent prior to
filing. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the SEC notifies the Company that the SEC has no further
comments to the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent and
its counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, which
such comments shall be given reasonable and good faith consideration by the
Company. The Company shall (i) notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement and (ii)
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Companys proposed response to any such comments from the SEC and its staff
(to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given by the
Company). The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice
of the time when the SEC has cleared the Proxy Statement for mailing. If at
any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, any information in the
Proxy Statement (other than information that is supplied in writing by Parent
or Merger Subsidiary, or their counsel, specifically for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement) is discovered by the Company to contain any misstatement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and the Company shall
promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminate
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the shareholders
of the Company.

 

(b) Parent shall supply, or cause to be supplied, any such information
relating to Parent and Merger Subsidiary required under the 1934 Act and SEC
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement requested in writing by the Company within two Business Days of its
receipt of such request.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, any information

Governmental Authority may assert under Section 7 of the Clayton Act or
similar US antitrust or competition laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the HSR Act that may be asserted by any Governmental

and commitments as may be reasonably requested by any Governmental
Authority, in sufficient time to allow the conditions to the Merger to be
satisfied on or before the End Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall require or obligate the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to: (i) in the event that an administrative or judicial
action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any
Governmental Authority or private party challenging the transactions

representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to any such investigation or legal proceeding and to be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to
any Governmental Authority that is substantive in nature in connection with
any such investigation or legal proceeding.

transactions contemplated hereby.

consultation with each other, in connection with all matters relating to the

any Governmental Authority or Third 

 



37  Party and shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their Representatives and any
Governmental Authority or Third Party. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority or Third
Party in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry that is
substantive in nature unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
unless the other party is requested by such Governmental Authority not to
attend or such attendance is prohibited by Applicable Law, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.

 

(c) Matters relating to the Proxy Statement shall be governed by _Section
7.01_ and not this _Section 7.03_. Matters relating to the HSR Act shall be

each other the opportunity for review and comment on any applicable materials,
before issuing any press release, making any other public statement or
scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release, make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation and opportunity to review and comment; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.04_ shall

letters shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal and interest as well as any prepayment premiums, make
whole amounts, penalties, breakage costs or similar obligations related to
such Company Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (and daily
accrual thereafter) (the "Payoff Amounts") and (ii) state that all liens and
all guarantees in connection therewith relating to the assets of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be, upon the payment of the Payoff
Amounts on the Closing Date, released and terminated; __provided__ ,
__however__ , in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 7.06(a)_,
other than in respect of obligations that customarily continue subsequent to
the satisfaction of amounts then outstanding under credit facilities on the
Closing Date (the payoff letters described in this sentence being referred to
as the "Payoff Letters"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver a copy of the Payoff Letters to Parent no less than two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take all other
reasonable actions requested by Parent to facilitate the termination of
commitments under the Company Credit Facilities, effective as of immediately
after the Effective Time, the repayment in full of all obligations then
outstanding thereunder (using funds provided by Parent) and the release of
all encumbrances and termination of all guarantees (other than customarily
continuing obligations thereunder) in connection therewith on the Closing
Date, effective as of immediately after the Effective Time (such termination,
repayment and release, the "Credit Facility Termination"); __provided__ ,
__however__ , that in no event shall this _Section 7.06_ require 

 



38  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payment or incur any
monetary obligation or liability in connection with such Credit Agreement
Termination or cause such Credit Agreement Termination unless the Closing
shall have occurred and the Company shall have received funds to pay in full
the Payoff Amounts from Parent, except as provided in _Section 7.06(c)_. In
addition, to the extent Parent requests, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain payoff letters in customary form for
and with respect to any other indebtedness for borrowed money to be paid at
Closing not covered by the foregoing.

 

(b) _Section 7.06(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ contains a correct
and complete list of all outstanding letters of credit issued by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, indicating which of these letters of credit are
reserved under the revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit
Facility. The Company shall cooperate with Parent to provide that
these letters of credit, which are reserved under such revolving credit
facility, are either terminated at the Effective Time or become reserved under
Parents Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2011.

 

(c) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall contribute capital
to the Surviving Corporation and/or loan or advance to the Surviving
Corporation an amount of funds sufficient to repay the Payoff Amounts as set
forth in the Payoff Letters, net of any cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries available for such purpose, as contemplated by _Section
7.06(a)_. 

SECTION 7.07. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other lawful actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

Governmental Authority received by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of such party contained
in this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a failure of the closing condition set
forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.03(a)_, as the case may be;

(c) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a failure of the closing
condition set forth in  _Section 8.02(b)_ or _Section 8.03(b)_, as the case
may be; and

(d) any change, effect, development or event that has or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on such party;

__provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 7.08_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

 

SECTION 7.09. _Anti-Takeover Statute_. If any Anti-Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), each of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub
and their respective Board of Directors shall grant all such approvals and
take all such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
