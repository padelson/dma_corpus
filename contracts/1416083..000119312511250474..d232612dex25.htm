WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements and

and subject to adjustment as set forth in Schedule A and Article II.

ARTICLE II

the third business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article III (other
than (i) delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and (ii)
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver) of
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being
understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the
delivery of such items and the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver) of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed between Purchaser and Seller;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall be
permitted to delay the Closing to no later than the later of (A) thirty days
following the delivery of the 2010 Audited Financial Statements or (B)
October 3, 2011. The date on which the Closing takes place is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be deemed to be
effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date (the "
_Effective Time_ "); _provided_ that, with respect to determining Closing
Working Capital and Closing Net Funded Indebtedness, the Closing in each legal
jurisdiction shall be deemed to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing
Date in such jurisdiction and after giving effect to the Restructuring.

(b) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser:

(i) a certificate or certificates representing the Shares duly endorsed by
Seller for transfer to Purchaser (or accompanied by duly executed stock
powers) with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed;

(ii) a counterpart of the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by an authorized
officer of Seller; and

 



2 (iii) the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

least two business days prior to the Closing Date, immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the Adjusted Purchase Price (as defined in
Schedule A) (A) (1) _plus_ or _minus_ the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment, and (2) _minus_ the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness (the
Adjusted Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.01(c)(i)(A)
shall be hereinafter referred to as the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ") and
(B) _minus_ the Escrow Amount;

 

(ii) a counterpart of the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by an authorized
officer of Purchaser and the Escrow Agent; and 

(iii) the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.02(a).

 

(d) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit $25,000,000 in immediately
available funds (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") in an account (the " _Escrow
Account_ ") to be established with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), and to be held pursuant to the terms of an agreement
among Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The amount from time to time held by
the Escrow Agent pursuant thereto shall be invested and distributed as
provided by the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

SECTION 2.02. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) Within 60 days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement (the " _Statement_ ") setting forth (i) Working Capital as of the
Effective Time (" _Closing Working Capital_ ") and (ii) Net Funded
Indebtedness as of the Effective Time (" _Closing Net Funded Indebtedness_
"), each determined in a manner consistent and in accordance with the Purchase
Price Adjustment Principles.

(b) During the 60-day period following Sellers receipt of the Statement,
Seller and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review any working
papers of Purchaser and its independent auditors relating to the Statement;
_provided_ that Seller and its advisors, including its independent auditors,
shall have executed any release letters reasonably requested by Purchasers
independent auditors in connection therewith. The Statement shall become
final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the 60th day following delivery
thereof, unless Seller gives written notice to Purchaser of its disagreement
with the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to such date. Any
Notice of Disagreement shall be signed by an authorized officer of Seller and
shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
asserted and (ii) specify the amount that Seller reasonably believes is
the correct amount of the Closing Working Capital or the Closing Net Funded
Indebtedness, as applicable, based on the disagreements set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement, including a reasonably detailed description of the
adjustments applied to the Statement in calculating such amount, and

 



3  Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other amounts contained in
the Statement. If the Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser in a
timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this Section
2.02) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier
of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing all differences they
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or
(B) the date all disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting Firm. During the 15-day period following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they have with respect to the matters specified
in the Notice of Disagreement and agree on a final and binding determination
of Closing Working Capital and Closing Net Funded Indebtedness, as applicable,
which amount of Closing Working Capital shall not be less than the amount
thereof shown in Purchasers calculation delivered in the Statement nor more
than the amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation in the Notice of
Disagreement, and which amount of Closing Net Funded Indebtedness shall not
be more than the amount thereof shown in Purchasers calculation delivered in
the Statement nor less than the amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation
in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Purchaser and its
independent auditors shall be permitted to review the working papers of Seller
and its independent auditors relating to the Notice of Disagreement;
_provided_ that Purchaser and its advisors, including its independent
auditors, shall have executed any release letters reasonably requested by
Sellers independent auditors in connection therewith. At the end of such
15-day period, if no agreement on Closing Working Capital or Closing Net
Funded Indebtedness, as applicable, has been reached, Seller and Purchaser
shall submit in writing their positions with respect to any and all matters
that remain in dispute and that were properly included in the Notice of
Disagreement to an internationally recognized independent accounting firm
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution of any and all such matters. The
Accounting Firm shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if such firm is unable
or unwilling to act, such other internationally recognized independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser in writing or,
if the parties are unable to so agree in writing within 10 days after the end
of such 15-day period, then Seller and Purchaser shall each select such a
firm and such firms shall jointly select a third internationally recognized
independent public accounting firm to resolve the disputed matters. Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm that it (1) shall act as
an expert and not as an arbitrator, (2) shall review only the matters that
were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in
dispute, (3) shall make its determination in accordance with the requirements
of this Section 2.02 and based solely on the written submissions of Seller and
Purchaser and their respective independent auditors and not by independent
review, (4) shall not assign a value for any item that remains in dispute
that is greater than the greatest value, or smaller than the smallest value,
set forth by either Seller or Purchaser in their written submissions to the
Accounting Firm and (5) shall render its written decision as promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after submission to the
Accounting Firm of all matters in dispute. Such written decision shall be
final and binding on Seller and Purchaser. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The Accounting
Firms determination shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Accounting
Firm that it

 



4  reached its decision in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.02(b). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
2.02(b) shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations also shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted. The fees, costs and expenses of Purchaser incurred in connection
with its preparation of the Statement, its review of any Notice of
Disagreement and its preparation of any written submissions to the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Purchaser, and the fees, costs and expenses
of Seller incurred in connection with its review of the Statement, its
preparation of any Notice of Disagreement and its preparation of any written
submissions to the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller.

(c) The Adjusted Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the amount by which
Closing Working Capital exceeds $19,853,000 (the " _Target Working Capital_
") or decreased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than
the Target Working Capital and (ii) decreased by the amount of Closing Net
Funded Indebtedness. The Adjusted Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.02(c) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Final Purchase
Price_ ". If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase
Price, Purchaser shall, and if the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall, within 10 business days after the
Statement becomes final and binding on Seller and Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.02(b), make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds
of the amount of such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate
equal to the Prime Rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (but not
including) the date of payment.

 

(d) The term " _Working Capital_ " means Current Assets minus Current
Liabilities. The terms " _Current Assets_ ", " _Current Liabilities_ " and "
_Purchase Price Adjustment Principles_ " each have the respective meanings set
forth in Section 2.02 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) Any determinations by the Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses
performed by the Accounting Firm in connection with its resolution of any
dispute under this Section 2.02 shall not be admissible in evidence in any
Proceeding between Seller and Purchaser, other than to the extent necessary to
enforce payment obligations under Section 2.02(c). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Accounting Firm is not authorized or
permitted to make any determination as to the accuracy of Section 4.05 or any
other representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by
Seller with any of its covenants in this Agreement (other than in this
Section 2.02).

(f) Until the date on which the Statement shall become final and binding on
the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(b), Purchaser agrees that, following the
Closing, it shall preserve the accounting Records of the Business on which the
Statement is to be based and shall not take any actions with respect to such
Records that would obstruct, prevent or otherwise affect the procedures or the
results of the procedures set forth in this Section 2.02 (including the amount
of Closing Working Capital, Closing Net Funded 

 



5  Indebtedness or any amount included in the Target Working Capital, Estimated
Net Funded Indebtedness or the Statement or the preparation of the Statement).

 

(g) Until the date on which the Statement shall become final and binding on
the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(b), each party agrees that, following
the Closing, it shall afford and cause to be afforded to the other party and
any accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained by other party in
connection with the preparation of the Statement, any Notice of Disagreement
and any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2.02,
access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to the properties,
books, contracts, personnel and Records of the Business in the possession
of such party and (subject to the execution of customary access letters
acceptable to such partys accountant) the work papers of its accountant
relevant to the preparation of the Statement, any Notice of Disagreement and
the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.02 and shall provide the other
party, upon such other partys reasonable request and at such other partys
expense, with copies of any such books, contracts, Records and, to the extent
permitted by its applicable accountants, work papers.

the Acquisition, the Restructuring and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and compliance by Seller and its Subsidiaries (to the
extent applicable) with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, result in any breach, violation or

 



9  infringement of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, require consent, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation, amendment, modification or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a benefit or right under, or result in the creation of any mortgages,
liens, security interests, charges, options, title defects, easements,
encroachments, leases, subleases, licenses, deeds of trust, pledges or other

arising from acts of Purchaser or its Affiliates) upon any of the properties,
rights or assets of the Business under, any provision of (i) the Governing
Documents of Seller, (ii) any Material Contract or (iii) any Injunction or,
subject to the matters referred to in paragraph (b) below, applicable Law,

Business, (v) compliance with and filings or notices required by the rules and
regulations of any applicable securities exchange and (vi) such other Consents

material respects with, and is not in any material respect in breach, default
or violation of, any term, condition or provision of its Governing Documents.

SECTION 4.03. _Shares._ (a) Seller has good and valid title to the Shares free
and clear of any Liens, and is the record and beneficial owner thereof.
Assuming Purchaser has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful
owner of the Shares, upon delivery to Purchaser at the Closing of certificates
representing the Shares, duly endorsed by Seller for transfer to Purchaser

the date hereof.

"). 

(b) Section 4.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and

(c) The Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, has good, valid and
marketable fee title to all Owned Property, and the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, as applicable, has good and valid title to the leasehold estates

and enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement, to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

principles of equity and the discretion of courts in granting equitable
remedies). No written notice has been received by Seller, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary alleging that it is in breach or default in any material
respect under any Lease, except to the extent that any such breach or
default, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Seller, no

as applicable) is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice,
or both) in breach or default in any material respect thereunder, except to
the extent that such breach or default, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

material respect. Section 4.09(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth

Intellectual Property or Technology used by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in the conduct of the Business, except for claims that have
been satisfactorily resolved. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and

for the use of such Intellectual Property or Technology in the conduct of the
Business, except for non-exclusive license agreements relating to computer

conduct of the Business as presently conducted does not Infringe the Patents
of Aptuit Laurus Private Limited, except in the case of clauses (A) and (B)
for such violations, conflicts or infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect, and (ii) to the knowledge of Seller, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company Intellectual Property and Technology is not being
Infringed, except to the extent that any such Infringement, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in a Seller Material

Permit held by the Company or a Company Subsidiary and used in the operation
or conduct of the Business as presently conducted, except, in each case, for
any such invalidity or noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.
Since January 1, 2009, none of Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has received written notice of any Proceeding relating to the revocation or
modification of any Permit, the loss of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect.

the Company Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable Laws in relation to
access and benefits under the U.K. Company Benefit Plans, (ii) the Company

Employee or former employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has
been transferred to Seller or its subsidiaries by virtue of the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 with an entitlement
to benefits under such a scheme.

Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code. Except as
set forth in Section 4.13(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no U.S.
Company Benefit Plan provides post-employment welfare (including health,
medical or life insurance) benefits and neither Seller, the Company nor any of
their respective subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any such post-

Multiemployer Plan and any such plan, 

 



24  program, agreement, arrangement or understanding that is required by

is required by applicable Law) that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS to the
effect that such U.S. Company Benefit Plan and U.S. Employee Benefit Plan is
qualified and that the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from

Code, or an application for determination by the IRS that such U.S. Company
Benefit Plan and U.S. Employee Benefit Plan is qualified and that plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code has been timely filed and is
currently pending, and, to the knowledge of Seller, nothing has occurred,
whether by action or failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of such qualification.

(e) Neither Seller, the Company nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
contributes to, is required to contribute to or, in the past six years, has
contributed or been required to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan. Except
as set forth in Section 4.13(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of
Seller, the Company or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates participates
in a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA with respect to any current or former employee who provides or provided
services primarily to the segment of the Business operated in the United

is required by applicable Law) that is required to be registered with the
applicable Governmental Entity is registered with such Governmental Entity

failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
registration, (ii) all Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plans (excluding any
Multiemployer Plan and any such plan, program, agreement, arrangement or
understanding that is required by applicable Law) that are required by
applicable Law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan to be
funded are funded to the extent so required and (iii) with respect to all
other Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plans (excluding any Multiemployer Plan and any
such plan, program, agreement, arrangement or understanding that is required
by applicable Law) that are not required by applicable Law or by the terms of
such Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan to be funded, adequate reserves therefor
have been established on the accounting statements of the Company or one of
the Company Subsidiaries to the extent required by GAAP, consistently applied.

(g) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to result in any material Liability to Purchaser or the
Business, no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to subject the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, either directly or by reason of its
affiliation with any member of its ERISA Affiliates, to any Tax, fine, Lien,
penalty or other material Liability under ERISA, the Code or other applicable
Laws.

 



25 (h) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to result in any material Liability to Purchaser or the
Business, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (excluding any

understanding that is required by applicable Law) and Employee Benefit Plan

the execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any subsequent event(s)) could
(i) result in severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date of this Agreement or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans or
Employee Benefit Plans. No Company Benefit Plan or Employee Benefit Plan
exists that as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in action with any
subsequent event(s)), could result in payments which would not be deductible
under Section 280G of the Code.

of this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents to which it is a party
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly and properly taken.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and,
prior to Closing, Purchaser will have duly executed and delivered each Other

been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Seller, this
Agreement constitutes, and, upon the due authorization, execution and
delivery of the Other Transaction Documents by Seller of the Other Transaction

moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally, general
principles of equity and the discretion of courts in granting equitable
remedies).

SECTION 6.02. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Purchaser do not, the execution and delivery by Purchaser of
each Other Transaction Document to which it is a party will not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
compliance by Purchaser with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof will
not, conflict with, result in any breach, violation or infringement of, or
constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, require consent, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
amendment, modification or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the
properties, rights or assets of Purchaser under, any provision of (i) the
Governing Documents of Purchaser, (ii) any Contract to which Purchaser is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, or
(iii) any Injunction or, subject to the matters referred to in paragraph (b)
below, applicable Law, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No Consent of, Filing with, or notification to, any Governmental
Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Purchaser in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the consummation of the

or thereby or the compliance by Purchaser with the terms and conditions hereof
and thereof, other than (i) compliance with and Consents and Filings under the
HSR Act, (ii) Consents of, and Filings with, any Governmental Entity that are

with and Filings or notices required by the rules and regulations of any
applicable securities exchange and (v) such other Consents the absence of

Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.03. _Proceedings._ There are no (a) outstanding Injunctions of any
Governmental Entity or arbitration tribunal against Purchaser, (b) Proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or (c) investigations by any Governmental Entity which
are pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser,
other than, in each case, any such items that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.04. _Securities Act._ The Shares are being acquired for investment
only and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any public
distribution thereof.

SECTION 6.05. _Financing Commitment; Availability of Funds._ Purchaser has
received and accepted the executed commitment letter dated August 19, 2011
(including any fee letters or other side letters with respect to fees, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the
" _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide the
full amount of the debt financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated thereby and to pay
all related fees and expenses. The debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_
". Purchaser has delivered to Seller true and complete copies of the executed
Debt Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that any fee or side letter may be
redacted to omit numerical fee amounts and other matters not related to
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the obligations of the
Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing). The only conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the obligations of the Lenders to
fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in

arrangements or understandings in connection with the Debt Financing other
than the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect, is a legal,

modified in any respect (and no such amendment, supplement or modification
thereto is contemplated as of the date hereof), and the financing commitments
thereunder have not been withdrawn or terminated. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred that would constitute a default (or an event which with or
without notice, lapse of times or both, would become a default) or breach on
the part of Purchaser under any term or condition of the Debt
Commitment Letter, and, as of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to
believe that any term or condition of closing in the Debt Commitment Letter
will not be timely satisfied, or that any portion of the Debt Financing to be
made thereunder will otherwise not be available to Purchaser to consummate
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby at the time
required pursuant to this Agreement. As of the date hereof, Purchaser has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt
Commitment Letter to be paid by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents and to pay
the related fees and expenses associated therewith.

conditions to Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties

express or implied, including any representation or warranty as to the
merchantability, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose of any of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case by Seller or its
Affiliates, or any of its or their Representatives, and (ii) the Company and
each Company Subsidiary on an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis; and

40 ARTICLE VII

_Covenants of Purchaser_

Purchaser covenants and agrees as follows: 

SECTION 7.01. _Confidentiality._ Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition, the Restructuring
and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Other Transaction Documents (including the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents) is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and an Affiliate of Seller dated
as of May 17, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which
are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing, the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Business;
_provided_ that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information
provided to it by or on behalf of Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or their respective Representatives concerning Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) and
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Other Transaction
Documents shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 7.01, the covenant set forth in this
Section 7.01 shall terminate five years after the Closing Date.

SECTION 7.02. _No Use of Certain Names; Transitional Trademark License; IP
License and Transfers._ (a) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to, promptly, (i) and in any
event within six months after the Closing Date, revise sales and product
literature and promotional materials in any media, purchase orders, invoices,
shipping documents, packaging and labeling and similar materials ("
_Collateral_ ") to delete all references to "Aptuit" and "Indigo"; _provided_
that, for a period of six months from the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Company
and each Company Subsidiary may continue to distribute Collateral and any
Inventory of the Business that uses any reference to "Aptuit" or "Indigo" to
the extent that such Collateral and Inventory of the Business exist on the
Closing Date or are manufactured within the 90-day period after the Closing
Date, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary for such six month period the limited right and a royalty-free paid
up license to so use Sellers trademarks, trade dress and other source
indicators owned by Seller (and covenants to cause each of its Affiliates to
grant Purchaser, the Company and each Company Subsidiary the limited right and
a royalty-free paid up license to so use such Affiliates trademarks, trade
dress and other source indicators owned by such Affiliate) that have
been used in connection with the manufacture, distribution, marketing and
sale of the Business products, to the extent necessary to allow Purchaser,
the Company and each Company Subsidiary to so use such Collateral and
Inventory of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) and in any
event within 75 business days after the Closing Date, (A) remove references to
"Aptuit" and "Indigo" from any signage on any Owned Property, Leased Property,
vehicles or other assets (other than Inventory and Collateral,

 



41  and other than interior signage, heavy machinery, tools and dyes, for which
such removal must occur in the next replacement cycle in the ordinary course
of business) and (B) remove references to "Aptuit" and "Indigo" from any
websites operated in connection with the Business. In no event shall
Purchaser, Company or any Company Subsidiary use any reference to "Aptuit" or
"Indigo" after the Closing Date in any manner or for any purpose different
from the use of "Aptuit" or "Indigo", respectively, by the Business during the
90-day period preceding the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
all times after the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary may (i) use "Aptuit" and "Indigo" as permitted or required by Law
and/or in a non-trademark manner to describe the history of the Business
and (ii) retain and use without modification any legal documents, business
correspondence and similar items that contain the terms "Aptuit" and "Indigo".
Within six months after the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees that it will, and
will cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to, destroy or return to
Seller any remaining Collateral and Inventory of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that contains any reference to "Aptuit" or "Indigo". " _Aptuit_
" and " _Indigo_ " each means any brand name, trademark or service mark under
which the Business has at any time been conducted or which at any time has
been used by or in the Business and contains "Aptuit" or "Indigo"
respectively, and any name that is confusingly similar thereto. At Purchasers
request, for six months after the Closing Date, Seller shall display on its
websites, in all places where the Business was previously discussed or
displayed, a mutually-agreed statement about Purchasers new ownership of the
Business and a link to any website designated by Purchaser.

(b) Within 30 business days of the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company
and each Company Subsidiary to file the relevant documents so as to change
their respective corporate names to names not including or confusingly
similar to "Aptuit". Within 30 business days of the Closing, to the extent
necessary, Purchaser shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to
file the relevant documents so as to amend or terminate any certificates of
assumed name or d/b/a filings by such entities that contain "Aptuit". Except
as expressly permitted in Section 7.02(a), neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall use "Aptuit" at any time or in any way following the
Closing.

(c) Intellectual Property License. Effective as of and only upon the Closing:

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller and its
subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) hereby
grant and agree to grant to Purchaser, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-sublicensable and
non-assignable (except as provided in Section 7.02(c)(iii) and
(iv)), royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide license, in connection with the
current and future operation of the Business, to use and exercise all rights
under all Intellectual Property and Technology (other than trademarks and
other source indicators, but including the items listed on Section 7.02(c)(i)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule), that is owned by Seller and its
subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company

 



42  Subsidiaries) and is used in connection with the Business as of or prior to
Closing (including after giving effect to the Restructuring and Section
7.02(d)).

 

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries hereby grant and agree to grant to Seller and its
subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-sublicensable and non-assignable
(except as provided in Section 7.02(c)(iii) and (iv)), royalty-free, fully
paid-up, worldwide license, in connection with the current and future
operation of the Retained Business, to use and exercise all rights under all
Intellectual Property and Technology (other than trademarks and other
source indicators, but including the items listed on Section 7.02(c)(ii) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule or, subject to the last sentence of this
Section 7.02(c)(ii), assigned to the Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant
to Section 7.02(d)), that is owned by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and is used by Seller and its subsidiaries (other than the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in connection with the Retained Business
as of or prior to Closing (including after giving effect to the Restructuring
and Section 7.02(d)). For clarity, no license is being granted by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with any Intellectual Property or
Technology assigned pursuant to Section 7.02(d) herein that is exclusively
used in the Business.

(iii) Notwithstanding the Assignment provision in Section 12.01 below, Seller
and its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, or Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, as the case may be, may (a) assign the license set forth in
Section 7.02(c)(i) or Section 7.02(c)(ii), respectively, in whole or in part
to any Affiliate, or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or sale of
all, or substantially all, of any of the businesses or any material portion
of the assets to which this license relates (including to the purchaser of any
site), so long as: (x) the assigning party provides the other party with
prompt written notice of such transaction; and (y) the assignment shall be
expressly limited to the business in which the assignor was engaged at the
time of the assignment, _provided_ that no such assignment pursuant to this
Section 7.02(c)(iii) shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder and (b) assume this license in bankruptcy. In the event of a
permitted assignment hereunder, the license granted herein shall bind the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

(iv) Seller and its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, as the case may be, may sublicense the license set forth in
Section 7.02(c)(i) or Section 7.02(c)(ii), as applicable, to (a) its and their
vendors, consultants, contractors and suppliers, in connection with their
providing services to Seller or its subsidiaries, or to Purchaser, the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable; (b) its and their distributors,
customers and end-users, in connection with the distribution, licensing,
offering and sale of the current and

 



43  future products and services of Seller or its subsidiaries, or Purchaser,
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

(v) All rights not expressly granted by a party hereunder are reserved to such
party. Each party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) except as provided in the
Transition Services Agreement, the other party has no delivery, assistance,
training, maintenance, support or related obligations hereunder with respect
to any Intellectual Property or Technology licensed hereunder; and (ii) the
licenses granted in Section 7.02(c)(i) or Section 7.02(c)(ii) do not include
any Intellectual Property or Technology created, invented, developed or
acquired by either party after the Closing, but include any patents,
continuations, divisions and foreign counterparts that issue after the
Closing, solely to the extent they arise from patents and patent applications
that existed as of the Closing.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries
(other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, execute and
deliver, and take all actions necessary to assign, transfer and convey in the
name of the Company or a Company Subsidiary all of Sellers or such
subsidiaries right, title and interest in the Intellectual Property
and Technology set forth on Section 7.02(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

SECTION 7.03. _Securities Act._  Purchaser shall not offer to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Shares in violation of any of the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

SECTION 7.04. _Directors and Officers._ (a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall make any claim against, or
seek any indemnification from, any present or former director or officer of
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to the execution of their
duties up to the termination of their appointment or under, in connection
with, arising out of, resulting from or in any way related to the
Acquisition, this Agreement, the Other Transaction Documents or any other
matter contemplated hereby or thereby, or the process leading up to the
Acquisition or the execution and delivery of this Agreement, or the Other
Transaction Documents, or otherwise.

(b) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors and officers of Company and each Company
Subsidiary, as provided in the Companys or such Company Subsidiarys
Governing Documents with respect to any matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, shall survive the Acquisition and shall continue in full
force and effect. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
amend, restate, repeal or otherwise modify the indemnification and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions of the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys Governing Documents after the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
as of the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, were directors or
officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, unless such amendment,
restatement, repeal or modification is required by applicable Law.

 



44 (c) If Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successor and assigns of Purchaser, the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of this Section 7.04.

 

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing
each of the present and former directors and officers of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be an express third party beneficiary of this Section
7.04.

SECTION 7.05.  _Financing._ (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, and
shall not permit without the prior written consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt
Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces (or
could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount unless (A) the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount and (B) after giving effect to any of the transactions referred to in
clause (A) above, the representation and warranty set forth in Section 6.06
shall be true) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Debt Financing or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Debt
Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)
prevent or make less likely or materially delay the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the
date of the Closing or (B) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (
_provided_ that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 7.05, Purchaser may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to
add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents). Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement.

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full
force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms no less favorable
to Seller (including with respect to the conditionality thereof), (iii) comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, and (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive
agreements thereto and to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing Date, including using its reasonable best efforts (including through
litigation pursued in good faith) to cause the lenders and the other persons
committing to fund the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing at the
Closing and (v) to enforce its rights (including, with respect to Debt
Financing sources, through litigation pursued in good

 



45  faith) under the Debt Commitment Letter. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Acquisition and to the extent possible with other
terms no less favorable to Purchaser, taken as a whole, than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Debt Commitment Letter relating to the Debt Financing may be superseded at
the option of Purchaser after the date hereof but prior to the Closing by new
debt financing commitments (the " _New Financing Commitments_ ") which replace
existing debt financing commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter;
_provided_ , that the terms of the New Financing Commitments shall not (x)
reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount unless (A) the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount and (B) after giving effect to any of the transactions referred to in
clause (A) above, the representation and warranty set forth in Section 6.06
shall be true), (y) impose new or additional conditions or adversely amend or
expand the conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing at the Closing
in any respect, or (z) include other changes that would make the consummation
of the Debt Financing less likely or materially delay the consummation of the
Debt Financing or adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter. In such event,
the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " as used herein shall be deemed to
include the commitment letters relating to the New Financing Commitments.

 

(c) Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which Purchaser becomes aware, or any
termination of the commitments thereunder of which Purchaser becomes aware.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller
prompt notice (A) of any breach or default by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing
of which Purchaser becomes aware, (B) of the receipt of (x) any written notice
or (y) other written communication, in each case from any Debt Financing
source with respect to any (1) material breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing or (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing with respect to the
obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to
be funded at the Closing and (C) if at any time for any reason Purchaser
believes in good faith that there is a material possibility that it will not
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two
Business Days of the date Seller delivers to Purchaser a written request
therefor, Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of
the immediately preceding sentence. Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a
reasonably current basis 

 



46  of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to
Seller copies of all executed material definitive documents related to the
Debt Financing.

 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to the Closing.

SECTION 7.06. _IT Matters._

(a) Prior to Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at
Sellers sole expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to separate
logically the Enterprise Resource Planning (" _ERP_ ") and Customer
Relationship Management (" _CRM_ ," and together with ERP, the " _IT Systems_
") of the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) from the IT Systems of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, in such a manner that allows the Business to transition to a
stand-alone IT System (the " _IT Systems Separation_ "). Seller shall provide
Purchaser with regular updates (not less frequently than weekly) on the
status of the above separation, and Purchaser shall be allowed to test and
validate that the separation has been completed to Purchasers reasonable
satisfaction; _provided_ that such testing and validation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries or
with Sellers efforts to comply with the first sentence of this Section
7.06(a). To the extent that the IT Systems Separation is not completed by
the Closing, Seller shall continue to effect the IT Systems Separation after
the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement;
_provided_ that any expenses derived from the IT Systems Separation shall be
treated as "set up charges" under the Transition Services Agreement and shall
be the responsibility of the Providing Party (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement).

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that, except as set forth in Section
7.06(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and will pay all expenses (other than ongoing maintenance and
support fees, costs or expenses incurred by the Business after the Closing)
related to, causing the Company or a Company Subsidiary to be party as of
Closing to all software licenses or related information technology agreements
used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct their business as
of the date hereof, including those agreements to be assigned to Seller under
the Restructuring Agreement (the " _IT Agreements_ "). To the extent that as
of Closing the Company or a Company Subsidiary is not party to all the IT
Agreements, Seller shall continue to effect the transfer, modification or
other necessary action in respect of the IT Agreements to the Company or a
Company Subsidiary after the Closing ( _provided_ that such actions shall be
effected not later than 45 days after Closing, and _provided_ that nothing
herein shall limit Sellers obligations under the Transition Services
Agreement). To the extent that, on or after the Closing, the Seller or any of
its Affiliates retain any rights or obligations under any of the IT
Agreements, Seller shall be responsible for any fees, relicenses, penalties,
costs or expenses that relate to Seller or its Affiliates retaining such
rights or obligations, but Seller shall not be required to pay any expenses
derived from any additional seats or licenses requested by Purchaser after the
Closing under the IT Agreements.

 



47 (c) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prior to Closing, take
all actions necessary to (i) assign, transfer and convey in the name of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary all hardware (including computers and servers,
storage and networking assets) owned by the Seller or its Affiliates that is
exclusively used in the Business or is Shared Hardware and (ii) physically
transfer such hardware and Shared Hardware to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary. For the purposes of this Section 7.06(c), " _Shared Hardware_ "
shall mean any hardware (including computers (other than individual personal
computers and laptops provided to employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries that
are not employees of the CTS Business) and servers, storage and networking
assets) that are held in the Kansas City, Missouri IT facility and are used
to support any applications that are shared between the Business and the
Retained Business (other than any applications related to ERP).

(d) Seller shall (and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company or the respective Company
Subsidiary prior to Closing to enter into a separate Contract (which may
consist of amendments to existing Contracts) with Microsoft Licensing, GP or
any of its Affiliates (" _MSFT_ ") in respect of the MSFT software that
transfers to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries rights to use the MSFT
software substantially in the same manner as such MSFT software has been used
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to Closing (the " _MSFT
Transfer_ "). To the extent that as of Closing the MSFT Transfer has not been
completed, Seller shall continue to (and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
with Seller to) effect the MSFT Transfer after the Closing ( _provided_ that
such transfer shall be effected not later than 45 days after Closing). Seller
shall be responsible for any fees, relicenses, penalties, costs or expenses
incurred by the Company that relate to the MSFT Transfer (but not any ongoing
maintenance and support fees, costs or expenses incurred by the Business
after the Closing). The Parties agree that the Company or a Company
Subsidiary will, as of the Closing, retain the rights under the agreement
entered into with Oracle America, Inc. or any of its Affiliates (" _Oracle_ ")
in respect of the Oracle database, and the parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other and Oracle to, at Sellers
expense, transfer to Seller and its Affiliates the licenses under the Oracle
database exclusively used by Seller and its Affiliates in the Retained
Business prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 8.02. _Antitrust Notification and Other Regulatory Filings._ (a)
Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, in consultation and cooperation with the
other and as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 15

control or competition Law, as the case may be. Each of Seller and Purchaser

assistance as the other party may request in connection with its preparation
of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act or any other
such non-U.S. merger control or competition Law, (ii) give the other

Governmental Entity or members of any 

 



49  Governmental Entitys staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Acquisition and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from
the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity, as applicable, as promptly
as practicable. Any such additional information shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or other applicable non-U.S.
merger control or competition Law, as the case may be. Purchaser agrees not
to extend directly or indirectly any waiting period under the HSR Act or any
other non-U.S. merger control or competition Law or enter into any agreement
with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall use (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries
to use) reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain any clearance required, (ii)
resolve any objections as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity and (iii)
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment, in each case, under the HSR Act
and any other applicable merger control or competition Law necessary for the

shall include (A) contesting and resisting any Proceeding instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any competition or antitrust Law or other such Law,
(B) attempting to have repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable any Law or
Injunction, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Injunction, that is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Entity that would make the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of
businesses, product lines, assets or operations of the Business, and (D)
conducting Purchasers clinical supplies business or the Business in a
specified manner, or proposing and agreeing or permitting to conduct
Purchasers clinical supplies business or the Business in a specified manner,
including by agreeing to undertakings required by a Governmental Entity that
it will take, or refrain from taking, any action, in each case, to the extent
necessary to obtain any such clearance, resolve any such objections or avoid
or eliminate any such impediments; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the
obligations in clauses (C) and (D) above shall only apply to the extent any
such sale, divestiture, disposition, agreement or undertaking would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material and adverse effect on the
Purchasers clinical trial business or on the Business ( _provided_ that
the threshold for materiality shall be measured solely with respect to the
Business) and (y) the effectiveness of any such action shall be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Acquisition.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in clauses (C) and (D)
of Section 8.02(b) above, nothing in this Agreement, including this Section
8.02 or the "reasonable best efforts" or other similar standard generally,
shall require, or be construed to require, Purchaser to proffer to or agree
to, or to permit Seller to proffer to or agree to, sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold

 



50  separate or agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of
Purchaser or its respective Affiliates or of the Business (or to consent to
any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other
encumberment by Seller of any of the Business assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or to any agreement by
Seller to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to any changes
(including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other
impairment of Purchasers ability to own or operate, any such assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein
or Purchasers ability, after giving effect to the Restructuring, to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

SECTION 8.03.  _Post-Closing Cooperation._ Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other, and shall cause their respective Representatives to
cooperate with each other for a period of one year after the Closing to ensure
the orderly transition of the Business from Seller to Purchaser and to
minimize any disruption to the Business and the other respective businesses of
Seller, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and Purchaser that might result
from the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable
written notice, each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other and their respective Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to such information, Records (including
furnishing copies thereof) and assistance (including access to personnel)
relating to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Business (to the
extent within the control of such party) as is reasonably necessary (i)
for financial reporting and accounting matters, (ii) for the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns, (iii) for other reasonable business purposes, (iv)
to facilitate the investigation, litigation, settlement and final disposition
of any claims, including Tax Claims or assessments, that may have been or may
be made by or against Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
or (v) in connection with any investigation by any Governmental Entity or
otherwise to comply with applicable Law. The obligation to cooperate pursuant
to the preceding sentence insofar as it concerns Taxes shall terminate at the
time the relevant applicable statute of limitations expires (giving effect to
any extension thereof). Purchaser and Seller each shall reimburse the other
party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting
the other party or their respective Affiliates pursuant to this Section 8.03.
Neither Purchaser, nor Seller shall be required by this Section 8.03 to take
any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business
or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations.

SECTION 8.04. _Publicity._ Seller and Purchaser agree that, from the date
hereof through the Closing, no public release or announcement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by either
party or its Affiliates without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or non-U.S. securities exchange or listing
authority based on advice of counsel, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall allow the other party a 

 



51  reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance; _provided_ that each of Seller and Purchaser may make
internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent with
such partys prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby and otherwise have been made in accordance with this Section 8.04.
Seller and Purchaser agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the
form, of substance and with timing agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser.

 

SECTION 8.05. _Tax Matters_. (a) (i)The amount of any refunds of Taxes with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including that portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing
Date determined in accordance with Section 10.03(e)) shall be for the account
of Seller to the extent such Taxes are indemnified by Seller pursuant to
Section 10.03(a). The amount of any other refunds of Taxes of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall be for the account of Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such refunds of Taxes shall be for the
account of Purchaser to the extent such refunds are (i) attributable
(determined on a marginal basis) to the carryback from a Post-Closing Tax
Period of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items, of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of their respective Affiliates,
including Purchaser) or (ii) taken into account for purposes of determining
the Closing Working Capital.

(ii) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall forward, or cause to be forwarded, to
the party entitled pursuant to Section 8.05(a)(i) to receive the amount of a
refund of Taxes the amount of such refund within 10 days after such refund is
received, including any interest received in respect thereof from the
applicable Taxing Authority.

(iii) If, subsequent to a Taxing Authoritys allowance of a refund, such
Taxing Authority reduces or eliminates such allowance, any refund, plus any
interest received thereon, that is forwarded or reimbursed under Section
8.05(a)(ii) shall be returned to the party that had forwarded or reimbursed
such refund and interest, upon the request of such forwarding party, in an
amount equal to the applicable reduction, including any interest received
thereon.

(b) All Transfer Taxes that arise on the sale of the Shares by Seller under
this Agreement shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller agree that
any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party
will use its reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party
at least ten days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

(c) Any VAT that arises on the sale of the Shares by Seller under this
Agreement shall be borne by Purchaser to the extent such sale constitutes a
taxable supply for VAT purposes and upon receipt of a valid VAT invoice.

 



52 (d) (i) Seller shall prepare on behalf of the Company all Tax Returns of the
Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods for which Seller
has an indemnity obligation pursuant to Section 10.03(a) (" _Seller Prepared
Tax Returns_ "). Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a draft of each Seller
Prepared Tax Return at least 30 days prior to the date such Tax Return is
required to be filed. Such Seller Prepared Tax Returns shall, unless otherwise
required by Law or with the consent of Purchaser, be filed in a manner
consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken, election made
or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not require that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary enter into any election, such that the relevant Company or
Company Subsidiary assumes any liability for Tax which is primarily a
liability of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. Seller shall cause the Company
or the relevant Company Subsidiary to execute and timely file, as prepared,
all Seller Prepared Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or prior to
the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall cause the Company or the relevant
Company Subsidiary to execute and timely file, as prepared, all Seller
Prepared Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the Closing Date;
_provided_ that in each case Purchaser shall deliver to Seller within 15 days
after receiving a Seller Prepared Tax Return a detailed written statement
describing all of its objections (if any) thereto, and Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such objections; _provided
further_ that in each case failure of Purchaser to so object shall constitute
acceptance thereof.

(ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser, no later than five business days prior to
the due date for filing a Seller Prepared Tax Return that is required to be
filed after the Closing Date, the full amount of Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Return that are allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including the
portion of Taxes for a Straddle Period that is allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period pursuant to Section 10.03(e).

(iii) Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns (subject to Section 8.05(d)(i)), and in
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating
to Taxes and in any other matters relating to Taxes, including by maintaining
and making available to each other, as reasonably needed, all Records in
connection with Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such
information and other data shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party has been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate as soon as practicable after Closing
to make an application pursuant to section 43 VATA for Glasgow and Deeside
(to the extent Glasgow and Deeside have not already been removed from the VAT
Group prior to the Closing Date) to be excluded from the VAT Group with effect
from the Closing Date or such later date as the relevant Taxing Authority may
permit. Seller shall cause Glasgow and Deeside to contribute to the
Representative Member an amount equal to such proportion of any VAT for which
the Representative Member is accountable as is properly attributable to
supplies made by Glasgow and Deeside while it was a member of

 



53  the VAT Group less such amount of deductible input Tax as is properly
attributable to those supplies. The due date for payment of such contribution
shall be the later of:

 

(i) the fifth business day after Purchaser or the Representative Member makes
a demand for payment; and

 

(ii) the fifth business day before the last date on which the Representative
Member is liable to pay for such VAT to the relevant Taxing Authority in
order to avoid any related interest or penalty.

(f) Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by law, cause the Company and
each Company Subsidiary to surrender to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (the
" _Claimant Company_ ") such Group Relief as Seller may direct in writing in
respect of any accounting period of the Company or Company Subsidiary
beginning before the Closing and no consideration shall be payable by the
Claimant Company in respect of any claim for Group Relief made in accordance
with this Section 8.05(f).

 

(g) Seller shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available
exemptions from any Transfer Taxes or fees applicable to the Acquisition, and
to cooperate with Purchaser in providing any information and documentation
that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

(h) None of Purchaser, any of Purchasers Affiliates, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries shall take any action (including amending any Tax Return
or making any voluntary change in accounting principles or in the treatment
of any item for Tax purposes) after the Closing that would materially increase
Sellers or any of its Affiliates liability for Taxes (including any
liability of Seller to indemnify Purchaser for Taxes under this Agreement but
excluding any liability for Taxes for which Seller is indemnified under
Section 10.03(c)), except as required by law. Neither Seller nor any of
Sellers Affiliates shall take any action (including amending any Tax
Return or making any voluntary change in accounting principles or in the
treatment of any item for Tax purposes) that would materially increase
Purchasers or any of its Affiliates liability for Taxes (including any
liability of Purchaser to indemnify Seller for Taxes under this Agreement but
excluding any liability for Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnified under
Section 10.03(a) or (b)), except as required by law.

 

(i) For all Tax purposes, each of Purchaser, Seller and their respective
Affiliates agrees to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price received by Seller for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless a final determination (as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code) provides otherwise.

 

SECTION 8.06. _Record Retention._ Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that,
for a period of not less than five years following the Closing Date (or such
longer period as may be required by applicable Law), it shall not destroy or
otherwise dispose, or permit the destruction or disposal, of any of the
Records relating to the Business in its or its Affiliates possession; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Records relating to the finances and

 



54  Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Tax Records_ ") shall
not be destroyed or otherwise disposed of until 60 days following the
expiration of the statutes of limitations (including any extensions thereof)
for the taxable period or periods to which such Tax Records relate; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that such Tax Records may be destroyed or otherwise
disposed of 60 days after the expiration of the statutes of limitations
(including any extensions thereof) for the taxable period or periods to which
such Tax Records relate without any restriction under this Agreement. Except
as required by Law, each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the right to
destroy all or part of such Records (other than Tax Records) after the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date by giving the other party 20 business days
prior written notice of such intended disposition and by offering to deliver
to such other party, at such other partys expense, custody of such Records
as it intends to destroy. In the event that, at or after the Closing, (a) any
document or information relating to the Business is in or comes into the
possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates, Seller shall promptly deliver
such document or information to Purchaser or (b) any document or information
relating to any business of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Business) is in or comes into the possession of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall promptly deliver such document or information to
Seller. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall cause indices of retained documents
to be maintained and copied to the other party upon written request. Each of
Seller or Purchaser shall allow reasonable access to retained documents upon
written request of the other party within five business days.

SECTION 8.07. _Intercompany Arrangements._ Each of Seller and Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that except as set forth in Section 8.07 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Continuing Arrangements_ ") and
except for arrangements under the Transaction Documents, upon the Closing, all
Contracts or other arrangements (including intercompany balances) between
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and a Company Subsidiary, on
the other hand, that were entered into prior to the Closing will be canceled,
terminated or extinguished, as the case may be, without payment or
liability. 

SECTION 8.08. _Agreement Not To Solicit; Limitations._ (a) During the period
beginning as of the date hereof and ending on the date that is 24 months
after the Closing Date, Seller will not, nor will it permit its directly
controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, except with the prior
written consent of Purchaser, solicit for employment, employ or assist any
other person in employing any Employee; _provided_ that this shall not
preclude Seller or any of its Affiliates from (A) hiring any such Employee who
has had his or her employment terminated by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or (B) from making any general solicitation not specifically
directed towards any such Employee; _provided_ the Seller and its Affiliates
comply with the restrictions on hiring set forth herein.

 

(b) During the period beginning as of the date hereof and ending on the date
that is 24 months after the Closing Date, Purchaser will not, nor will it
permit its directly controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, except

assist any other person in employing 

 



55  any of the persons listed in Section 8.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; _provided_ that this shall not preclude Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates from (A) hiring any such employee who has had his or her
employment terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates or (B) from making
any general solicitation not specifically directed towards any such person;
_provided_ the Purchaser and its controlled Affiliates comply with the
restrictions on hiring set forth herein.

(c) For a period of 24 months on and after the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
controlled Affiliates (each a " _Restricted Party_ ") not to directly or
indirectly engage in any business substantially similar to the Business as
conducted during the twelve month period prior to the Closing or own the
equity securities of, manage, operate or control, any person that engages in a
business substantially similar to the Business as conducted twelve month
period prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that no Restricted Party shall be
prevented from:

(i) acquiring as an investment in the ordinary course of business any
securities required to be registered under the Exchange Act of any person to
the extent that such acquisitions do not result in such person owning in the
aggregate 5% or more of any class of such securities;

(ii) acquiring (through merger, stock purchase or sale of all or substantially
all of the assets or otherwise) ownership of or any equity interest in any
person, _provided_ that the annual revenues of such person from any business
that competes with the Business are not more than 10% of such persons total
annual revenues (based on the most recent full fiscal year revenues of such
person); or

(iii) engaging in the PDM Business to the extent substantially all such
business is conducted at the Sellers Verona, Italy or Glasgow, Scotland
facilities; _provided_ that sales, corporate level services, executive
management and similar activities shall be excluded from such
geographic limitation.

SECTION 8.09. _Repayment of Indebtedness._ Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall cause each obligee of Indebtedness to be Repaid to submit a payoff
letter (or other appropriate documentation with respect to the satisfaction
and cancelation of the Preferred Stock Obligations) with respect to such
Indebtedness to be Repaid (including all ancillary obligations thereto
(including interest, fees and prepayment premiums) for payoff as of close of
business on the Closing Date. Such payoff letters will provide (i) that upon
payment of the amounts specified therein by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, or on their behalf, all commitments related to
such Indebtedness to be Repaid will be terminated, all obligations related to
such Indebtedness to be Repaid (other than indemnification, expense
reimbursement and other contingent obligations) will be satisfied, released
and discharged and all Liens in or upon any of the assets or properties of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary securing such Indebtedness to be Repaid will
be satisfied, released and discharged, and (ii) for the filing of all
documents necessary to effectuate, or reflect in public record, such
satisfaction, release and discharge after such amounts have been paid as
specified therein. On the 

 



56  Closing Date, all Indebtedness to be Repaid shall be repaid by Seller
instructing Purchaser to wire a portion of the Purchase Price (before
adjustment pursuant to Article II to reflect the Estimated Net Funded
Indebtedness) to repay such Indebtedness in accordance with the payoff letters
at or immediately prior to the Effective Time. " _Indebtedness to be Repaid_ "
means all indebtedness set forth on Section 8.09 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

SECTION 8.10. _Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Insurance._ (a) From and after
the Closing Date, the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall cease to be
insured by Seller or its Affiliates insurance policies or programs of self-
insurance, and shall have no access to any such insurance policies or programs
of self-insurance other than as set forth in Section 8.10(b).

(b) For any claim that may be asserted against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date arising out of events, incidents,
conduct or circumstances that occurred prior to the Closing Date (such claims,
" _Post-Closing Claims_ "), the Company and any Company Subsidiary may tender
such Post-Closing Claim to Seller for submission by Seller to the applicable
insurer under any of the occurrence-based insurance policies of Seller or its
Affiliates issued prior to the Closing Date under which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary was insured or potentially insured as of the date of the
events, incidents, conduct or circumstances giving rise to such Post-Closing
Claim (such policies, the " _Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Policies_ " and each
such claim a " _Noticed Post-Closing Claim_ ") and Seller shall thereupon
tender such Post-Closing Claim to the applicable insurer for coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing herein shall diminish or affect any
right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under such Pre-Closing
Occurrence Based Policies to tender any Post-Closing Claims directly to the
applicable insurer should Seller fail or refuse to do so for any reason; and
(ii) the Company shall have no recourse to Seller for any uninsured or
uncovered amounts for such Post-Closing Claims (including any deductible or
other amount for which Seller provides self-insurance), except for amounts
attributable to any failure or refusal by Seller to provide timely notice of
any Noticed Post-Closing Claim to the applicable insurer upon Sellers receipt
of notice of such Noticed Post-Closing Claim from the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Seller shall notify the Company of all coverage determinations
made by the insurer(s) in respect of any Post-Closing Claims and, if any
amounts are paid or to be paid by the insurer in respect thereof, shall
request that such insurer make payment directly to the Company or applicable
Company Subsidiary or shall transfer such insurance proceeds to the Company
or the applicable Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, no later than ten
(10) days after receipt of such insurance proceeds.

 

(c) Seller shall not release, commute, buy-back, or otherwise eliminate the
coverage available under any Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Policy without the
Companys consent.

(d) Subject to and without modification of the foregoing Sections 8.10(a)-(c),
if any Post-Closing Claim is a workers compensation claim alleging
cumulative trauma injury, then (i) if it is finally determined by a court of
law or responsible authority

 



57  that the date of loss was in fact prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall be responsible for the loss exclusively, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall be liable for any portion of such loss; and (ii)
absent a determination set forth in subsection (d)(i) hereof, Seller shall be
responsible for a _pro rata_ share of such Post-Closing Claim, with Sellers
share and the Company or Company Subsidiarys share calculated based upon the
relative periods of time that the injury transpired prior to and on and after
the Closing Date.

SECTION 8.11. _Litigation Support._ In the event and for so long as each party
hereto actively is prosecuting, contesting or defending any Proceeding by a
third party in connection with (a) any transactions contemplated under this
Agreement or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction involving the Business or the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and any of the foregoing require the other partys cooperation due
to such partys ownership of the Business or the Company or any Company
Subsidiary at a relevant time, the requested party shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably with the
requesting party and its counsel, at the requesting partys expense for any
out-of-pocket expenses, in the prosecution, contest or defense, make available
its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records
as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the prosecution, contest
or defense; _provided_ that such support (i) does not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of the requested party, its subsidiaries and controlled
Affiliates, and their respective representatives, (ii) would not be reasonably
expected to violate any attorney-client privilege of the requested party or
violate any applicable Law (including antitrust Laws) and (iii) would not
reasonably be expected to breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any
person whether the duty arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

 

SECTION 8.12. _Further Assurances._ Seller and Purchaser agree that, from time

intents of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.13. _Service Levels in Transition Services Agreement._ Prior to the

SECTION 9.01. _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits._ For a period of one
year from the Closing Date (or for such longer period as required by
applicable Law), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide
(a) to each

 



58  Employee, to the extent employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates during such
period, a base salary or wages, variable pay and incentive or bonus
opportunities, in each case, no less favorable than the base salary or wages,
variable pay and incentive or bonus opportunities provided to each such
Employee as of the Closing and, solely in the case of base salary or wages,
listed in Section 7.05(b)(ii) of Schedule B to the Restructuring Agreement
and (b) to Employees in the aggregate, other employee benefits (excluding

employment is involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, severance and termination
benefits, to the extent applicable, in an amount equal to the severance and
termination benefits that would be due under the applicable severance and
termination benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements or arrangements of
Purchaser and its Affiliates for similarly situated employees of Purchaser
and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by
this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (i) to be obligated to continue the employment of any Employee for
any period of time after the Closing Date or (ii) to maintain any specific
employee benefit plan, arrangement or program or any employment condition.

SECTION 9.02. _Service Credit._ From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser

service with Seller and its Affiliates and predecessors prior to the Closing
Date to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan or Employee Benefit Plan, including for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service shall not be credited for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits, (b) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and
other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser for the benefit of each Employee, employed as of the
Closing, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such Employee under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan, Employee Benefit Plan or any plan,
program, agreement, arrangement or understanding that is required by
applicable Law immediately prior to the Closing and (c) provide full credit
for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments credited under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan or Employee Benefit Plan with respect to
each Employee prior to the Closing for the plan year in which the Closing
occurs. 

SECTION 9.03. _WARN Act and Other Notices._ Purchaser agrees to provide, or to
cause its Affiliates to provide, any required notice under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (together with any similar Federal,
state or local Law of the United States, the " _WARN Act_ ") and to otherwise
comply with the 

 



59  WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in
the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting Employees
(including as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) and occurring on or within 90 days after the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall assume liability for, and shall fully indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates with respect to, any Liability incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the WARN Act in connection with
any Employee, employed as of the Closing Date, to the extent such liability
arises from actions of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on or after the
Effective Time, including with respect to the actions described in the
immediately preceding sentence. Seller agrees to provide, or to cause its
Affiliates to provide, any required notice under the WARN Act and to otherwise
comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
(as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and occurring prior to the
Closing Date. Seller shall assume liability for, and shall fully indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates with respect to, any Liability
incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the WARN Act or any
similar applicable Law in connection with any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, to the extent such liability arises from actions of Seller
or any of its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time. Seller agrees, upon
Purchasers request, to cooperate with Purchaser , or to cause its Affiliates
to cooperate with Purchaser, with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" or group termination or similar event which is anticipated to occur
within 90 days following the Closing Date.

SECTION 9.04. _Special Non-U.S. Provisions._ With respect to any Non-U.S.
Employees, Purchasers and its Affiliates obligations under this Article IX
shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of
the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Employees are based.

 

SECTION 9.05. _No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Amendment._ The provisions of
this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this Article IX, express or implied, shall confer upon any
current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the
Business, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights
or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for
any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Article IX, express or
implied, shall be construed to prevent Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan
that Purchaser or any such Affiliate may establish or maintain.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the terms
of this Article IX are not intended to, and shall not, constitute an amendment
to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Seller, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates.

 

SECTION 9.06. For purposes of Sections 9.02 and 9.03, solely in the case of
any CTS STD Employee (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement), all
references to the Closing, the Closing Date or the Effective Time shall
instead be deemed to refer to such CTS STD Employees Delayed Transfer Date
(as defined in the Restructuring Agreement).

date), disregarding for such purpose in the case of this clause (B) any
limitations or qualifications as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect",
"material" or similar materiality qualification set forth therein; and

 

(ii) any breach of (A) any covenant or agreement of Seller or any of its

real property from Purchaser or the Company or any Company Subsidiary
after the Closing, or (C) arise as a result of any environmental
investigation, testing or sampling at, on or under any Owned Property or
Leased Property after the Closing by or on behalf of Purchaser or any person

imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment or human health;
(iii) in connection with any requirement arising out of the decommissioning at

Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend (or where applicable, pay the
defense costs for and hold harmless, Purchaser and its Affiliates (other than
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, and each of the
heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against, and hold them harmless
from,

 



62  any Loss suffered or incurred by any such Seller Indemnitee to the extent
relating to, arising out of or resulting from:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
made in this Agreement, as of the Closing with the same effect as though made

Effect", "material" or similar materiality qualification set forth therein;
and

excess;

 

(ii) under Section 10.02(a)(i) for any individual item (or series of items

Transaction Document.

 

SECTION 10.03. _Tax Indemnification._ (a) From and after the Closing, Seller

a result of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law or any provision of foreign Law relating to
secondary Tax liabilities or otherwise) for Taxes of Seller or any
other person (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary) which is or
has ever been affiliated with the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with
whom the Company or any Company Subsidiary otherwise joins or has ever joined
(or is or has ever been required to join) in filing any consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate Tax

 



63  Return, prior to the Closing Date, (iii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Seller set forth in Section 5.02(b)(xvi) or Section 8.05, (iv)
without duplication any Taxes incurred from the Restructuring that arise (1)
on or prior to the Closing Date and (2) after the Closing Date to the extent
such Taxes result directly from actions taken pursuant to the Restructuring
Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, any collateral tax consequences, e.g.,
use of net operating losses, resulting from the Restructuring are excluded
from the indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 10.03(a)), (v) any
payments required to be made after the Closing Date under any Tax sharing,
Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar contracts (whether or not written) to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiaries was obligated, or was a party,
on or prior to the Closing Date, (vi) all liability for Taxes (other than
Taxes described in Section 8.05(b) and (c)) arising (directly or indirectly)
as a result of the sale of the Shares or the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including, without limitation, any Taxes arising as a result of the
recognition by Seller, Company or any Company Subsidiary of any "deferred
intercompany gain" or "excess loss account") and (vii) all liability for Taxes
(determined without regard to any deductions, credits, losses or other tax
attributes of Purchaser or its Affiliates) attributable to any deemed royalty
income under Section 367(d) (or any other applicable provision) of the Code
from the transfer of intangible property by Aptuit, Inc. to Aptuit
(Wales) Limited in September 2009 (" _Covered Taxes_ "), but only to the
extent such liability exceeds the aggregate net Tax benefit actually realized
by Purchaser and its Affiliates after Closing from any net operating loss
carryforwards or tax credits of the Company as of the Closing (as may be
adjusted by any taxing authority, " _Pre-Closing Tax Attributes_ ");
_provided_ that Purchaser shall use (or cause its Affiliates after Closing to
use) any Pre-Closing Tax Attributes before using (or causing its Affiliates
after Closing to use) any other tax attributes, to the extent permissible
under applicable Tax Law; _provided further_ that, in each case, Seller shall
not indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee under this Section 10.03 to the extent
that the Tax Liability is reflected in Closing Working Capital or would not
have arisen but for (x) an action or omission carried out or effected on the
Closing Date after Closing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other than
any such action or omission carried out (A) in the ordinary course of business
of Purchaser or its Affiliates, (B) in order to comply with any applicable Law
or as contemplated by this Agreement, (C) taking place with the written
approval of Seller or (D) pursuant to a legally binding obligation of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary entered into on or prior to Closing or (y) a
change in Law or GAAP after the Closing. For the purposes of this Section
10.03(a) other than clause (vii), a Loss shall include a Purchaser
Indemnitees use of any Tax benefit that arises in a Post-Closing Tax Period
to reduce any Tax described in this Section 10.03(a). Notwithstanding clause
(vii) of this Section 10.03(a), until either (x) the Adjusted Pre-Closing Tax
Attributes have been reduced to zero or (y) the aggregate amount of Covered
Taxes realized exceeds the aggregate net Tax benefit that would be realized
by Purchaser and its Affiliates in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Attributes
if all Pre-Closing Tax Attributes had been actually utilized, no payment shall
be due pursuant to clause (vii) to the extent such Covered Taxes are offset
by deductions, credits, losses or other tax attributes of Purchaser or its
Affiliates; provided that if this sentence would apply but for the application
of clause (x) or (y) hereof, the amount of Covered Taxes
indemnifiable pursuant to clause (vii) shall be further reduced by the
aggregate net Tax benefit that

 



64  would be realized by Purchaser and its Affiliates in respect of the Pre-
Closing Tax Attributes if all Adjusted Pre-Closing Tax Attributes were
actually utilized.

 

(b) To the extent not previously indemnified pursuant to clause (vii) of
Section 10.03(a), ten (10) Business Days prior to the Tax Guaranty Expiration
Date, the Seller shall make a payment to the Purchaser equal to all liability
for Covered Taxes through such date but only to the extent such liability
exceeds (i) the aggregate net Tax benefit actually realized by Purchaser and
its Affiliates after Closing from any Pre-Closing Tax Attributes and (ii) the
aggregate net Tax benefit that would be realized by Purchaser and its
Affiliates if the Adjusted Pre-Closing Tax Attributes had been actually
utilized as of such date.

(c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees against, and hold them harmless from, without duplication: (i)
any Taxes for Post-Closing Tax Periods (A) imposed on the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or (B) for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
liable pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law and (ii) any Taxes that arise solely
as a result of the breach of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of
Purchaser contained in Section 8.05. 

(d) Any indemnity payment to be made under this Section 10.03 shall be paid
within 30 days after the indemnified party makes written demand upon the
indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than five (5) business days prior
to the date on which the relevant Taxes (including any estimated Tax payments)
are required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.

(e) Any Taxes, deductions or credits for a Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a
closing of the books basis (subject to any overriding allocation required in
the United Kingdom by Law), except that in the case of Taxes, deductions or
credits determined on a periodic basis, the amount of Tax, deduction or
credit shall be allocated on a daily pro rata basis.

(f) The indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.03 shall survive
the Closing until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof)
with respect to Taxes imposed by any Taxing Authority;  _provided_ that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any item as to which the person to be indemnified or a related party thereto,
or any person on behalf of such indemnified person or related party, shall
have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim
by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis
of such claim) to the indemnifying party.

 

SECTION 10.04. _Limitations on Liability; Cooperation._ (a) Notwithstanding
any provision herein, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall in any event be
liable to the other party or its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives on account of any indemnity obligation set forth in
Section 10.01 or 

 



65  Section 10.02 for any indirect, consequential, special, incidental or
punitive damages (including lost profits, loss of use, damage to goodwill or
loss of business); _provided_ , in each case, that such limitation shall not
limit recovery (x) for any direct damages, (y) for diminution in the value of
any asset of the Business, as of immediately prior to Closing (before giving
effect to the Acquisition but after giving effect to the Restructuring), to
the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from the item giving rise
to the applicable indemnity obligation or (z) to the extent arising from
payments made to a claimant in a Third Party Claim. 

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any Losses or Liabilities with respect to which either party is
obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including (i) by making
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Losses or Liabilities and
(ii) by filing claims, and seeking to recover available amounts, under
applicable insurance policies.

(c) Each of Purchaser and Seller further acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, its and its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to any Transaction Document, the
Acquisition or any other transactions contemplated by any Transaction
Document, the Business, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including
under any Law (other than pursuant to Section 12.11, claims with respect to or
relating to the Restructuring to the extent the subject of Article V or
Section 7.10 of the Restructuring Agreement, claims with respect to the
Transition Services Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and other than claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) or Environmental Law (including
CERCLA or any similar state law), shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article X. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, hereby waives,
on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or Environmental Law
(including CERCLA or any similar state law), any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than pursuant to Section 12.11, claims with respect to
or relating to the Restructuring to the extent the subject of Article V or
Section 7.10 of the Restructuring Agreement, claims with respect to the
Transition Services Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and other than claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) for damages it or any of its
Affiliates may have against Seller (in the case of Purchaser) or Purchaser (in
the case of Seller) or any of their respective Affiliates arising under or
based upon any Transaction Document, the Acquisition or any other
transactions contemplated by any Transaction Document, the Business, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any Law or Environmental Law (including
CERCLA or any similar state law), except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X.

SECTION 10.05. _Calculation of Losses._ (a) For the purposes of
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X, any Losses or
amounts otherwise payable hereunder (including amounts relating to Taxes
pursuant to Section 10.03) shall be (a) determined on the basis of the net
effect after giving effect to any cash payments, setoffs or recoupment (and
any costs and expenses incurred in securing such cash payment, setoff or
recoupment), in each case, actually received or, in the case of setoffs,
retained by the indemnified party (including any amounts recovered by the
indemnified

 



66  party under insurance policies net of the net present value of any
reasonably expected increases in premiums associated with such policies as the
proximate result of such recovery to the extent such increased premiums will
be paid by the indemnified party or its Affiliates) as a result of any event
giving rise to a claim for such indemnification and (b) reduced to take
account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss and increased by the
amount of any Tax detriment resulting from such indemnification claim (an
indemnified party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax
benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable
by such indemnified party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that such
indemnified party would be required to pay but for the receipt of the
indemnity payment or the incurrence or payment of such Loss).

(b) For purposes of the indemnification under Section 10.01(a), Seller shall
not be liable to the extent of any Losses that are proximately caused as
result of (A) any action taken or omitted to be taken by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or (B) any breach by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of a
representation or warranty or covenant under any Transaction Document (it
being understood that, in each case, the calculation of Losses shall not be
affected or otherwise limited by any such act or omission that results in the
discovery, identification or manifestation of the physical or factual
conditions from which such Losses arise that does not exacerbate the
underlying conditions or factual circumstances from which such Losses arose,
_provided_ that the language in this parenthetical shall be disregarded to
the extent such language would otherwise reasonably be read to limit the
provisions of Section 10.01(b)(iv) of this Agreement ). The calculation of any
Losses under this Article X shall take into account the amount by which such
matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price, if any, pursuant to Section 2.02 or in any other Losses that such party
or any of its Affiliates were indemnified for pursuant to this Article X or
Article V of the Restructuring Agreement. The calculation of any Losses
payable to an indemnified party under this Article X relating to, arising out
of or resulting from a guarantee, Non-CTS Liability or other similar indirect
or contingent Liability also shall take into account whether or not payment
of such Liability has been demanded and is due from the indemnified party;
_provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt the reimbursement of defense costs
and other similar Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such
Liability shall not be delayed in any way by this sentence.

SECTION 10.06.  _Termination of Indemnification._ (a) The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to (i) Sections
10.01(a)(i) and 10.02(a)(i) shall terminate when the applicable representation
or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 10.06(b), (ii) Section
10.01(a)(ii)(A) shall terminate at the close of business on the 18 month
anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) the other clauses of Sections 10.01
and 10.02 shall not terminate;  _provided_ that, as to clauses (i) and (ii)
of this sentence, such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified or
a related party thereto, or any person on behalf of such indemnified person
or related party, shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the indemnifying party.

 



67 (b) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing solely for purposes of Sections 10.01 and 10.02 and shall
terminate at the close of business on the 18 month anniversary of the Closing
Date; _provided_ that the Seller Fundamental Representations shall survive
indefinitely, the representations and warranties in Section 4.16(g) shall
terminate at the Closing, and the representations and warranties in paragraphs
(a) through (f) of Section 4.16 shall terminate at the close of business on
the three year anniversary of the Closing Date.

SECTION 10.07. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party
Claims._  (a) If a party intends to seek indemnification (the " _indemnified
party_ ") with respect to any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by
any person not a party, or an Affiliate of a party, to this Agreement against
such indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party
must notify the party responsible for such indemnification (the "
_indemnifying party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third
Party Claim within 20 business days after receipt by such indemnified party of
written notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been materially and actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party
shall not be liable for any defense expenses incurred during the period in
which such indemnified party failed to give such notice as required above).
Thereafter, such indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party,
promptly after such indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by such indemnified
party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against any indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; _provided_ that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by such indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to any indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying party assumes such defense, each indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not to
be unreasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by any indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim (other than during
the period prior to the time the indemnified party failed to give notice of
such Third Party Claim as required by Section 10.07(a) as provided above).

(c) If the indemnifying party so elects to defend or prosecute any Third Party
Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the indemnifying
party in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the
indemnifying party of Records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and 

 



68  making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If
the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying party may enter into, and the indemnified party shall consent to,
any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that by its
terms (i) obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the
Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii) unconditionally
releases such indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party
Claim, (iii) does not require an express admission of wrongdoing by
the indemnified party and (iv) does not provide for injunctive or other non-
monetary relief affecting the indemnified party in any way.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.07, the
indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel incurred by any indemnified party in defending such Third Party Claim)
if (i) such indemnifying party has not acknowledged in writing its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified party in accordance with this Article X against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, (ii) such indemnified
party shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after conferring with
its outside counsel, that an actual or a potential conflict of interest
relating to the indemnifying party makes representation by the indemnifying
partys counsel inappropriate, (iii) such Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money
damages against such indemnified party that the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages or (iv) such Third Party Claim
alleges criminal conduct or involves criminal penalties with respect to such
indemnified party or its Affiliates.

(e) Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, no indemnified party shall admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ that such
indemnified party shall not enter into, and the indemnifying party shall not
be required to consent to the entry into, any settlement, compromise or
discharge that (i) requires an express admission of wrongdoing by the
indemnifying party or (ii) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary
relief affecting the indemnifying party in any way.

 

(f) If the indemnifying party elects not to defend the indemnified party
against a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right but
not the obligation to assume its own defense and prosecute, appeal, negotiate,
resolve, settle, compromise, arbitrate or otherwise pursue such Third Party
Claim, in whole or in part, at its sole cost and expense (or, if the matter
in question is one for which the indemnified party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article X, at the expense of the indemnifying
party); _provided_ that (i) in taking any action with respect to such Third
Party Claim, the indemnified party shall act reasonably and in good faith,
(ii) the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but the indemnified
party shall control such defense,

 



69  and (iii) the indemnifying party shall not be obligated to indemnify the
indemnified party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment
that was consented to without the indemnifying partys prior written consent;
_provided_ that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold such
consent; it being understood that the indemnified partys right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(g) The indemnifying and indemnified party shall use reasonable best efforts
to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with Law), and to
cause all communications among employees, counsel and other representing any
party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privileges.

(h) Nothing in this Section 10.07 shall be construed to apply to procedures
relating to indemnification of Tax Claims, which are exclusively governed by
Section 10.09.

SECTION 10.08.  _Procedures Related to Indemnification for Other Claims._ In
the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying
party under Section 10.01 or 10.02 that does not involve a Third Party Claim
being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party,
the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim to the indemnifying
party promptly after obtaining knowledge of such claim. The failure by such
indemnified party so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such
indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified
party under Section 10.01 or 10.02, except to the extent that such
indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially and actually
prejudiced by such failure. If such indemnifying party disputes its liability
with respect to such claim, such indemnifying party and such indemnified party
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and,
if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in
Section 12.12.

SECTION 10.09. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims._ (a) If
a claim relating to Taxes shall be made against any indemnified party (the "
_Tax Indemnified Party_ ") by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to any Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to
Article X, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party
responsible for such indemnification (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") in
writing of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party has been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim for which the Tax Indemnifying Party is
solely responsible, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall control all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, Proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any Taxing Authority with respect

 



70  thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue
for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax
Claim in any permissible manner;  _provided_ , _however_ , the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim that
would have a material impact on the Tax Indemnified Party (disregarding any
impact on the net operating losses or other tax attributes of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date). In no case shall any Tax
Indemnified Party settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim without the Tax
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Tax
Claim relating to a Straddle Period, (i) neither party shall control the
proceedings and each party shall have the right to participate fully in all
aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim and (ii) neither
party shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the
other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 

(c) Each party shall cooperate with the other party in contesting any Tax
Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision to the other party of Records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
or explanation of any material provided hereunder.

SECTION 10.10. _Escrow._ (a) The Escrow Account established in accordance
with Section 2.01(d) shall be invested, maintained and disbursed in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Amount shall be available to satisfy any and all claims of (i) the
Purchaser Indemnitees set forth in Article X of this Agreement or (ii) the
Holdings Indemnitees (as such term is defined in the Restructuring Agreement)
pursuant to Article V of the Restructuring Agreement. Solely in respect of
claims pursuant to Section 10.01(a)(i), Purchaser shall proceed first against
the Escrow Account to the extent of the funds available therein to satisfy any
such claims and may not proceed directly against Seller with respect thereto
unless and until sufficient funds are no longer available in the Escrow
Account (either because claims against the Escrow Account exceed the available
balance therein or because any remaining balance therein has been distributed
to Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement).

(b) On the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Original Escrow
Expiration Date_ "), except as otherwise provided in Sections 10.10(c) and
10.10(d), all remaining funds of the Escrow Amount shall be disbursed to
Seller, together with the earnings thereon.

 

(c) If on the Original Escrow Expiration Date (i) the applicable conditions
set forth on Section 10.10(c)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with
respect to the Non-CTS Liabilities set forth therein have not been satisfied
or (ii) the applicable conditions set forth on Section 10.10(c)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Non-CTS Liabilities set forth
therein have not been satisfied, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow
Account all remaining funds until the date on which all the conditions
referenced in clause (i) above have been satisfied (such date, the " _Lease
Release Date_ ") and the date on which all the conditions referenced in clause
(ii) above

 



71  have been satisfied (such date, the " _PSA Release Date_ " and the date by
which the Lease Release Date and PSA Release Date have occurred, the " _Escrow
Release Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if, on October 1, 2013, the
Lease Release Date has occurred and the PSA Release Date has not occurred
(such date, the " _Escrow Reduction Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall disburse
to Seller any funds in the Escrow Account to the extent such funds exceed
$12,500,000 and retain $12,500,000 in the Escrow Account until the earlier of
the third anniversary of the Closing Date and the PSA Release Date (such date,
the " _PSA Final Escrow Release Date_ "). If, on the PSA Final Escrow Release
Date, the Lease Release Date has occurred, all remaining funds in the Escrow
Account shall be disbursed to Seller, together with earnings thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disbursements pursuant to this Section
10.10(c) shall be subject to Section 10.10(d).

(d) Subject to the restrictions in Section 10.10(c), if on the Original
Escrow Expiration Date, the Escrow Release Date or the PSA Final Escrow
Release Date, there is then pending and unresolved one or more claims of the
Purchaser Indemnitees and if the Purchaser Indemnitees have delivered to
Seller and to the Escrow Agent a notice on or prior to the Original Escrow
Expiration Date, Escrow Release Date or PSA Final Escrow Release Date,
respectively, setting forth an updated description in reasonable detail of
all such claims to the extent known and the amount of each such claim to the
extent reasonably quantifiable, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow
Account, pending resolution of such claims, an amount equal to the aggregate
amount so claimed, and upon final disposition of each such claim the Escrow
Agent shall disburse to Seller the amount so withheld in excess of the
remaining claim as finally resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the
Escrow Reduction Date, the aggregate amount of such claims is equal to or
greater than $12,500,000, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse any funds to
Seller on the Escrow Reduction Date until such claims are resolved.

 

(e) Seller agrees that it will only request that the Escrow Agent disburse
funds to it from the Escrow Account if it is entitled to such disbursement
pursuant to this Section 10.10. Promptly following any event pursuant to which
Seller or Purchaser is entitled to a disbursement of funds from the Escrow
Account in accordance with this Section 10.10, Purchaser and Seller agree to
execute and provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release
from the Escrow Account to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, any funds
permitted to be disbursed hereunder.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

 _Termination_

Acquisition and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at
any time prior to the Closing by:

 

(a) the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(b) Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if there shall have been a
breach by Purchaser of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations 

 



72  contained herein, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any
condition set forth in Section 3.02, and any such breach shall be incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
60 days after written notice thereof shall have been received by Purchaser;

(c) Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller, if there shall have been a
breach by Seller of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations contained herein, which breach would result in the failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in Section 3.01, and any such breach shall be
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured within 60 days after written notice thereof shall have been received by
Seller;

 

(d) Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other party, if the
Closing does not occur on or prior to January 31, 2012 (such date, the "
_Outside Date_ "); or

(e) Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other party, if any
Law, Injunction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the
Acquisition shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable.

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to
clause (b), (c) or (d) is not in breach in any material respect of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any condition
set forth in Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.02(a) with respect to such party,
as applicable.

SECTION 11.02. _Return of Confidential Information._ If this Agreement is
terminated and the Acquisition and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are abandoned as provided in this Article XI:

(a) notwithstanding any provision in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser shall return to Seller all documents and other material
received by Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
from Seller, its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and their respective Representatives relating to the Acquisition
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether so obtained
before or after the execution hereof; and

their respective Representatives with respect to Seller, its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and their respective
Representatives or the Business, shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.03. _Consequences of Termination._ In the event of termination by
Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this Article XI, written notice thereof shall
promptly be given to the other party and the Acquisition and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by either party. If this Agreement is terminated and the

keep confidential certain information and data obtained by it, (b) Section
8.04 relating to publicity, (c) this Article XI, (d) Section 12.03 relating to
certain expenses, and (e) Section 12.09 relating to finders fees
and brokers fees. Nothing in this Article XI shall be deemed to release
either Seller or Purchaser from any Liability for any breach by such party of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to such termination or to
impair the right of either party to compel specific performance by the other
party of its obligations under this Agreement that survive such termination.

ARTICLE XII

_Miscellaneous_

 

SECTION 12.01. _Assignment._ This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder and under the Other Transaction Documents shall not be assignable
or transferable by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto (including by operation of Law in connection with a
merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of any
party hereto); except that either party may assign (including by operation of
Law in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all
the assets of any party hereto); all or any of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder or under the Other Transaction Documents to (i) any of
its Affiliates or (ii) following Closing, (A) in the case of Purchaser, any
subsequent purchaser (whether by merger, consolidation or sale) of all or
substantially all of the Business or any material portion of the assets
thereof and (B) in the case of Seller, any subsequent purchaser of all or
substantially all of the Retained Business or any material portion of the
assets thereof; _provided_ that (x) such assignment shall not relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder and (y) Purchaser may
assign in whole or in part, its rights under this Agreement without the
consent of any other party thereto for collateral security purposes to any
Lender, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of
its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
Section 12.01 shall be void.

 

SECTION 12.02. _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as expressly provided in
Sections 7.04, 12.01, 12.12, 12.13, 12.14 and 12.15 and Article X (it being
understood that each Lender is an intended beneficiary of Section 12.01,
12.12, 12.13, 12.14 and 12.15), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the

instrument in writing, Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other

provision of this Agreement that such other party or parties were or are
obligated to comply with or perform. Any such waiver shall only be effective
in the specific instance and for the specific and limited purpose for which it
was given and shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this
Agreement or of the same breach or default upon any recurrence thereof. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right.

permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by

herein. Any capitalized term used in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any
Exhibit, but not otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning ascribed to
such term in this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or a question of

SECTION 12.07. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile, email or other electronic imaging means shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 12.08. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

 

SECTION 12.09. _Fees._ Seller hereby represents and warrants that the only
brokers or finders that have acted for it in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or that may be entitled to any
brokerage fee, finders fee or commission in respect thereof are J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC and Seller shall pay all fees or commissions which may
be payable to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Purchaser represents and warrants
that no brokers or finders have acted for it in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby based on upon arrangement made by or
on behalf of Purchaser for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could
have any Liability prior to the Closing or Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary) could have any Liability.

 



91 SECTION 12.10. _Severability._ If any term, covenant, restriction or provision
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, illegal, void or incapable of being enforced by any
applicable Law or public policy, all other terms, covenants, restrictions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such
determination that any term, covenant, restriction or other provision is
invalid, illegal, void or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 12.11. _Enforcement._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled
to equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in an appropriate court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in Section 12.12, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity, but in any
event, subject to the limitations provided in this Agreement. The right to
specific enforcement shall include the right of the parties to cause the
Restructuring, the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree (a) to cooperate
fully in any attempt by the other party to obtain any such equitable remedy,
(b) to waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with any such equitable remedy and (c) not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that such right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the
parties hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.

SECTION 12.12. _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Each party hereto hereby (a) agrees
that any Proceeding, directly or indirectly, arising out of, under or relating
to this Agreement, any Other Transaction Documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, will be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware (and each agrees that no such Proceeding relating to this Agreement
will be brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such court), subject
to any appeal, _provided_ that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, then any such claim, suit, action or
other proceeding may be brought in any Delaware state court or any Federal
court located in the State of Delaware and (b) irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such
Proceeding. Each party hereto further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by United States registered mail to such partys
respective address set forth in Section 12.05 shall be effective service of
process for any Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters as to
which it has

 



92  submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 12.12. Each party hereto (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, any Other Transaction Documents
or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby in any court referred to in
the first sentence of this Section 12.12, (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum
and (iii) agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding brought in any
such court shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto further agrees that it will not
bring or support any action or proceeding against the Lenders in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the commitments to provide the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than any state or Federal court
located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

SECTION 12.13.  _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement, any Other Transaction
Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including with
respect to the Debt Financing or the Lenders). Each party hereto (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the Other Transaction Documents, as applicable, by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 12.13.

SECTION 12.14. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the rights and duties of the parties thereunder and
any claims or disputes arising thereunder or related thereto shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the jurisdiction
provided under the governing law provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter.

SECTION 12.15. _Waiver of Direct Claim._ Seller (on behalf of itself and any
of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) hereby (i) waives any rights or claims
against any Lender in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the Debt Commitment Letter, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and (ii) agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to
dismiss or otherwise terminate) any Proceeding against any Lender in
connection with this Agreement or the Acquisition (including any Proceeding
relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter); _provided_
that for the

 



93  avoidance of doubt this Section 12.15 shall not affect or diminish in any
respect Sellers rights and remedies under Section 12.11.

 



94 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of
the date first written above.
