shall be merged with and into the Company (as the absorbing company (
_HaChevra Ha 'Koletet_) in the Merger). As a result of the Merger, the

than on the fifth Business Day following the date on which each of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII _ is satisfied or, to the extent

shares or other like change with

  



    

-17-

 



    

respect to Company Shares occurring, or with a record date, on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and such adjustments to the
Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.7(b) shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or
restricted under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Company Options_.

  



  

(i) Subject to clause (ii) below, at the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not vested, shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive
a lump sum cash payment (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price
per Company Share for such Company Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the total
number of shares underlying such Company Option (the "Option Consideration"),
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
From and after the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto or arising therefrom,
except the right to receive the Option Consideration payable hereunder. If
the exercise price per Company Share for any Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled
without payment of consideration.

  



  

(ii) With respect to Company Options that are outstanding but unvested
immediately prior to cancellation of such unvested Company Options at the
Effective Time as provided herein, the vesting schedule thereof shall,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, be accelerated, such that all
outstanding Company Options held by any such Person whose employment or
engagement has not been terminated, or in respect of such employment or
engagement no termination notice has been issued by the holder or the Company,
as the case may be, to the other party, both as of the Effective Time, shall
become vested at such time.

  



  

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions and
use reasonable best efforts to take other actions that are necessary under
the Company Stock Plan and/or award agreements (including providing Company
Optionholders with notice of their rights with respect to any such Company
Options as provided herein and/or seeking such Company Optionholders'
consents, in each case to the extent required by the terms of the Company
Stock Plan or award agreements) to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.7(c)_.

  



  

(iv) The amount of cash each Company Optionholder is entitled to receive for
the Company Options held by such holder pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)(i)_ above
shall be rounded to the nearest cent ( _agora_ ) and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for all Company Options held by such holder.

  



  

(v) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plan shall terminate and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
share capital of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled.

Section 2.8 _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), Parent shall select (i) a
bank or trust company located in Israel and reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the paying agent for the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and,
in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent; and (ii) to the
extent necessary in light of the provisions of the Withholding Tax Ruling, an
information agent reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (the
"Information Agent") to assist in obtaining any requisite residency
certificate and/or other declaration for Israeli Tax withholding purposes
and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the
Information Agent in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Fund_.

  



  

(i) Not later than the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent, for payment to the holders of Company
Shares (including Company Shares issued upon exercise of Company 102 Options
("Company 102 Shares")) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , an
amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of
Company Shares become entitled under this _Article II_ (such cash amount being
referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section
2.7(a)(i).

  



  

(ii) The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Company, in NIS-denominated obligations of or
guaranteed by the Government of Israel. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
_Section 2.7(a)(i)_ , Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Paying Agent to make such payments contemplated by _Section 2.7(a)(i)_.
In the event that the Closing shall not have occurred within four (4)
Business Days following the deposit of the Exchange Fund with the Paying
Agent, then immediately upon the lapse of such period, the Paying Agent shall
return to Parent such deposited Exchange Fund, provided that the foregoing
shall not derogate from Parent's obligations under this _Section 2.8 (b)_.

  



  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger Consideration will be paid in
its nominal value, will not be linked to the consumer price index or any
other index or any foreign currency exchange rate and shall not bear any
interest of any kind.

  



  

(c) _Payment Procedures with respect to Company Shares_.

  



  

(i) Promptly following the Effective Time and in no event later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
cause the Paying

  



    

-19-

 



    

Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but excluding the registration company ( _Hevra Le
'Rishumim_) of the Company) holding a certificate or certificates (the
"Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares which were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent), (the "Letter of
Transmittal"), (B) a declaration in which the beneficial owner of Company
Shares provides certain information necessary for Parent to determine whether
any amounts need to be withheld from the Merger Consideration payable to such
beneficial owner pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in each case,
subject to the terms of the Withholding Tax Ruling, if obtained), the
Code, or any provision of state, local, Israeli or foreign Law, and/or (C)
instructions (including instructions from the Paying Agent) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_.

  



  

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with the Letter of Transmittal and the
declaration for Tax withholding purposes (and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent consistent with customary
practice), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for each Company Share represented by the Certificates so
surrendered an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ (less any
applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

  



  

(iii) The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to
this _Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. No Effective
Time Holder who is a record holder of Company Shares shall be entitled to
receive any amount held by the Paying Agent, unless such holder
surrenders its Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and an
executed Letter of Transmittal for payment in accordance with this  _Section
2.8(c)_.

  



  

(iv) Company Shareholders who hold uncertificated Company Shares (the
"Uncertificated Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time are
represented by book-entries, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount per each Uncertificated Share equal to the Merger Consideration to
which such holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_
(subject to applicable withholding, which shall be withheld by the Tel-Aviv
Stock Exchange members), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be

  



    

-20-

 



    

canceled and the Paying Agent shall transfer the Merger Consideration payable
in respect to all of the Uncertificated Shares to the Company\'s nominee
company ( _Hevra Le Rishumim_ ) in accordance with the TASE procedures at such
time (but in no event prior to the Effective Time) and such other terms as
coordinated with the TASE (if necessary) prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(v) Payments and deliveries to be made under this Agreement shall be made in
New Israeli Shekels by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such address or bank account(s) as shall be set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.8(c)_ , any Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company 102 Shares
shall be transferred by the Paying Agent, in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 2.8(c)_ (including the requirement to surrender
the Certificates and Letter of Transmittal by the 102 Trustee with respect to
such Company 102 Shares), to the 102 Trustee, for the benefit of the
beneficial owners thereof, and be released by the 102 Trustee to the
beneficial holders of such Company 102 Shares, in accordance with the
requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if
obtained.

  



  

(d) _Payment Procedures with Respect to Company Options_.

  



  

(i) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer the
aggregate Option Consideration with respect to Company Options subject
to Section 102 of the Ordinance (the "Company 102 Options"), to the 102
Trustee, on behalf of holders of Company 102 Options, in accordance with
Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained (the "102
Amounts"). The 102 Amounts shall be held in trust by the 102 Trustee pursuant
to the applicable provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Option
Tax Ruling, if obtained, and shall be released by the 102 Trustee, together
with any interest earned thereon by virtue of the investment of such amounts
by the 102 Trustee, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 102
of the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained.

  



  

(ii) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly deposit the
aggregate amount of funds payable in respect of Company Options (other than
Company 102 Options) pursuant to _Section 2.7_ with the Surviving Company (or,
if applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary) at one or more accounts
designated by the Company prior to Closing for the benefit of the holders of
Company Options (other than Company 102 Options), which amounts shall be paid
by the Surviving Company or, if applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary,
to the respective holders thereof through the Surviving Company's or, if
applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary's payroll system, subject to
applicable withholdings by the Surviving Company or, if applicable, the
relevant engaging Subsidiary, as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time.

  



  

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares represented by Certificates is not registered in the share
register of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name

  



    

-21-

 



    

the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the share register of the
Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer.

  



  

(f) _Required Withholding_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, each of Parent, its
Subsidiaries, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Company, the 102
Trustee and the Paying Agent (each a "Payor") shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement (including the
Merger Consideration and payments made pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_
(Company Options) such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Withholding Tax Ruling
and the Options Tax Ruling, if obtained, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"),
the Ordinance, or under any provision of applicable state, local, Israeli or
non-Israeli Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to withholding
of Israeli Tax, in the event any holder of record of Company Shares or
Company Options provides the Payor with a valid certificate, ruling or other
written instructions issued by the Israeli Tax Authority (the "ITA")
regarding the withholding (or exemption from withholding) of Israeli Tax from
the consideration payable in respect thereof in accordance with this Article
II or providing other instructions regarding such payments or withholding, to
the Parent's reasonable satisfaction (the "Valid Certificate"), then the
deduction and withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or any other
provision of Israeli Law or requirement, if any, from the Merger
Consideration, or the Option Consideration, as applicable, payable to such
holder of record of Company Shares, or Company Options, as applicable, shall
be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Certificate. For
such purpose the Withholding Tax Ruling and the Options Tax Ruling will
be considered a Valid Certificate provided that if the applicable ruling
requires the affirmative consent of the relevant holder, such holder
consented to join any such applicable ruling. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority (i) the
Payor shall provide the affected Person, as soon as practicable (but no later
than within fourteen (14) Business Days), with sufficient evidence regarding
such withholding, and (ii) the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Israeli Taxes, the
consideration payable to each Company Shareholder shall be retained by the
Paying Agent for the benefit of each such Company Shareholder for a period of
up to one hundred eighty (180) days from Closing or an earlier date required
in writing by such Company Shareholder or as otherwise requested by the ITA
(the "Withholding Drop Date") during which time no Payor shall make any
payments to any Company Shareholder that has not delivered to the Payor a
Valid Certificate or withhold any amounts for Israeli Taxes from the payments
deliverable to such Company Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, except as
provided below (unless Parent or Paying Agent is otherwise instructed
explicitly by the ITA) and during which time each such Company Shareholder
may obtain (or, if one already exists, present to the Paying Agent) a Valid
Certificate. If no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Withholding
Drop Date a Valid Certificate issued by the ITA is 

  



    

-22-

 



    

delivered to Payor, then, with respect to the affected Company Shareholders,
the deduction and withholding of any Israeli Taxes shall be made only in
accordance with the provisions of such Valid Certificate and the balance of
the payment that is not withheld shall be paid to such Company Shareholders
concurrently therewith subject to any non-Israeli withholding which is
applicable to the payment (if any). If any Company Shareholder (i) does not
provide Payor with or is not the subject of a Valid Certificate issued by the
ITA, by no later than five (5) Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date,
or (ii) submits a written request with Payor to release its portion of the
consideration prior to the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Valid
Certificate at or before such time, then the amount to be withheld from such
Company Shareholder's portion of the consideration shall be calculated
according to the applicable withholding rate as reasonably determined by
Parent in accordance with applicable Law (increased by interest plus linkage
differences, as defined in Section 159A of the Ordinance, for the period
between the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month following the month
during which the Effective Time occurs and the time the relevant payment is
made) as reasonably determined by Parent and the Paying Agent.

  



  

(iii) With respect to non-Israeli resident holders of Company Options or
Company Shares, who are or were engaged by any non-Israeli Subsidiary of the
Company, and were granted such securities as awards in consideration solely
for work or services performed outside of Israel, if such holders provide a
validly executed declaration in a form previously agreed by Parent and the
Company regarding their non-Israeli residence and confirmation that they were
granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services performed
outside of Israel, such payments shall not be subject to any withholding or
deduction of Israeli Tax and shall be made through the relevant Subsidiary's
payroll processing service or system.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(h) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
surrendered their Certificates representing such Company Shares for exchange
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look for
payment of the Merger Consideration, without interest, payable in respect of
the Company Shares represented by such Certificates solely to Parent, as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding the above, in any event that the Agreement will be
terminated in accordance with the provisions of _Article IX_
hereunder following a deposit of the Exchange Fund, the Paying Agent shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) return the Exchange
Fund to Parent, unless instructed in writing otherwise by Parent.

  



    

-23-

 



    

Section 2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after
the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder
of a Certificate theretofore representing any such Company Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of Company
Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
pay the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof and a reasonable and customary agreement by such holder to indemnify
and hold harmless Parent from and against any losses in connection therewith
(such affidavit to be in a form attached to the Letter of Transmittal);
__provided__ , __however__ , that the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable
sum as such Payor may direct as indemnity or to otherwise agree to provide an
indemnity reasonably acceptable to such Payor against any claim that may be
made against any Payor with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

Section 2.11 _No Interest_. No interest shall accumulate on any amount
payable in respect of any Company Shares or Company Options in connection with
the Merger.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of
the Surviving Company are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the
Company and the Company Shareholders to take all such lawful and necessary
action.

  



  

Article III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as set forth in (i) the English translation of "Chapter A- Description
of the Corporation's Operation" of the Company's annual report for the year
2019 (a copy of which is attached as _Schedule 3_ hereto) and any
other documents filed with (or furnished to) the TASE by the Company on or
after January 1, 2020 and prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each
case excluding any risk factor disclosure contained in a "risk factors"
section (other than any factual

  



    

-24-

 



    

information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" legend)
and to the extent publicly available on the TASE website, or (ii) the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent on the date of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Israel, and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease, operate or otherwise hold its
properties and assets, except where the failure to be so duly organized and
validly existing, or to have such power and authority has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material effect on the Company's business. The Company is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing (to the extent either such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary under applicable Law, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of the jurisdictions in which the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries are so qualified is set forth in
_Section 3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the articles of
association, as amended to date, of the Company (the "Charter Documents") and
the Company is not in default in the performance, observation or fulfillment
of such documents in any material respect.

voted at the Company Shareholders Meeting, provided that such majority
includes more than 50% of the Company Shares voted (not counting any absentee
votes) by shareholders that are not Merger Sub, Parent or any person or entity
holding at least 25% of the means of control of either Merger Sub or Parent,
or any person or entity acting on behalf of either Merger Sub or Parent or
any family member of, or entity controlled by, any of the foregoing (the
"Company Shareholder Approval"), to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be,
a party, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or any of
Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party, the

recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the ICL.

enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally, and (b) is subject to general principles of
equity.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Board and Shareholders Actions_.

  



  

(a) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement in compliance with the requirements of ICL and the
Charter Documents, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair

Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation_.

officers and directors to, and shall instruct and use its best efforts to
cause its and their other respective Representatives to, immediately cease any
and all existing discussions, communications or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and during the
Interim Period shall not recommence any of the foregoing.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.2(c)_ , at all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_
and the Effective Time (the "Interim Period"), the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize or permit any of their
respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate

or otherwise discuss or communicate with any Person (other than Parent, Merger

-59-

 



    

Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries on the making of, any proposal or other
communication that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Representatives of Parent or
Merger Sub) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that
the terms of this Agreement prohibit such discussions) (iv) approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger) or (v) enter into
any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Transaction. The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.2(b)_ by it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
or any of its Subsidiaries' Representatives shall be deemed a material breach
of this Agreement by the Company; _provided, however_ , that in the event of
a breach of this _Section 5.2(b)_ by a Representative that is not an officer
or director of the Company, then such breach would only be deemed material if
the violation of the restriction led to discussions with any of the
Company\'s directors or officers regarding a potential equity transaction
with the Company which may interfere with the consummation of the Merger as
contemplated hereunder (other than a response by the contacted Company
director or officer refusing to discuss any such transaction).

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof), may, directly or indirectly through the
Company's Representatives, (i) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person that has, in the absence of any material
violation of _Section 5.2(b)_ by the Company, made a _bona fide_ , written
and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and that the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, either constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and/or (ii) furnish to
any Person that has, in the absence of any material violation of _Section
5.2(b)_ by the Company, made an Acquisition Proposal of the type referred to
clause (i), any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or afford to any Person that has, in the absence of any
material violation of _Section 5.2(b)_ by the Company, made such an
Acquisition Proposal access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under this clause (ii)
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to the
Company, in the aggregate, than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding
clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under applicable Law, (B)
promptly thereafter, but no later than forty eight (48) hours following such
determination, the Company shall give Parent written notice of the identity of
such Person and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal including any
modifications thereto (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form,
in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof including any
modifications thereto) and of the Company's intention to participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information
to, such Person, and shall in no event begin providing such information to
such Person prior to providing such notice to the Parent, and (C) as soon as
reasonably practicable after furnishing any non-public information about the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person (and in any event within forty
eight (48) hours thereafter), the

  



    

-60-

 



    

Company shall furnish such non-public information to Parent to the extent
such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent.

  



  

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.2(b)_ , the Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty eight
(48) hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company becomes aware of the
receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or
which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (unless
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry is in written form, in which
case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof), and the identity of the
Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The
Company shall keep Parent fully informed of any material changes in status
and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry on a current
basis, and in any event no later than forty eight (48) hours after the
occurrence of any material changes to any such Acquisition Proposal (including
to the terms and conditions thereof and of any material modification
thereto), and any significant developments in the discussions and negotiations
concerning any such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that would restrict the Company's ability to provide to Parent the information
described in this _Section 5.2_ , and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently a party to any agreement that prohibits the
Company from providing the information described in this _Section 5.2_ to the
Parent. The Company (A) except to the extent inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of directors under applicable Law, shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify, or grant permission
under, any standstill provision in any confidentiality agreement to which it
or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a party (other than as occurs in
accordance with the terms of any such standstill provision in effect as of
the date hereof), and (B) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such standstill provisions if it
becomes aware of any breach of any such standstill provision by the party
subject thereto.

  



  

(f) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement) (i) demand that each individual or
entity that has executed a confidentiality agreement in the preceding eighteen
(18) months in connection with any potential Acquisition Proposal return (or
destroy, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement) all confidential information furnished to such
individual or entity by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement, and (ii) revoke or withdraw access of any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives) to any data room (virtual or
actual) containing any non-public information with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

Section 5.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.3, the Company Board
shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares approve this Agreement and
the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation").

  



  

(b) Other than in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.3, the Company
Board shall not (i) withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
in any material respect, or publicly propose to withdraw, amend or modify, in
each case, in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect, the Company
Board Recommendation, or publicly propose to withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company Board
Recommendation, or make any statement, filing or release inconsistent with
the Company Board Recommendation or fail to reaffirm its approval of this
Agreement or the Merger as promptly as practicable after receipt of any
reasonable written request to do so from Parent (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days) _,_ (ii) approve or recommend or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as a "Company Board Recommendation
Change"), or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 5.2(c)_ entered into in the circumstances
referred to in _Section 5.2(c)_ ) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").
The Company shall, within twenty four (24) hours following a determination by
the Company Board (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, notify Parent in writing of such determination.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may (x)
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or (y) if it elects to do so
in connection with or following a Company Board Recommendation Change,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ in order to enter into
a written definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in each
case, only if (i) the Company receives an unsolicited written, _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal from a third party, which is not withdrawn
(provided that the making of such Acquisition Proposal by the third party is
not in violation of such third party's standstill obligations to the Company
(if any)), (ii) a material breach by the Company of _Section 5.2_ or this
_Section 5.3_ has not contributed to the making of such Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may have
been offered by Parent prior to the determination by the Company Board (or
any committee thereof); (iv) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(f)_ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the

  



    

-62-

 



    

fiduciary duties of the directors under applicable Law; (v) the Company has
notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement in respect of such
Superior Proposal, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Company Board Recommendation Change and/or termination (a "Recommendation
Change Notice"), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the
proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the Recommendation Change Notice and
any amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver
such notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall
not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement); (vi) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss with Parent's Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the three (3) Business-Day period immediately following the delivery
by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice (the "Re-
Negotiation Period"); and (vii) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company
a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the
Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement within the
three (3) Business-Day period following the lapse of the Re-Negotiation
Period, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ would still reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of its directors under applicable
Law; __provided_ , _however__ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(c), and any purported termination
pursuant to this Section 5.3(c) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless in advance of or substantially concurrently with such termination the
Company (1) pays the Parent the Termination Fee required by and pursuant to
the terms of _Section 9.3(b)(i)_ , and (2) following such termination
enters into a binding definitive contract for such Superior Proposal. In the
event of any material revisions to the terms of the Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new Recommendation Change Notice to the
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3_ with respect
to such new Recommendation Change Notice, and the Re-Negotiation Period
referred to in clause (vi) shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the date
of such new notice.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position contemplated by
Section 329 of the ICL, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company
Shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the
failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or would
reasonably likely conflict with or violate any applicable Law or the rules or
requirements of the TASE; _provided_ that, in either such case, any such
statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company Board will be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of _Article
X_.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall,

  



    

-63-

 



    

and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of
the Company and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent and its Representatives any
information concerning its business, Taxes, properties or personnel
(including employment terms, manuals, handbooks, policies and guidelines) as
Parent may reasonably request to prepare for the Closing or the post-Closing
integration, including and subject to the foregoing (a) any report, schedule
and other document filed or furnished by it with the ISA and any material
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
ISA in respect of such filings, and (b) internal monthly consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent
prepared in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable
Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information would
give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information, or (iii) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
under, or give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate the rights
under, such Contract; and provided further, that no information or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 5.4 _ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the first proviso in the preceding sentence, it
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable
information to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law,
Contract or obligation or to waive such a privilege. Parent and its
Representatives shall have the right to consult on a regular basis with each
of the members of the Company's senior management team, in each case, so that
Parent and Merger Sub may obtain all information concerning the business,
assets or affairs of the Company as they may reasonably need to prepare for
the Closing or the post-Closing integration. Subject to compliance with
applicable Law, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall confer from time to
time as requested by Parent with Parent or its Representatives to discuss any
material changes or developments in the operational matters of the Company and
the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company, as may be
reasonably necessary to prepare for the Closing or the post-Closing
integration. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated
by this _Section 5.4_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Company's
properties shall be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform
invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its
Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 5.4_.

Section 5.5 _Certain Litigation_ (a) . Each party hereto shall promptly
advise the other parties hereto of any Legal Proceedings commenced after the
date hereof or, to its Knowledge, threatened in writing against such party or
any of its directors, officers (in their capacity as such) or
controlled Affiliates by any Company Shareholders (on their own behalf or on
behalf of the Company), before any court or other Governmental Authority,
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. Each party hereto shall give the other parties hereto the
opportunity to consult with such party regarding the defense or settlement of
any such shareholder litigation and shall consider such other parties' views
in good faith with respect to such shareholder litigation; provided that
Parent shall also have the right to participate in the defense of any such
Legal Proceedings to the extent permissible or not prohibited under applicable
Law. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or make an offer to settle
any Legal Proceedings commenced against the Company or any director or
officer thereof by any shareholder relating to this Agreement or the Merger,
without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  



  

Section 5.6 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, except as
otherwise may be agreed by Parent, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain resignation letters from each of the members of the board
of directors of the Company (such letters shall be substantially in the form
attached as _Section 5.6_ hereto), in each case with the resignation to be
effective as of the Effective Time, together with any supporting document
required for registering such resignation with the relevant government office,
as applicable.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Replacement of Subsidiaries ' Directors_. If, during the
Interim Period or with effect of the Effective Time, any director of a
Subsidiary (i) resigns, passes away or for any other reason ceases to be a
member of the respective board of directors, or (ii) prior to the Effective
Time declares his/her resignation, or his/her intention to resign, with
effect as of the Closing Date or following the Closing Date, the Company,
to the extent it is permitted by and able under applicable laws, shall
exercise its voting and other rights as a shareholder and/or (to the extent
legally permissible) instruct the remaining board members of its Subsidiaries,
to cause the relevant Subsidiary and its board, to take all measures to
replace the respective director(s) (including by coopting such directors) as
soon as reasonably possible after the Closing Date, with a view to
maintaining on such board at all times a majority of Company representatives
or nominees.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_. The Parties agree to certain arrangements
with respect to Covered Employees as defined and specified in _Exhibit 5.8_
hereto.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Cooperation in Future Financings_

  



  

(a) To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall (subject
to applicable law) cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, in each case at Parent's
sole expense, provide to Parent and Merger Sub reasonable cooperation
requested by Parent and Merger Sub that is reasonably required in connection
with any potential financing of Parent with respect to the consideration
payable in

  



    

-65-

Parent's request, furnishing Parent and its potential providers of financing

failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, if and only to the extent that such
failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the

Section 10.3 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties, except that each of Merger Sub and Parent may
assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Company, any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate
thereof (each, an "Assignee"). Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in
its sole discretion and without the consent of the Company, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional
Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with any assignment to
an Assignee or by such Assignee to its additional Assignees, Parent and Merger
Sub shall remain liable for the performance by any such Assignees of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
(i) be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Annexes hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; _provided, however,_ the Confidentiality Agreement
shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement
expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties
thereto. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, MERGER SUB OR ANY OF
THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE
ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE)
BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

  



    

-86-

 



    

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE
TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

  



  

Section 10.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to,
and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 10.12_ , (b) the right of the Company to pursue
damages (including in respect of the damages caused to its shareholders) in
the event Parent and/or Merger Sub do not consummate the Merger in breach of
this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub,
and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of Company
Shares and other Company Securities to receive the amounts to which they are
entitled pursuant to _Article II_.

  



  

Section 10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. Each party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy.

Section 10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute, controversy or
claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution, existence, validity, enforceability or performance of
this Agreement, or for the breach or alleged breach hereof (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Israel, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule that would
cause the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that any actions or proceedings
arising in connection with any dispute, controversy or claim arising under,
relating to or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any dispute or controversy regarding the
existence, validity, enforceability or breach of this Agreement), whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be brought, tried and determined only
in any court of competent jurisdiction located in Tel Aviv-Jaffa,
Israel; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and
its properties and assets to the jurisdiction of any court located in Tel
Aviv-Jaffa, Israel in the event of any such action or proceeding; (iii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action
or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought
in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (v)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in
any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in any manner permitted to
provide notices in accordance with _Section 10.2_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 10.9_ shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto
agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding section or
subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and
warranties of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the
case of this clause (ii) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and
warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become

  



    

-88-

 



    

effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic
delivery (including, without limitation, in pdf, DocuSign or other scan
format) shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto acknowledges and irrevocably
agrees that the entities that have committed to provide or otherwise entered
into agreements in connection with the Debt Financing (as defined below),
including any commitment letters, joinder agreements, credit agreements (or
similar definitive financing documents) relating thereto, together with their
respective Affiliates and Representative (collectively, the "Debt Financing
Sources") shall not have any liability or obligations (whether based in
contract, tort, fraud, strict liability or otherwise) to the Company,
its Subsidiaries, its Representatives or the Affiliates of the foregoing
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any potential debt financing
to be provided or arranged by the Debt Financing Sources in connection with
this Agreement (the "Debt Financing"). It is also hereby agreed that in no
event will the Company, its Subsidiaries, its Representatives or
the Affiliates of the foregoing be entitled to specific performance of any
commitment letter or similar agreement entered into by Parent for any Debt
Financing against the Debt Financing Sources providing such Debt Financing.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree (i) that any
legal action or proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise against any Debt Financing Source arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the performance hereunder shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City and State of New York (whether a state or a
federal Court), and any appellate court from thereof, (ii) that any legal
action or proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, (iii) not
to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such legal action in any other court, (iv) that each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury
in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby involving any of the Debt Financing
Sources and (v) that the Debt Financing Sources are express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.12_ (and any other provision of this
Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other
modification of such provision would modify the substance of this Section) and
this _Section 10.12_ and such provisions shall not be amended in any way
materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 10.12_ shall constitute a financing condition to the
consummation of the Merger.
