 **A.** The boards of directors of the Company and Acquiror have determined
that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies
and their shareholders to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to
which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
merge with and into Acquiror (the " **Merger** "), with Acquiror as the

 **AGREEMENTS**

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises,
covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 1.1** _The Merger_. Provided that this Agreement shall not prior
thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, upon the
terms and subject to the

      
 

 



 

conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the IBCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into
Acquiror pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the
IBCA, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquiror
will be the Surviving Entity.

 



 

 **Section 1.2** _Effective Time; Closing_.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated
in accordance with its express terms, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually
acceptable to Acquiror and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the
offices of Shapiro Bieging Barber Otteson LLP, located at 7979 East Tufts
Avenue, Suite 1600, Denver, Colorado 80237, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the
first day of the month immediately following the month in which the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in **Article 8** and **Article
9** (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) or at such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company may
agree in writing (the " **Closing Date** ").

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree to file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Iowa on the Closing Date articles of merger containing such information as
is required by the relevant provisions of the IBCA (the " **Iowa Articles of
Merger** "). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time
specified in the Iowa Articles of Merger (the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

 **Section 1.3** _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the Iowa Articles of Merger and the IBCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

 **Section 1.4** _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity_. The
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **Section 1.5** _Directors and Officers_. Subject to the appointment of the
additional directors as contemplated in **Section 6.6**, the directors of
Acquiror immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Entity and shall hold office until their respective
successors and assigns are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal. The officers of Acquiror immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Entity, each to
hold office until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Entitys articles of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

 **Section 1.6** _Bank Mergers_. Immediately following the Effective Time, or
at such later time as Acquiror may determine in its sole discretion, (a) Bank
A will merge with and into Acquiror Bank; and (b) Bank B will merge with and
into Acquiror Bank (collectively, the

 



      
 

 



 

" **Bank Mergers** "), in each case pursuant to an agreement and plan of
merger to be agreed upon by Acquiror and the Company and executed prior to the
Closing Date, which agreement shall be in form and substance customary for
mergers similar to the Bank Mergers. Acquiror Bank shall be the surviving
entity in the Bank Mergers and, following each Bank Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the applicable Bank shall cease. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause each of Bank A and Bank B, and Acquiror shall
cause Acquiror Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of merger and
such other documents and certificates as are necessary to effectuate the Bank
Mergers (collectively, the " **Bank Merger Certificates** ").

 



 

 **Section 1.7** _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties
may mutually agree to change the method of effecting the Contemplated
Transactions if and to the extent that they deem such a change to be
desirable; _provided, that_ : (a) any such change shall not affect the U.S.
federal income Tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common
Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of
the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as
consideration in the Merger; (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of
the Merger; or (iii) require submission to or approval of the Companys
shareholders after the Merger has been approved by the Companys shareholders.
If the parties agree to make such a change, they shall execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 2.1** _Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, the Company or any
holder of Company Common Stock:

 



 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares or Dissenters
Shares) shall, subject to **Section 2.5**, be converted in the right to
receive, without interest, the following consideration:

 



 

(i) $992.51 (the " **Per Share Cash Consideration** "); and

 



 

(ii) 117.5500 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock
(the " **Per Share Stock Consideration** " and, together with the Per Share
Cash Consideration, the " **Per Share Merger Consideration** ").

 



 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, shares of
Acquiror Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment, or if a stock dividend on shares of Acquiror Common Stock
shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued to holders of Company Common Stock at
the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement will be appropriately and
proportionally adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.2** _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares
of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically
be cancelled and will cease to exist. Certificates (it being understood that
any reference herein to a "certificate" shall be deemed to include reference
to any book-entry account statement relating to the ownership of Company
Common Stock) that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenters Shares) will be deemed for all
purposes to represent only the right to receive, upon proper surrender thereof
in accordance with **Section 2.4**, (a) the Per Share Merger Consideration;
(b) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such certificate have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.3**, without interest
thereon; and (c) any dividends or distributions that the holder thereof has
the right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.4(g)**. Notwithstanding anything
in **Section 2.1** to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of
the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in the Companys treasury
or otherwise owned by Acquiror or the Company (in each case other than shares
of Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit Plan or related trust
accounts that, in each case, are beneficially owned by third Persons, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) will be cancelled and no shares of Acquiror Common
Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor (such
cancelled shares, the " **Cancelled Shares** ").

 



 

 **Section 2.3** _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock shall be issued as Per Share Stock Consideration in the Merger. Each
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this **Article 2**
shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest)
rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Closing
Acquiror Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock
to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, LLC shall serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent
agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "
**Exchange Agent** "); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent
agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Acquiror shall be solely
responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance
of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this **Article
2**: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for payment of
the Per Share Stock Consideration pursuant to **Section 2.1**; (ii)
sufficient cash for payment of the Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to
**Section 2.1**; and (iii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with **Section
2.3**. Such amount of cash and shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective
Time, are referred to in this **Article 2** as the " **Conversion Fund.** "

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Entity
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (" **Company Stock
Certificates** ") a letter of transmittal (" **Letter of Transmittal** "), in
a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among other things, that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Per Share Merger Consideration
plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in
accordance with **Section 2.3** deliverable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon
such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration
deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time,
for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, (i) the Per
Share Merger Consideration; (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock that the shareholder has a right to receive pursuant to
**Section 2.3**; and (iii) any dividends or distributions that the
shareholder has a right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.4(g)**, in each
case, upon the proper surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
**Article 2**.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
the Company, the (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration; (ii) cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the shareholder has a
right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.3**; and (iii) any dividends or
distributions that the shareholder has a right to receive pursuant to
**Section 2.4(g)** shall be delivered pursuant to **Section 2.4(d)**,
without interest thereon, in exchange therefor to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate and establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Entity that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Entitys Affiliates shall be
entitled to deduct or withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from the
Per Share Merger Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Entity or the Surviving Entitys applicable Affiliate, as the case may be, is
required to deduct or withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent the amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable
Tax authorities, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Person in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration; (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the shareholder has a right to
receive pursuant to **Section 2.3**, without interest thereon; and (iii) any
dividends or distributions that the shareholder has a right to receive
pursuant to **Section 2.4(g)**, in each case, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this **Article 2**.

 



 

(g) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror
Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this **Article 2**. Promptly after the
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this **Article
2**, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to **Section 2.1**. No holder of an
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender
of such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this **Article 2**, to
vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which such holders Company
Common Stock shall have been converted.

 



 

(h) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
**Article 2** shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its
successors in interest, for (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration; (ii) cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the shareholder
has a right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.3**; and (iii) any dividends
or distributions that the shareholder has a right to receive pursuant to
**Section 2.4(g)**, each without interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(i) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Entity with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate, and in accordance with this **Article 2**, (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration; (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock that the shareholder has a right to receive pursuant to **Section
2.3**; and (iii) any dividends or distributions that the shareholder has a
right to receive pursuant to **Section 2.4(g)**, each without interest
thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Acquiror or the Surviving
Entity and the Exchange Agent with respect to the payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock, the Surviving Entity, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion,
shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of any Letter of
Transmittal and compliance by any Company shareholder with the procedures and
instructions set forth herein and therein; and (ii) the method of payment of
the Per Share Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock.

 



 

(k) In the case of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that are not
represented by Certificates, the parties shall make such adjustments to this
**Article 2** as are necessary or appropriate to implement the same purpose
and effect that this **Article 2** has with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock that are represented by Certificates.

 



 

 **Section 2.5** _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
shareholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has the right to demand and who properly shall have
demanded payment of the fair value for such shares in accordance in all
respects with the IBCA (collectively, the " **Dissenters  Shares**") shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Such shareholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment
of the fair value of such shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of the IBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenters Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and such shareholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights provided for pursuant to the provisions of
the IBCA and this **Section 2.5**), except that all Dissenters Shares held
by shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights as dissenting shareholders under the
IBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the Per Share Merger Consideration upon surrender in the
manner provided in **Section 2.4** of the certificate(s) that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, evidenced such shares. The Company shall give
Acquiror: (a) prompt notice of any written demands for payment of fair value
of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the IBCA and received by the
Company relating to shareholders dissenters rights; and (b) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
under the IBCA consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, (i) make
any payment with respect to such demand; (ii) offer or agree to settle or
settle any demand for payment of fair value; or (iii) waive any failure to
timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair value or timely take any
other action to perfect payment of fair value rights in accordance with the
IBCA. Any portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, or any
other consideration, made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
**Section 2.5** to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which
dissenters rights have been perfected shall be returned to Acquiror upon
demand.

standing in each other jurisdiction in which the nature of the business

fair and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The
Company Board has adopted a resolution directing the Merger, on substantially
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, be submitted to the
Companys shareholders for consideration at a duly held meeting of such

terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

generally and subject to general principles of equity.

 



 

 **Section 3.4** _No Conflict_. Neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated
Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of
time): (a) assuming receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, contravene,

incorporation, certificate of formation or charter (or similar organizational

hereof, or any currently effective resolution adopted by the board of
directors, shareholders, manager or members of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (b) assuming receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any Legal Requirement or
any Order to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement, contract or other instrument or obligation to which Company

respective properties, assets or business activities may be bound or affected,
except (in case of clause (c)) for such contraventions, conflicts, breaches or

unconsolidated Affiliate, on the other hand), including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (for reference, as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract or agreement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving or material liabilities of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in the Company Financial

other Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction over the Company or its
Subsidiaries and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in

all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at

meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law) for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and for
income Tax purposes in each other jurisdiction which recognizes such status

 **Section 3.12** _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) **Section 3.12(a)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules includes a
complete and correct list of each Company Benefit Plan. The Company has
delivered or made available to Acquiror true and complete copies of the
following with respect to each Company Benefit Plan: (i) a copy of the
Companys current employee policy manual; (ii) copies of each Company Benefit
Plan (or a written description where no formal plan document exists), and all
related plan descriptions and other material written communications provided
to participants of Company Benefit Plans; (iii) to the extent applicable, the
last three (3) years annual reports on Form 5500, including all schedules
thereto and the opinions of independent accountants; and (iv) other ancillary
documents including the following documents related to each Company Benefit
Plan:

 



 

(i) all Contracts with third party administrators, actuaries, investment
managers, consultants, insurers, and independent contractors;

 



 

(ii) all notices and other written communications that were given by the
Company, any Subsidiary, or any Company Benefit Plan to the IRS, the DOL or
the PBGC pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements within the six (6) years
preceding the date of this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) all notices or other written communications that were given by the IRS,
the PBGC, or the DOL to the Company, any Subsidiary, or any Company Benefit
Plan within the six (6) years preceding the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in **Section 3.12(b)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible
terminations of employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment,
vesting, increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under
any Company Benefit Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of the
Company or any Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan provides
for payment of any amount

 



      
 

 



 

which, considered in the aggregate with amounts payable pursuant to all other
Company Benefit Plans, would, to the extent paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, result in any amount being non-
deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or 162(m)
of the Code.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth on **Section 3.12(c)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate sponsors,
maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained,
administered or contributed to, or has, has had or, could have any liability
with respect to, (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA); (ii) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA); or (iii) any self-insured plan (including any plan
pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect to any
Company Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in
Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional
employer organization, such Company Benefit Plan complies in all respects with
the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither the Company nor any of the
Company ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or
remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled
individuals. Neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any
liability with respect to, any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any Tax-qualified
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Company
Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued
liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

 



 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter, or, in the case of a volume submitter or prototype plan, an advisory
or sponsor letter, from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under
the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section
501 of the Code (or the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on
an opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and there are no facts or
circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any Company
Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related trust.

 



 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan is, and has been administered in all material
respects in, compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of
Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company
Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of
any Company Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or
federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related
agreement.

 



 

(g) No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or, to the Companys Knowledge, any
other Person has, or has had, any liability to any Company Benefit Plan
participant, beneficiary or any other Person under any provisions of ERISA or
any other applicable Legal Requirement by reason of any action or failure to
act in connection with any Company Benefit Plan, including any liability by
any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts
or

 



       
 

 



 

by reason of any credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights.
No disqualified person (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company
Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction (as described
in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 



 

(h) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by the Company or
any Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan (i) through the date hereof have
been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set aside therefor
and reflected in Company Financial Statements; and (ii) through the Closing
Date will have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes will have been
set aside therefore and reflected in the Company Financial Statements.

 



 

(i) Except as disclosed on **Section 3.12(i)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, there are no obligations under any Company Benefit Plans to provide
health or other welfare benefits to retirees or other former employees,
directors, consultants or their dependents (other than rights under Section
4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA or comparable state laws).

 



 

(j) No event has occurred or circumstance exists that could result in an
increase in premium costs of Company Benefit Plans or an increase in benefit
costs of such Company Benefit Plans that are self-insured as compared to the
Companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 except for annual increases in
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

(k) No condition exists as a result of which the Company or any Subsidiary
would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company
Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a Person performing
services for the Company or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather
than as an employee. All individuals participating in Company Benefit Plans
are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in such Company Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to
employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Company Benefit
Plans.

 



 

(m) No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan fiduciary has engaged in
any transaction involving Company Common Stock with respect to which a selling
shareholder has made an election under Code Section 1042 and the Company has
consented under Code Section 1042 to the application of Code Sections 4978 and
4979A.

 



 

(n) Except as disclosed on **Section 3.12(n)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, each Company Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued as of the Closing Date in accordance with its terms without any
liability to Acquiror or to Acquiror ERISA Affiliates.

 



 

 **Section 3.13** _Compliance with Legal Requirements_. The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, variances,
registrations, permits, franchises, rights and other authorizations from all
appropriate Regulatory Authorities or other third parties necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is, and at all times since December 31, 2015, has been, in
material compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was applicable to
it or to the conduct or

 



      
 

 



 

operation of its respective businesses or the ownership or use of any of its
respective assets, except where noncompliance would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any time since
December 31, 2015, any notice or other communication (whether oral or written)
from any Regulatory Authority or, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, any other Person, regarding: (a) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement; or
(b) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential obligation on the part of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake, or to bear all or any portion
of the cost of, any remedial action of any nature in connection with a failure
to comply with any Legal Requirement. The Company and each insured depository
Subsidiary of the Company is "well-capitalized" (as such term is defined in

such underwriters have reserved their rights. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has had any insurance policy or bond cancelled or nonrenewed
by the issuer of the policy or bond within the past three (3) years.

 



 

 **Section 3.19** _Compliance with Environmental Laws_. There are no actions,
suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that
are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor to the
Knowledge of the Company is there any factual basis for any of the foregoing,
as a result of any asserted failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of, or any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental Law. No
environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required for the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions that have not been received.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any interest
in real estate on which any substances have been generated, used, stored,
deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known to be
present on, at or under such property, would require notification to any
Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under
any Environmental Law at such property given the current use of the property
or any impacted adjacent or down gradient property, except where such action
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except for any matters that are not, and would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company and
each Subsidiary of the Company has complied in all respects with all
Environmental Laws applicable to it and its business operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all representations and warranties in this

**Section 3.20 **of the Company Disclosure Schedules, no officer or director

any Company Loan or any other agreement with the Company or any of its

mixed, tangible or intangible, used in or pertaining to, the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions
or other similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 3.22** _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
would be denied or unduly delayed. The Banks most recent CRA ratings were
"satisfactory" or better.

Act of 1935) or seeking to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment is

Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board,
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Regulatory Authority.

Company, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated
or violated any intellectual property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

 **Section 3.25** _Investments_.

 



 

(a) **Section 3.25(a)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules includes a
complete and correct list and description as of July 31, 2018, of: (i) all
investment and debt securities, mortgage-backed and related securities,
marketable equity securities and securities purchased under agreements to

any such securities owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries after July 31,
2018, the " **Company Investment Securities** "); and (ii) any such Company
Investment Securities that are pledged as collateral to another Person. The

Securities are pledged in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with
prudent banking practices, to secure obligations of the Company or the Bank.

the Banks in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(b) Except as may be imposed by applicable securities laws and restrictions
that may exist for Company Investment Securities that are classified as "held
to maturity," none of securities held by the Company is subject to any
restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that impairs the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of such investment at any time.
With respect to all repurchase agreements to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company, as the
case may be, has a valid, perfected first Lien in the securities or other
collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of the
collateral securing each such repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the
amount of the debt secured by such collateral under such agreement.

 



 

(c) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has sold or otherwise disposed of
any Company Investment Securities held by them in a transaction in which the
acquiror of such Company Investment Securities or other Person has the right,
either conditionally or absolutely, to require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such Company Investment
Securities.

 



 

(d) All Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the account of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of the

Legal Requirements of applicable Regulatory Authorities and in accordance with
the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
with counterparties believed at the time to be financially responsible and
able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and
to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of such Derivative
Transactions are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except
as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to
general principles of equity), and are in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have duly performed
their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued and there are no breaches, violations or
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. The
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
under or with respect to each such Derivative Transactions has been reflected
in the books and records of the Company and such Subsidiaries in accordance
with GAAP.

administered all accounts for which it acts as fiduciary, including accounts

Company, the Banks, nor any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are
true and correct in all respects and accurately reflect the assets of such
fiduciary account.

 **Section 3.30** _Indemnification_. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
action or failure to take action by any present or former director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has occurred
which would give rise to a material

 



      
 

 



 

claim by any such individual for indemnification from the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

 **Section 3.31** _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received

respective filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except

other Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction over

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror or its Subsidiaries and has paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except to the extent the failure to file such
forms, reports, registrations and other documents or pay such fees or
assessments would not reasonably be expected to be material to Acquiror or its

all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed

personal, tangible or intangible, that it purports to own, except for OREO, or
lease, subject to no Liens of any kind except: (a) as noted in the most recent
Acquiror Financial Statements or as set forth in **Section 4.8(a)** of the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedules; (b) statutory Liens for Taxes not yet
delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for
which adequate reserves have been established and reflected in the Acquiror
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP; (c) Liens required to be granted
in connection with the acceptance of government deposits, granted in
connection with repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements, securing any
discount with, borrowing from, or obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or
Federal Home Loan Bank, interbank credit facilities or any transaction by
Acquiror Bank acting in a fiduciary capacity that, in each case, were incurred
in the Ordinary Course of Business and are set forth on **Section 4.8(c)** of
the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules; (d) easements, rights of way, and other
similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the value or use of the
properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair the business operations at such properties; (e) minor
defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances that do not materially
impair the value or use thereof or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties; (f) with respect to personal property, Liens or
deposits in connection with workers compensation, unemployment insurance,
social security or other insurance; (g) inchoate mechanics and materialmens
Liens for construction in progress and workmens, repairmens, warehousemens
and carriers Liens in each case arising in the Ordinary Course of Business of
Acquiror, the payment of which is not yet delinquent; and (i) Liens on
property required by Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve. Acquiror
and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee (i) has the right under valid and
existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the
respective property leased by it; (ii) is in sole possession of the properties
purported to be leased thereunder, subject to the terms of the leases,
subleases, licenses or other contracts (including all amendments,
modifications and supplements thereto); and (iii), and each such lease is
valid and binding on Acquiror or its applicable Subsidiary and is in full
force and effect without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge
of Acquiror, the lessor. All buildings and structures owned by Acquiror and
each of its Subsidiaries lie wholly within the boundaries of the real property
owned or validly leased by it, and do not encroach upon the property of, or
otherwise conflict with the property

 



      
 

 



 

rights of, any other Person. Since December 31, 2017, none of Acquirors or
its Subsidiaries real property, whether owned or leased, has been taken by
eminent domain (or to the Knowledge of Acquiror is the subject of a pending or
contemplated taking which has not been consummated).

 



 

 **Section 4.9** _Loan Loss Reserve_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the
Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Acquiror Banks continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by
Acquiror Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or
extension thereof (the " **Acquiror Loans** ") under the requirements of GAAP
and Legal Requirements, was established in a manner consistent with Acquiror
Banks internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank,
was adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all
Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of
recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding
Acquiror Loans.

 



 

(b) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to
any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances
in excess of Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on
past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except
as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off.

 



 

 **Section 4.10** _Compliance with Legal Requirements_. Acquiror and each of
its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, variances,
registrations, permits, franchises, rights and other authorizations from all
appropriate Regulatory Authorities or other third parties necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses. Acquiror and each of its
Subsidiaries is, and at all times since December 31, 2015, has been, in
material compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was applicable to
it or to the conduct or operation of its respective businesses or the
ownership or use of any of its respective assets (including Environmental Laws
but only respect to real property that does not constitute OREO), except where
noncompliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to Acquiror. Neither Acquiror nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received, at any time since December 31, 2015, any notice or
other communication (whether oral or written) from any Regulatory Authority or
any other Person regarding: (a) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential
violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement; or (b) any
actual, alleged, possible, or potential obligation on the part of Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries to undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the
cost of, any remedial action of any nature in connection with a failure to
comply with any Legal Requirement. Acquiror and each insured depository
Subsidiary of Acquiror is "well-capitalized" (as such term is defined in the
relevant regulation of the institutions primary federal bank regulator), and
the institutions rating under the CRA is no less than "satisfactory."

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 4.11** _Legal Proceedings; Orders_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on **Section 4.11(a)** of the Acquiror Disclosure
Schedules, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, Proceedings
against Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no Order imposed on
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to be
material to Acquiror and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No officer,
director, employee or agent of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to any Order that prohibits such officer, director, employee or agent from
engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or practice relating to the
businesses of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

 



 

(b) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) is subject to any cease
and desist or other Order or enforcement action issued by; (ii) is a party to
any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with;
(iii) is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to; (iv) is
subject to any Order or directive by; (v) is subject to any supervisory letter
from; (vi) has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty, which has not been
paid, by; or (vii) has adopted any Regulatory Agreement at the request of any
Regulatory Authority that restricts in any material respect the conduct of its
business, in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, restricts its ability
to pay dividends or interest, or relates to, or limits in any material manner
its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business. To the
Knowledge of Acquiror, since December 31, 2015, none of the foregoing is
pending or has been threatened by any Regulatory Authority, and, to Acquirors
Knowledge, no such Regulatory Authority is considering issuing any such
Regulatory Agreement or has threatened the commencement of any regulatory
investigation.

 



 

(c) None of Acquiror, any Subsidiary of Acquiror or, to Acquirors Knowledge,
any of their respective Representatives has, directly or indirectly: (i) used
any funds of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror for any unlawful
contribution, unlawful gift or unlawful entertainment or other expense
relating to political activity; (ii) made any unlawful payment to any foreign
or domestic governmental official or employee or to any foreign or domestic
political party or campaign from funds of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of
Acquiror; (iii) violated any provision that would result in the violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or any similar law; (iv) established
or maintained any unlawful fund of monies or other assets of Acquiror or any
Subsidiary of Acquiror; (v) made any fraudulent entry on the books or records
of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror; or (vi) made any unlawful bribe,
unlawful rebate, unlawful payoff, unlawful influence payment, unlawful
kickback or other unlawful payment to any Person, private or public,
regardless of form, whether in money, property or services, to obtain
favorable treatment in securing business or to obtain special concessions for
Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror or any of their Affiliates, to pay for
favorable treatment for business secured or to pay for special concessions
already obtained for Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror, or is currently
subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury.

 



 

(d) **Section 4.11(d)** of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules lists each
Proceeding which is pending on the date of this Agreement, or that has been
settled in the past three (3) years against Acquiror or any Subsidiary of
Acquiror, any present or former officer,

 



       
 

 



 

director or employee of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (relating to
their capacity as such).

 



 

 **Section 4.12** _Absence of Certain Changes and Events_. Since December 31,
2017, no event or events have occurred that had or would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror.

 



 

 **Section 4.13** _Brokerage Commissions_. Except for fees payable to Piper
Jaffray and Co. pursuant to an engagement letter that has been Previously
Disclosed, none of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, has incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or
otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or other
similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.14** _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there is
no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals would
be denied or unduly delayed. Acquiror Banks most recent CRA rating was
"satisfactory" or better.

 



 

 **Section 4.15** _Financial Capability_. Acquiror has, or will have prior to
the Effective Time, sufficient funds to pay the cash component of the Per
Share Merger Consideration and to perform its other obligations contemplated
by this Agreement. Acquiror has reserved for issuance the requisite number of
shares to satisfy the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

 **Section 4.16** _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Acquiror has received the
opinion of Piper Jaffray and Co., financial advisor to Acquiror, to the effect
that, as of the date of such opinion, the aggregate consideration to be paid
by Acquiror in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Acquiror.

 



 

 **Section 4.17** _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this
**Article 4**, neither Acquiror nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Acquiror, its Subsidiaries,
or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions
(financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Acquiror hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, except for the representations and warranties made by
Acquiror in this **Article 4**, neither Acquiror nor any other Person makes
or has made any representation or warranty to the Company or any of its
Affiliates or representatives with respect to any oral or written information
presented to the Company or any of its Affiliates or representatives in the
course of their due diligence investigation of Acquiror, the negotiation of
this Agreement or in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other
Person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty
other than those contained in **Article 3**.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 
THE COMPANYS COVENANTS**

 



 

 **Section 5.1** _Access and Investigation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, Acquiror and its
Representatives shall, at all times during normal business hours and with
reasonable advance notice, have such reasonable access to the facilities,
operations, records and properties of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
in accordance with the provisions of this **Section 5.1(a)** as shall be
necessary for the purpose of determining the Companys continued compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and preparing for the
integration of Acquiror and the Company following the Effective Time. Acquiror
and its Representatives may, during such period, make or cause to be made such
reasonable investigation of the operations, records and properties of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and
legal conditions as Acquiror shall deem necessary or advisable to familiarize
itself with such records, properties and other matters; _provided_ , _however_
, that such access or investigation shall not interfere materially with the
normal operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and
each Bank shall permit Acquiror and its Representatives to discuss the
business affairs, condition (financial and otherwise), assets and liabilities
of the Company and each Bank with the Companys and each Banks
Representatives, as is necessary or reasonably appropriate for the purposes of
familiarizing itself with the businesses and operations of the Company and
each Bank, to the extent allowable by applicable Legal Requirements. Upon
request, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries will furnish Acquiror or its
Representatives attorneys responses to auditors requests for information
regarding the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such
financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested by
Acquiror (provided, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege).
No investigation by Acquiror or any of its Representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement. This
**Section 5.1(a)** shall not require the disclosure of any information to
Acquiror the disclosure of which, in the Companys reasonable judgment: (i)
would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii) would result in
the breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on the date of this
Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened litigation or
investigations, if disclosure would reasonably be expected to affect the
confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters being
discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply,
the Company and Acquiror will make appropriate alternative disclosure
arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any
applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
promptly furnish to Acquiror: (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking
laws or federal or state securities laws; and (ii) a copy of each report filed
by it or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case
other than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or
examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable
Legal Requirement. The reports, schedules, registration statements and other
documents filed or furnished will fairly present the financial position of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and each Bank, as applicable, and, to the extent applicable, the
results of its operations at the dates and for the periods indicated in
compliance with applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(c) The Company shall provide, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to provide,
to Acquiror all information provided to the directors on all such boards or
members of such committees in connection with all meetings of the board of
directors and committees of the board of directors of the Company or otherwise
provided to the directors or members, and to provide any other financial
reports or other analysis prepared for senior management of the Company or its
Subsidiaries; in each case other than portions of such documents: (i) relating
to confidential supervisory or examination materials; (ii) the disclosure of
which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement; (iii) the disclosure of
which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Companys outside counsel,
result in the waiver of the attorney-client privilege; or (iv) related to an
Acquisition Proposal (disclosure of which shall be governed solely by
**Section 5.7**). All such financial information will fairly present the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, shareholders equity
and cash flows of the Company and each Bank at the dates and for the periods
indicated in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated, except that unaudited financial statements may be subject
to normal year-end audit adjustments required by GAAP.

 



 

(d) All information obtained by Acquiror in accordance with this **Section
5.1** shall be treated in confidence as provided in that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 11, 2018, between Acquiror and
the Company (as amended, the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ").

 



 

 **Section 5.2** _Operation of the Company and Company Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) Except as Previously Disclosed, as expressly permitted or required by this
Agreement, as required by applicable Legal Requirements, or with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, during the period from the date of this Agreement
to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to: (i) conduct its business (including the making of or agreeing
to make any loans or other extensions of credit) in the Ordinary Course of
Business; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve
intact its business organization and advantageous business relationships, keep
available the services of its present Representatives and maintain its
relationships and goodwill with all suppliers, customers, depositors,
borrowers, landlords, creditors, licensors, licensees, employees and other
Persons having business relationships with the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company; (iii) perform under each of the Material Contracts; (iv) maintain
and keep their properties in as satisfactory repair and condition as presently
maintained, except for obsolete properties and for deterioration due to
ordinary wear and tear; (v) comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements; and (vi) take no action that is intended to or
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the
ability of the Company or Acquiror to obtain any of the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result
in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or either Bank; or (b) would
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of the
Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein. Acquiror and the Company shall each promptly advise the other party of
any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall promptly notify Acquiror of
any notice or other communication from any party to any Company Material
Contract to the effect that such party has terminated or intends to terminate
or otherwise materially adversely modify its relationship with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company and
Company Board will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
shareholders the votes in favor of the adoption of this Agreement required by
the IBCA, including by recommending that its shareholders vote in favor of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, and the Company and Company
Board will not (a) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse
to Acquiror or the ability of either party to consummate the Merger (or
authorize or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Acquiror or the ability of either party to
consummate the Merger) the Company Boards recommendation to the Companys
shareholders that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including the
Merger; (b) adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company, or
resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal; or (c) fail to publicly, finally and
without qualification (i) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal; or (ii)

each case, within ten (10) Business Days after such Acquisition Proposal is
made public or any request by Acquiror to do so (which request may be made
once per Acquisition Proposal (and any material change thereto)) (any such
action, a " **Company Adverse Recommendation** "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company Board is permitted to make a Company Adverse Recommendation in
accordance with **Section 5.7**.

 



 

 **Section 5.5** _Information Provided to Acquiror_. The Company agrees that
the information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or to be provided by the Company to Acquiror for inclusion or that is
included in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement and any other
documents to be filed with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions will: (a) at the respective times such documents are
filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes
effective and, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, when mailed, not be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the
case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, not be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any
proxy for the meeting in connection with which the Joint Proxy Statement shall
be mailed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no
responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any information with respect to
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates contained in
the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement or in any document
submitted to, or other communication with, any Regulatory Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.6** _Operating Functions_. The Company and the Banks shall
cooperate with Acquiror and Acquiror Bank in connection with planning for the
efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the operation of each of
the Banks and Acquiror Bank, and in preparing for the consolidation of the
banks appropriate operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time
or such later date as the parties may mutually agree; including, to the extent
necessary, by providing notices and other documentation to all insurance
carriers, which will confirm to such carriers that the Surviving Entity is the
owner of all insurance accounts after the Effective Time and that the
Surviving Entity is the agent of record for all policies relating to such
insurance accounts after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 5.7** _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any Persons other than Acquiror with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, promptly request (to the extent it has not already done so prior to the
date of this Agreement) any Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement in connection with any actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or
destroy all confidential information of the Company or its Affiliates in the
possession of such Person or its Representatives pursuant to the provisions of
any prior agreement between the Company and such Person. The Company shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under: (i) any
standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Affiliates is a party; or (ii) any confidentiality provision in any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party other than, with
respect to this clause (ii), any waiver, amendment, modification or permission
under a confidentiality provision that does not, and would not be reasonably
likely to, facilitate, knowingly encourage or relate in any way to an
Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill
provisions of any such agreement, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, immediately take all steps within their power necessary to
terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person
other than Acquiror under any such provisions.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any discussions or negotiations
concerning, or provide any information, including any confidential or
nonpublic information, or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting a Person
for the sole purpose of seeking clarification of the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal); or (ii) approve, recommend or enter into, or
propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar
document, memorandum of understanding, agreement, commitment, or agreement in
principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, if at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Person
other

 



      
 

 



 

than Acquiror after the execution of this Agreement that did not result from
the Companys, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives breach of
this **Section 5.7**, and, after considering the advice of its outside legal
and financial advisors the Company Board concludes in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
likely to result in a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements, the Company may: (A) furnish information with respect to
it to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive in all material respects on
such Person as the Confidentiality Agreement (subject to the requirement that
any such information not previously provided to Acquiror shall be promptly
furnished to Acquiror concurrently with the time such information is provided
or made available to such Person); and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than one Business Day
after receipt) notify Acquiror in writing in the event that the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives receives an
Acquisition Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including an unredacted copy of such Acquisition Proposal or, where such
Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a description of the terms thereof).
The Company shall keep Acquiror reasonably informed, on a current basis, as to
the status of (including any developments, discussions or negotiations) such
Acquisition Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than one
Business Day after receipt) providing to Acquiror copies of any written
correspondence, proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements
relating to such Acquisition Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its
Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Acquiror in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this
**Section 5.7**.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in **Section 5.4**, if
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, but not after, in response to the
receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal subsequent to
the date of this Agreement, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that: (i) the
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this **Section 5.7**;
(ii) the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (iii) the
failure to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal, or enter into a
definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, the
Company Board may, subject to compliance with this **Section 5.7**, effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that prior to so effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminating this Agreement: (A) the Company has given Acquiror at least
five Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of,
and the identity of the Person making, any such Superior Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Acquiror a copy of the Superior Proposal, a copy
of any proposed acquisition agreements with respect thereto and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in
writing to Company, a written summary of

 



       
 

 



 

the terms thereof); (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Acquiror during such notice
period, to the extent Acquiror wishes to negotiate, to enable Acquiror to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; (C) upon the
end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Acquiror, and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside legal
and financial advisors, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Acquiror were
to be given effect and that the failure to approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal, or enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal, would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements; and (D) in the event of any change to any of
the material financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment
of consideration) or any other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Acquiror an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new
notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence during which
time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
**Section 5.7(d)** anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso; and _provided, further_ , that
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this **Section 5.7**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall enter into
any definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** _Third Party Consents_. The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts, and Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate with the Company at the
Companys request, to obtain all Third Party Consents and such other waivers
or consents as otherwise required to be obtained from any Person in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including such
consents set forth in **Section 3.4** of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
and such waivers and consents shall be in such form and content as is approved
by Acquiror and the Company.

 



 

 **Section 5.9** _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. If requested by
Acquiror, the Company shall, and shall cause each Bank to, consistent with
GAAP, immediately prior to Closing, make such accounting entries as Acquiror
may reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of the
Company and each Bank to the accounting policies and practices of Acquiror. No
such adjustment shall by itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant,
condition or other provision or constitute grounds for termination of this
Agreement or be an acknowledgment by the Company or either Bank of any adverse
circumstances for purposes of determining whether the conditions to Acquirors
obligations under this Agreement have been satisfied. No adjustment required
by Acquiror shall: (i) require any prior filing with any Regulatory Authority;
or (ii) violate any applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** _Environmental Investigations_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror and its Representatives shall have the right, upon execution of a
mutually agreeable site access agreement including customary and reasonable
insurance

 



      
 

 



 

coverage for the Company, to enter the Companys and its Subsidiaries real
property, whether leased or owned (at Acquirors sole cost and expense), but
not the obligation or responsibility, to inspect any such real property,
including conducting asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments
and investigation, and other non-invasive or non-destructive environmental
surveys and analyses (" **Environmental Inspections** ") on or prior to sixty
(60) days after the date of this Agreement. If any such Environmental
Inspection reveals a Recognized Environmental Condition or material Business
Environmental Risk as defined by the ASTM due diligence standard, further
investigation (a " **Secondary Investigation** ") including test borings,
soil, water, asbestos or other sampling, is deemed desirable by Acquiror,
Acquiror shall: (i) notify the Company of any real property for which it seeks
to conduct such a Secondary Investigation and the reasons for such Secondary
Investigation; (ii) submit a work plan to the Company for such Secondary
Investigation, for which Acquiror agrees to afford the Company the ability to
comment on and Acquiror agrees to reasonably consider all such comments (and
negotiate in good faith any such comments); and (iii) conclude such Secondary
Investigation, on or prior to thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of
the Companys comments. Acquiror shall give reasonable notice to the Company
of such Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations, and the
Company may place reasonable restrictions on the time and place at which such
Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations may be carried out.
Acquiror and the Company will cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to as promptly as possible conclude the Environmental Inspections and any
Secondary Investigation.

 



 

(b) Acquiror shall not have any liability to the Company or either Bank or
responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or other
findings related to any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or
other environmental survey, except to the extent that Acquiror or it
Representatives cause any environmental liability with respect thereto.
Acquiror promptly shall deliver to the Company copies of any environmental
report, engineering report, or property condition report prepared by Acquiror
or any third party pursuant to this **Section 5.10**. Any results or findings
of any Environmental Inspections will not be disclosed by Acquiror to any
third party not affiliated with Acquiror, unless Acquiror is required by
applicable Legal Requirements to disclose such information or the Company
provides written consent to disclose such information (which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). If this Agreement is
terminated, then except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, reports to any Regulatory Authority of the results of any
Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other environmental
survey shall be made by the Company in the exercise of its sole discretion and
not by Acquiror. Acquiror shall make no such report prior to Closing unless
required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements, and in such case will give
the Company reasonable prior notice to enable the Company to review and
comment on such proposed report and to make such report on behalf of the
Company, at Companys sole discretion.

 



 

(c) If any past or present events, conditions or circumstances require further
investigation, remedial or cleanup action under Environmental Laws at its
properties (other than Bank OREO) involving an expenditure reasonably expected
to exceed $1,500,000 based on estimates prepared by the consultant conducting
the Environmental Inspections or Secondary Investigations, then (i) to the
extent the aggregate expenditures with respect thereto are or are reasonably
expected to be equal to or less than $10,000,000, the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be reduced at the Closing by the difference between
$1,500,000 and the

 



      
 

 



 

estimated amount of such expenditures; or (ii) to the extent the aggregate
expenditures with respect thereto are or are reasonably expected to exceed
$10,000,000, Acquiror may, at it sole option, elect by written notice to the
Company to (A) cause the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to be
reduced at the Closing by the difference between $1,500,000 and the estimated
amount of such expenditures; or (B) terminate this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees to make available upon request to Acquiror and its
Representatives all documents and other materials relating to environmental
conditions of any Company real property, including the results of other
environmental inspections and surveys to the extent such documents are in the
possession or reasonable control of the Company. The Company also agrees that
all engineers and consultants who prepared or furnished such reports may
discuss such reports and information with Acquiror and, at Acquirors cost and
expense, shall be entitled to certify the same in favor of Acquiror and its
Representatives and make all other data available to Acquiror and its
Representatives.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** _Title Insurance_. In preparation for the Closing, as soon
as reasonably practicable and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, the Company will request, with respect
to each parcel of real property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (" **Owned Real Property** ") other than Bank OREO, a title
commitment on a form of Owners Policy of Title Insurance reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror (each a " **Title Commitment,** " collectively, the "
**Title Commitments** ") issued by a title company selected by Acquiror ("
**Title Company** "), committing to insure the Surviving Entitys title in
such parcel of Owned Real Property, other than Bank OREO, in the amount not
less than the greater of (i) the appraised value of the property (if
available) and (ii) the value at which the Company or the applicable Bank
currently carries the property on its books. The Company will request on each
Title Commitment that the so-called "standard printed exceptions" are deleted
from the Title Commitment so the Surviving Entity will have extended coverage.
The Company will cause the Title Company to deliver to the Surviving Entity,
promptly after the Closing Date, an owners title insurance policy issued by
the Title Company insuring the Surviving Entitys title to each parcel of
Owned Real Property other than Bank OREO consistent with the applicable
Closing Title Commitment (as defined below) (each a " **Title Policy,** "
collectively, the " **Title Policies** "), subject only to the Permitted
Exceptions. The Company will pay the premium for each Title Policy prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 5.12** _Surveys_. Acquiror may, in its discretion, within forty-
five (45) days after the date hereof, require the Company to provide, at the
Companys expense and as soon as practicable prior to the Closing, a current
American Land Title Association survey of any or all parcels of real property
owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than property carried as
OREO, disclosing no survey defects that would materially impair the use
thereof for the purposes for which it is held or materially impair the value
of such property.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** _Redemption of 2021 Sub-Debt_. Subject to receipt of any
approvals required from any Regulatory Authorities to either provide the
necessary funding or effect the redemption, the Company will redeem all
outstanding debentures included in the 2021 Sub-Debt immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In connection therewith, the Company shall take all actions as
may be reasonably required in order to obtain any required approvals.

 



 

 **Section 5.14** Interim Financial Statements.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall provide Acquiror within
ten (10) Business Days of the end of such month with (i) an unaudited
unconsolidated balance sheet of the Companys Subsidiaries as of the end of
each calendar month, and an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the end of each calendar quarter; (ii) an
unaudited unconsolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of each
calendar month; (iii) the unaudited AOCI of the Company as of the end of each
calendar month; and (iv) the unaudited general ledger of the Company as of the
end of each calendar month (collectively, the " **Unaudited Monthly Financial
Statements** "). The Unaudited Monthly Financial Statements shall (A) be
prepared from, and in accordance with, the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (B) be prepared in accordance with GAAP; and (C) with
respect to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial
position of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the respective
fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject to
recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount).

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause the Companys independent auditor to,
cooperate with Acquiror in connection with the preparation of financial
statements, if any, of the Company and pro forma financial statements that
Acquiror may file with the SEC.

 



 

 **Section 5.15** Pre-Closing Dispositions. The Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the sale or transfer of the assets set forth on
**Section 5.15** of the Company Disclosure Schedules (each sale or transfer, a
" **Pre-Closing Disposition** " and collectively, the "Pre-Closing
Dispositions"). The terms on which each Pre-Closing Disposition is effected
(including the documentation with respect thereto and the financial viability
of the transferee) shall be subject to Acquirors prior written approval,
which shall be not be unreasonably withheld, and, except as approved in
writing by Acquiror, shall (a) provide for the transferee to assume all
liabilities related to the transferred assets; (b) have no recourse to the
Company, Acquiror, the Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries after the
transfer; and (c) shall include such other terms as set forth on **Section
5.15** of the Company Disclosure Schedules with respect to such Pre-Closing
Disposition.

Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Acquiror shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries not to: (a) take any action that is intended to or would

Acquiror or the Company to obtain any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate

Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its

that its shareholders vote in favor of the proposal, and Acquiror and the
Acquiror Board will not withhold, withdraw, qualify or adversely modify (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or adversely
modify) such recommendation to Acquirors shareholders.

 



 

 **Section 6.3** _Information Provided to the Company_. Acquiror agrees that
the information concerning Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or to be provided by Acquiror to the Company for inclusion or that is
included in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement and any other
documents to be filed with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the
case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, not be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit

cooperate with the Company and each of the Banks in connection with planning

 **Section 6.5** _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, each current or former
director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, an " **Indemnified Party** "), and any Person who becomes an
Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim
or Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to

or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. The Surviving Entity
shall also advance expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in each such case
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, subject to
the receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such
advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled
to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under **Section
6.5(a)**, upon learning of any claim for indemnification pursuant thereto,
shall promptly notify Acquiror thereof; _provided, however_ , that failure to
so notify will not affect the obligations of the Surviving Entity under
**Section 6.5(a)** unless and to the extent that the Surviving Entity is
actually prejudiced as a consequence. In the event of any such legal action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) the Surviving Entity
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Entity
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving
Entity elects in writing not to assume such defense, Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Entity shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for Indemnified Parties promptly
as statements therefor are received; _provided, however_ , that in such
instance the Surviving Entity shall be obligated pursuant to this **Section
6.5(b)** to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
any jurisdiction; (ii) Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such claim for indemnification; and (iii) the Surviving Entity shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and
provided, further, that the Surviving Entity shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
under **Section 6.5(a)** is prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and Acquiror shall
fully pay the premium for the extension of the Companys directors and
officers liability

 



      
 

 



 

insurance policies set forth on **Schedule 6.5(c)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (complete and accurate copies of which have been heretofore delivered
or made available to Acquiror) (the " **Existing D andO Policy**") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Person currently covered by the Existing DandO Policy for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _that_ , Acquiror shall not be

provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, each of Acquiror and the Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary of Acquiror and the Company, respectively, and all of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with respect to all

 **Section 7.5** _Tax Free Reorganization_.

 



 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that
this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the income Tax regulations promulgated under the Code.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
of the Company and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts, to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken which action or failure to act would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Following the Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of
Acquiror knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail
to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or

 



      
 

 



 

failure to act would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Within forty-five (45) days
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall comply with the
reporting requirements of Section 1.6045B-1(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
Each of the Company and Acquiror shall report the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code on its U.S. federal income
Tax Return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and counsel to
Acquiror, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Sections 8.8**
and **9.8** , certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published
advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and
modifications thereto (the " **IRS Guidelines** "), to enable counsel to
Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated
by **Sections 8.8** and **9.8** , respectively, and the Company hereby agrees
to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or
(ii) why counsel to the Company would not be able to deliver the opinion
required by **Section 9.8**. The Company will deliver such certificates to
counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not know of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the
Company, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Sections 8.8** and
**9.8** , certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to
enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal
opinions contemplated by **Sections 8.8** and **9.8** , respectively, and
Acquiror hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date
of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Acquiror would not be able to deliver
the opinion required by **Section 8.8**. Acquiror will deliver such
certificates to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) To the extent reasonably requested by Acquiror, which request shall be
made to the Company at least forty-five (45) days before the Closing Date, and
to the extent permitted by the terms of such Company Benefit Plan, the Company
or either Bank, as appropriate, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
execute and deliver such instruments and take such other actions as Acquiror
may reasonably request in order to cause the amendment or termination of any
Company Benefit Plan on terms reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and, except as may be otherwise
provided herein, effective no later than the Effective Time, and provided that
the winding up of any such plan may be completed following the Closing Date,
provided further that the Company or such Bank has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to complete the winding up of any such plan prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (" **Covered Employees** ") shall
automatically become employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are

 



       
 

 



 

substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of
Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any
closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as the
Surviving Entity shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror
Benefit Plans, a Covered Employees continued participation in Company Benefit
Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it
being understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence
at different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan).

 



 

(c) For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods
(but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans
providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the " **New Plans** "), each
Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same
extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under
any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date; _provided_ , that such recognition of prior service (i) is
permitted by the terms of the applicable New Plan, or Acquiror can reasonably
amend the terms of such plan to permit such recognition; (ii) is permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements; and (iii) shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service.

 



 

(d) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately
prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Transition Date collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar
benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee,
as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into
account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred
during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) As of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall assume the severance plans and
related agreements set forth on **Section 7.6(e)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules (collectively, the " **Severance Plan** "), and honor all
obligations of the Company thereunder; provided, however, Acquiror shall not
assume the Severance Plan or any obligation that would be owing thereunder in
connection with any merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, sale of assets or other similar transaction involving Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries other than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated herein.

 



 

(f) Any Company employee who has or is party to any employment agreement,
severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or
arrangement that provides for a payment or other severance benefit triggered
by the Merger under such employment agreement, severance agreement, change in
control agreement or any other agreement or arrangement (a " **CIC Payment**
") (for purposes of clarity, the term CIC Payment shall not include an
acceleration of vesting due to the Merger under a salary continuation
agreement or other non-qualified deferred compensation plan) shall not receive
any severance benefits pursuant to the Companys non-executive change in
control severance plans or any policy or plan of Acquiror or the Surviving
Entity, but will receive the CIC Payment to the extent it is required to be
paid under such agreement; _provided, that_ , on or before the Closing Date
the Company will take all steps necessary to ensure that in the event that the
amounts of the CIC Payment, either individually or in conjunction with a
payment or benefit under any other plan, agreement or arrangement that is
aggregated for purposes of Code Section 280G (in the aggregate " **Total
Payments** "), would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code that is subject to the Tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts of the CIC Payment shall be reduced
such that the value of the Total Payments that each counterparty is entitled
to receive shall be $1.00 less than the maximum amount which the counterparty
may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax or resulting in a
disallowance of a deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G
of the Code.

 



 

(g) To the extent requested in writing by Acquiror, immediately prior to
Closing, the Company shall make such payments designated in writing by
Acquiror pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** _Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover
Legal Requirement is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement; and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably
necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Legal Requirement
on the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each

reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **Section 7.9** _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Acquiror
shall give the other party prompt notice of any litigation against the
Company, Acquiror, as applicable, or any of their respective directors or
officers relating to the Contemplated Transactions. The Company shall give
Acquiror the opportunity to participate, at Acquirors cost, in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Acquiror, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph,
"participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
litigation by the litigating party, consistent with the common interest of the
Company and Acquiror in these matters and the applicable privileges and
protections provided therein, and the non-litigating party may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to the litigation and any documents to be prepared
or filed in connection therewith, which will be reasonably considered in good
faith by the litigating party.

 



 

 **Section 7.10** _Dividends_. Acquiror and the Company acknowledge and agree
that, subject to the Companys compliance with all Legal Requirements before
and after each applicable dividend payment, including obtaining any approvals

Contemplated Transactions and such denial has become final and nonappealable;
(ii) any application, filing or notice for a Requisite Regulatory Approval has

respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this **Section 10.1(d)** shall not be available to a party
whose failure (or the failure of any of its Affiliates) to fulfill any of its
obligations (excluding warranties and representations) under this Agreement
has been the cause of or resulted in the occurrence of any event described in

Agreement;

 



 

(e) by Acquiror or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred

(f) by Acquiror or the Company if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Regulatory Authority shall have issued a judgment, Order, injunction, rule or

injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable;

 



 

(g) by Acquiror if the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation or if
the Company materially breaches any of its obligations under **Section 5.4**
or **Section 5.7**; or

 



 

(h) by the Company pursuant to **Section 5.7(d)**;

 



 

(i) by Acquiror pursuant to **Section 5.10(c)**;

 



 

(j) by the Company, if both of the following conditions are satisfied on the
Determination Date, such termination to be effective on the tenth (10th) day
following the Determination Date: (i) the Final Acquiror Market Value is less
than $26.60; and (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Final Acquiror
Market Value by the Initial Acquiror Market Value shall be less than the Index
Ratio multiplied by 0.80; _subject, however_ , to the following three
sentences. If the Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to
this **Section 10.1(j)**, it shall give written notice thereof to Acquiror
within two (2) Business Days. During the five (5) Business Day period
commencing with its receipt of such notice, Acquiror shall have the option to
increase the Per Share Stock Consideration to equal the lesser of (x) a
quotient, the numerator of which is equal to the product of (A) the Initial
Acquiror Market Value; (B) the Per Share Stock Consideration; and (C) the
Index Ratio multiplied by 0.80 and the denominator of which is equal to the
Final Acquiror Market Value; or (y) the quotient determined by dividing the
Initial Acquiror Market Value by the Final Acquiror Market Value, and
multiplying the quotient by the

 



      
 

 



 

product of the Per Share Stock Consideration and 0.80. If within such five (5)
Business Day period, Acquiror delivers written notice to the Company that it
intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies the Company of the
revised Per Share Stock Consideration, then no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this **Section 10.1(j)**, and this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Per Share Stock
Consideration shall have been so modified). If Acquiror or any company
belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the
prices for the common stock of such company shall be appropriately adjusted

Confidentiality Agreement, this **Section 10.2**, **Section 10.3** and

the amount of $7,600,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ") plus all documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Acquiror in connection with the

shall designate; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this paragraph,
Acquisition Proposal has the meaning ascribed thereto in **Section 12.1(l)**,
except that references in that Section to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%."

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee and Acquiror Expenses are or become
payable pursuant to **Section 10.3(b)** or **Section 10.3(c)**, Acquirors

set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Neither the
failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or

or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Except as provided in **Article 10**, the
