TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

  

  

This Transaction Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated the date set forth on the
signature page hereto (the "Signature Page"), is among the Person designated
on the Signature Page as "Buyer," the Person designated on the Signature Page
as "Merger Sub," a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of

"Company"). The foregoing Persons are sometimes referred to herein
collectively as the "Parties" and individually as a "Party."

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable the Merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

  

  

B. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Company, Buyer
and certain other Persons (such other Persons, collectively, the "Principal

pursuant to which the Principal Shareholders have agreed, on the terms and
subject to the conditions therein, to vote their Common Shares to adopt this
Agreement.

  

  

C. The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
covenants in respect of, and also to provide certain conditions to the

D. Capitalized terms not defined elsewhere herein have the meanings given to
such terms in Article VIII.

  

  

I. THE TRANSACTIONS

  

  

1.1 The Merger.

  

  

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will merge (the "Merger") with and into the Company, with the Company being
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

(b) On the consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease, and the Surviving Corporation will continue its
corporate existence under the DGCL as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer.

  

  

1.2 Closing. The consummation of the Merger and the closing of the
Transactions (the "Closing") will take place electronically at the offices of
Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at (a) 10:00 a.m. New
York City time on the later of (i) the date which is two Business Days after
the date on which all conditions set forth in

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

Article VI have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of such
conditions) and (ii) October 15, 2014 or (b) such other time and place as
Buyer (without joinder by Merger Sub) and the Company may mutually agree in
writing (the "Closing Date").

  

  

1.3 Filing of Certificates of Merger; Effective Time. As soon as practicable
on the Closing Date, the Company will cause the certificate of merger for the
Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Effective Time" means the time at
which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed in the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and becomes effective in
accordance with the DGCL.

  

  

1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the
DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger and, without limiting the
foregoing, all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger
Sub and the Company will vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company will become debts,
liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company will be amended and restated in its entirety to be in a form
approved by Buyer prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended,
subject to Section 5.4, as provided therein or by applicable Law. The Bylaws
of the Company will be amended and restated in their entirety to be in a form
approved by Buyer prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended,
subject to Section 5.4, as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

1.6 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office
until his or her respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with
the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
DGCL.

  

  

1.7 Merger Consideration. The aggregate merger consideration to be paid by
Buyer to Common Shareholders and Option Holders at the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 1.8 with respect to the Merger is an amount (the "Merger
Consideration") equal to (a) the Purchase Price, minus (b) the amount of the
Transaction Expenses. Schedule 1.7 sets forth the Company's good faith
estimate of the calculation of Merger Consideration as of the date of this
Agreement.

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-2-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

1.8 Conversion of Capital Stock.

  

  

(a) The Company. Subject to this Article I and in accordance with Article II,
with respect to the Merger:

  

  

(i) Common Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of shares of the Company's common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (collectively, the "Common Shares"), each Common
Share that is then issued and outstanding (other than the Dissenting Shares,
if any), will be converted and automatically exchanged into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to its Pro Rata Portion of the Merger
Consideration payable to Common Shareholders (such aggregate amount, the
"Share Consideration"), as set forth on the Closing Payments Schedule pursuant
to Section 2.1 (which amounts will be calculated on a basis consistent with
Schedule 1.7), without interest; and

  

  

(ii) Stock Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to acquire Common Shares (each, a "Stock Option") will become fully
vested and exercisable and at the Effective Time will be canceled, and the
applicable Option Holder will become entitled to receive, in lieu of receiving
any capital stock of the Company, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation and
subject to any applicable withholding and payroll deductions, an amount in
cash equal to its Pro Rata Portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to Option Holders as set forth on the Closing Payments Schedule
pursuant to Section 2.1, which amounts will be calculated on a basis
consistent with Schedule 1.7 (such aggregate amount reflecting deductions for
the exercise prices of such Stock Options, the "Option Payment"). For the
avoidance of doubt, all out-of-money options will be cancelled and will not
have any right to receive any consideration in respect thereof.

  

  

(b) Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub will be converted
into one share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if,
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding Common Shares occurs
as a result of the exercise of a Stock Option, the Company will reflect such
change in the Closing Payments Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

  

  

1.9 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article I, Dissenting Shares, if any, will not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof will be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL will receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the DGCL, except that if any such holder of
Dissenting Shares (a) fails to establish such holder's entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL or (b) irrevocably
withdraws such holder's demand for appraisal of such shares or loses such
holder's right to appraisal and payment for such holder's shares under Section
262 of the DGCL, such holder will

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such share will not
constitute a Dissenting Share and will be treated as if it had been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
this Article I and Article II, without any interest thereon.

  

  

II. PAYMENT OF CONSIDERATION

  

  

2.1 Closing Certificate. Not less than five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Buyer a written
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth:

  

  

(a) a schedule (the "Transaction Expense Payment Schedule") setting forth the
amount necessary to fully discharge the Company's Transaction Expenses that
are unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with wire
transfer instructions for each Person listed on the Transaction Expense
Payment Schedule and confirmation from each of the Company Professional
Advisors that, upon receipt of the wire transfers specified therein, such
Company Professional Advisors' rights to fees and reimbursement of expenses in
connection with the Transactions will be fully discharged; and

  

  

(b) a schedule (the "Closing Payments Schedule") setting forth (i) the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration, (ii) the aggregate amount to be
paid at the Effective Time to the Paying Agent in respect of the Share
Consideration, as well as the amount payable in respect of each Common Share,
which amount will be calculated on a basis consistent with Schedule 1.7, and
(iii) the aggregate amount of the Option Payment, as well as the portion
thereof to be paid to each former holder of Stock Options pursuant to Section
2.4.

  

  

Prior to the Closing, the Company will provide Buyer and its representatives
reasonable access to the records of the Company and its Subsidiaries used in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement and will cause the
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in connection with Buyer's review thereof. If Buyer disagrees with any
calculation set forth in the Closing Statement, it will notify the Company
promptly. Buyer and the Company will each use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any questions or comments to the Closing Statement promptly and in any
event prior to the scheduled Closing Date, so as not to result in a delay of
the Closing. If the Company and Buyer cannot agree on the Closing Statement
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, then the disputed amounts relating
thereto (the "Dispute Amounts") will be referred for final determination to
the Company's auditor, which will consider only those Dispute Amounts which
Buyer and the Company have been unable to resolve. The Parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause such auditor to deliver to Buyer and the
Company, as promptly as practicable (and in any event, within ten Business
Days), its determination of such Dispute Amounts. Such decision, absent
manifest error, will be final and binding on the Parties. In the event that
any Dispute Amounts are submitted to the auditor pursuant to this Section 2.1,
the Termination Date will be tolled until the date on which the auditor makes
its determination. In the event

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

that any Dispute Amounts are referred to the Company's auditor for resolution
in accordance with this paragraph, the fees of the Company's auditor related
to the resolution of any Dispute Amounts pursuant to this paragraph will be
borne by Buyer and the Company in inverse proportion as they may prevail on
matters resolved by the Company's auditor, which proportionate allocations
will also be determined by the Company's auditor at the time the determination
of the Company's auditor is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.
Any portion of the auditor's cost that is determined to be the responsibility
of the Company and any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company relating to
resolution of the Dispute Amounts (including fees and expenses of the
Company's attorneys) will be a Transaction Expense and will be included on the
Transaction Expense Payment Schedule for payment at Closing pursuant to
Section 2.2(b).

  

  

2.2 Closing Payments. At the Closing, Buyer will deliver by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as follows:

  

  

(a) an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Share Consideration to the
Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the Common Shareholders, payable in
accordance with Section 2.3 (such cash, and any proceeds thereon, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Fund");

  

  

(b) the amount set forth opposite each Person's name listed on the Transaction
Expenses Payment Schedule, which amount will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the instructions set forth in
the Transaction Expenses Payment Schedule; and

  

  

(c) the aggregate Option Payment to the Company, which amount will
subsequently be paid to former holders of Stock Options in accordance with
Section 2.4.

  

  

2.3 Exchange of Shares.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Within the earlier of (x) fifteen days of the date of this
Agreement or (y) five Business Days after the Proxy Statement is mailed, the
Company will (i) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the "Paying Agent Agreement"), with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Buyer and (ii) provide the Paying Agent
with a form letter of transmittal (the "LT") for the presentation of
certificates representing Common Shares converted into the Merger
Consideration, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, for the
Paying Agent to distribute to Common Shareholders.

  

  

(b) In accordance with the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, prior to or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than three Business Days following the Effective Time with respect to all
Common Shareholders), the Paying Agent will mail an LT to each holder of
record whose Common Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration for
use in effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates that immediately prior to

(c) Payment Procedures. On the Closing Date (or at such later date when a
Common Shareholder surrenders its Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, and delivers his, her or its LT), upon surrender by such Common
Shareholder to the Paying Agent of its Stock Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, and a duly executed LT, the Paying Agent will pay
within three Business Days to each such Common Shareholder, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account of such Common Shareholder
specified in the LT, such Common Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Share
Consideration (as determined in accordance with Section 1.8 and Section
2.1(c)). Until so surrendered, each Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, will be deemed, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the
right to receive upon such surrender, the Share Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article II.
No interest will be paid or accrued in respect of such cash payments. The
Paying Agent will provide Buyer a copy of each duly executed LT, including
such Common Shareholder's Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, within three Business Days of receipt from such Common
Shareholder. If the Share Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be
delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it will be a condition to the payment of such portion
of the Share Consideration that the Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, so surrendered are properly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such transfer pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or
other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
required to be paid. In the event any Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate, the portion of the Share Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof as determined in accordance with this Article II; provided, that the
Person to whom such portion of the Share Consideration is paid will, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify the Paying Agent, Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company (including the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time) and any of their respective Affiliates in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to them against any claim that may be made against the Paying
Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company (including the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time) and any of their respective Affiliates with respect
to the Stock Certificate, claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

(d) Closing of Share Register. At the Effective Time, the shareholders'
register of the Company will be closed, and there will be no further
registration of transfers on the shareholders' register of the Surviving
Corporation of the Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the proper
amount pursuant to this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
the Dissenting Shares.

(e) Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
each of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
and timely remitted under the Code or any applicable provision of U.S. state,
U.S. local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

  

  

(f) Termination of Merger Fund. Any portion of the Merger Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former
Common Shareholders for one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former Common Shareholders who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws), and the Surviving Corporation will remain liable (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), for payment of such
holder's portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration upon due surrender of
their Common Shares and the execution of customary documentation, including an
LT.

  

  

(g) No Liability; Escheat. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
none of the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former Common Shareholder for
any amount properly delivered from the Merger Fund to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any certificate
or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered immediately prior to such date on
which the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the holder
of such certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Article II would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such certificate or Book-Entry Share
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(h) Payments to Paying Agent; Investment. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, all payments by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of this Article
II for the satisfaction of any obligation (including payment of the Share
Consideration) will constitute full satisfaction to the applicable Common
Shareholder or otherwise, except that if there are any losses due to an
investment of the Merger Fund, such that the Merger Fund is no longer
sufficient to pay the aggregate Share Consideration, Buyer will promptly
deposit in the Merger Fund cash in an amount required to fully satisfy the
aggregate Share Consideration. The Paying Agent will invest all cash included
in the Merger Fund as set forth in the Paying Agent Agreement.

Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
operations prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

5.2 Access. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Buyer and its accountants, counsel and other Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, in such manner as to not unreasonably
interfere with normal operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to all of
their respective properties, books, Contracts, personnel records and other
information concerning its Subsidiaries, properties and personnel as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
(but not including access to perform physical or environmental examinations or
to test or take samples, borings or other intrusive investigations of the
soil, surface or ground water, air, buildings or infrastructure).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
is under any obligation to disclose to Buyer any information the disclosure of
which (a) is restricted by applicable Law or any contractual obligations to
any third party or (b) is subject to attorney-client privilege. Buyer and its
representatives will not have access to employment records of individual
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing except on
such terms as may be agreed by the Company and Buyer in order to protect
confidential information and ensure compliance with all applicable Laws and
the Company's policies.

  

  

5.3 Antitrust Approvals.

  

  

(a) Each of Buyer and the Company will (i) make or cause to be made all
filings required of it or its Affiliates under the Antitrust Laws with respect
to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, any required
filings pursuant to the HSR Act within five Business Days from the date of
this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request
under the Antitrust Laws for additional

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-29-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

information, documents or other materials received by it or its Affiliates
from any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or the
Transactions, and (iii) cooperate with the other Party in connection with any
such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law with respect to
any such filing or the Transactions. Each of Buyer and the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other Party all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the Transactions and promptly inform the
other Party of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or
the Transactions. No Party will independently participate in any scheduled
meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Parties
hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting. Without limiting the foregoing or any of the other provisions of this
Section 5.3, the parties agree to cooperate to devise the strategy for
filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any
Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws.

  

  

(b) Each of Buyer and the Company will use its respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust
Law and use its respective reasonable best efforts to take such action as may
be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after the
execution of this Agreement. In connection therewith, if any Action is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions (or
any portion thereof) as in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Buyer and
the Company will cooperate and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Governmental Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions unless Buyer and the Company mutually decide
that litigation is not in their respective best interests. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, each of Buyer and the Company will use
their reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the Parties to close
the Transactions as expeditiously as possible and in any event prior to the
Termination Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries), (iii) terminating any venture or other
arrangement of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries), and (iv) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Buyer's or its Affiliates'
(including, following the Closing, the Company's and its Subsidiaries')
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
the businesses, product lines, intellectual property or assets of Buyer and
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the
Transactions, except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-30-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

Company and its Subsidiaries will only be obligated to take any of the actions
described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 5.3(b) if such action is
conditional or contingent on the Closing occurring in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on
either the Company or the Buyer or the combined business of the Buyer and the
Company.

  

  

(c) Buyer will pay all filing fees payable to Governmental Authorities under
any Antitrust Law.

  

  

5.4 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer and Merger Sub agree to cause the
Surviving Corporation to ensure, and the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Closing agrees to ensure, that all rights to indemnification,
advancement and exculpation now existing in favor of any individual who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, was a current or former director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who, at
the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (collectively, with such individual's heirs, executors or
administrators, the "Indemnified Persons") as provided in the respective
governing documents and indemnification agreements to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, will survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the
Effective Time (or, in the case of indemnification agreements, the term
thereof), and the indemnification agreements and the provisions with respect
to indemnification, advancement, exculpation and limitations on liability set
forth in such charters and by-laws will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified.

  

  

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Buyer will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's or
any of its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
on terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage, except that if any claim is asserted or made within such
six-year period, such insurance will be continued solely in respect of such
claim until the final disposition thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation will be permitted to cause coverage to be
extended by obtaining a six-year "tail policy" on such terms, but in such
event Buyer and the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an
amount in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
its current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (the
"Maximum Premium"). If Buyer or the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain
the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal
to the Maximum Premium, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation will, jointly and
severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as reasonably possible
for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-31-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.4 will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified Person hereunder and its successors and representatives.

  

  

(d) The obligations under this Section 5.4 will not be terminated or modified
by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnified Person to whom this Section 5.4 applies without the consent of the
affected indemnified Person. In the event that either Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties or assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper
provision will be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or
transferees assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

  

  

5.5 Employment Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the "Benefit
Period"), Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the employees
of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries, so long as employed by the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Benefit Period, (i)
a salary or wage level and bonus opportunities, commissions, if applicable,
and benefits which are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the
salary, wages, bonus opportunities, commissions, if applicable, and benefits
provided immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Company or its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. This Section 5.5 will not limit the obligation
of the Surviving Corporation to maintain any Employee Plan that, pursuant to
an existing Contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one year. No
provision of this Agreement will be construed as a guarantee of continued
employment of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and this
Agreement will not be construed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any
employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Each employee and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries will
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date
for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plan of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries providing benefits similar to those provided under
an Employee Plan to the same extent as such employee or former employee was
entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under such
Employee Plan. With respect to the calendar year in which Buyer ceases to
maintain any particular Employee Plan, Buyer will cause the Surviving
Corporation to grant, or cause to be granted to, each employee credit for
amounts paid under such Employee Plan for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-32-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing this Agreement
will be in substantially the form previously agreed to by Buyer and the
Company. Thereafter, no Party will publish any press release or otherwise make
any similar public announcement with respect to the Transactions, without the
prior written consent of Buyer (without joinder by Merger Sub) and the
Company, except that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in
good faith is required by Law or any listing or trading agreement or rules
concerning its publicly traded securities. In addition, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will make any announcement to its employees,
customers and other business relations other than an announcement that is not
inconsistent with and no more detailed than any mutually agreed prior public
announcement unless the Company or such Subsidiary receives the prior written
consent of Buyer.

  

  

5.7 No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries, controlled Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Competing Proposal, terminate all physical and electronic data
room access previously granted to any such parties and their Representatives
and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith. Except as expressly permitted by
this Section 5.7, the Company will not, and will cause each of its
Representatives, its Subsidiaries and its controlled Affiliates not to, from
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1,
directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations with (other than to
state they are not permitted to engage in discussions), or furnish any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or
afford access to the books or records of the Company or its Subsidiaries to,
any Person concerning a possible Competing Proposal or that, to the Knowledge
of the Company, is seeking to make, or has made, a Competing Proposal, (iii)
approve, recommend or enter into any agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar contract
(whether or not binding) relating to any Competing Proposal (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement"), other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted
by Section 5.7(b), or (iv) authorize any of, or commit or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.7(a) above, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Required Shareholder Approval, the
Company or the Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may
(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with any third party that has made
(and not withdrawn) a bona fide unsolicited Competing Proposal in writing that
the Board believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and the Company's outside financial advisor, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) after making the
determination in clause (i), furnish nonpublic information to any such third
party (provided, however, that prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-33-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
substantially consistent with the Confidentiality Agreement and all such
information has previously been provided to Buyer or is provided to Buyer
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
third party); provided, that (A) such Competing Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a material breach of
this Section 5.7 by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives and (B) the Board determines, after
consultation with legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.7(c), neither the Board
nor any committee thereof will (i) withdraw, modify, or publicly propose to
withdraw or modify, or make a public statement inconsistent with, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Superior Proposal made or received after the date of this
Agreement or authorize or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of
the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 5.7(c), an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (iii) cause or permit the Company to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Required Shareholder Approval, the Board will be permitted (A) with respect to
any Competing Proposal that was made after the date of this Agreement and that
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.7, to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with Section 5.7(d) and Section 7.1(e), if in either case the Board
(1) has received a Competing Proposal that the Board determines in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Buyer and Merger Sub
pursuant to, Section 5.7(d), and (2) determines, after consultation with its
outside legal advisors, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, or (B) in response to an Intervening Event, to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition, if
the Board determines, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

(d) The Company will not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under Section 5.7(c) with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided prompt
written notice (in any event, within one Business Day (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") to Buyer that the Company intends to take such action, attaching
the definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal and describing the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
such action (it being understood that such material terms need not include the
identity of the third party), (ii) during the five-Business Day period
following Buyer's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company has,
and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Buyer in good faith (to
the extent Buyer desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal,

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-34-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

and (iii) following the end of the five-Business Day period, the Board has
determined in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and the
Company's financial advisor, taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Buyer in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any material amendment to
the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal
will require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company will be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.7(d), except
that references to the five-Business Day period above will be deemed to be
references to a three-Business Day period.

  

  

(e) The Company will not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted under Section 5.7(c) with respect to an Intervening Event
unless (i) the Company has provided written notice (a "Notice of Intervening
Event") to Buyer that the Company intends to take such action and describing
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of such Intervening Event,
and has received advice from its outside legal counsel that the failure to
effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) during the five-
Business Day period following Buyer's receipt of the Notice of Intervening
Event, the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with
Buyer in good faith (to the extent Buyer desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement if Buyer, in its
discretion, proposes to make such adjustments, and (iii) following the end of
the five-Business Day period, the Board has determined and has received advice
from its outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Buyer in response to the Notice of
Intervening Event or otherwise, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

  

  

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one Business Day of
receipt), advise Buyer of receipt by the Company of any Competing Proposal or

material amendments to any such Competing Proposal or request and keep Buyer
promptly informed as to the details of any information requested of or
provided by the Company and as to the details of all discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such request, Competing Proposal or inquiry,
including by providing Buyer a copy of all material documentation or
correspondence relating thereto as soon as practicable (and in any event
within one Business Day of receipt).

Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Common Shareholders a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14D-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any other communication to
the Common Shareholders, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) hereof,
that the Board determines, after consultation with legal counsel, that failure
to disclose such position or communicate with Common Shareholders would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

  

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Competing Proposal" means, other than
the Transactions, any proposal, offer or indication of interest making a
direct or indirect proposal or offer by, any Person (other than a proposal or

reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint venture or
similar transaction involving assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
equal to 15% or more of the fair market value of the Company's consolidated
assets or to which 15% or more of the Company's net revenues or net income on
a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) the acquisition (whether by direct
or indirect merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or
otherwise) by any Person pursuant to which such Person would own 15% or more
of the consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) the acquisition in any manner, directly or
indirectly, by any Person of 15% or more of the issued and outstanding Common

meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the voting equity interests of the Company, and (ii) "Superior Proposal" means
a Competing Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Competing
Proposal increased to 50%) made by a third party on terms that the Board
determines, after consultation with the Company's financial and legal
advisors, are more favorable to the Company and the Common Shareholders than
the Transactions after consideration by the Board of such factors as the Board
reasonably deems appropriate, including (a) financial considerations, (b) the
identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal, (c) the anticipated
timing, conditions (including any financing condition or the reliability of
any debt or equity funding commitments) and prospects for completion of such
Superior Proposal, (d) the other terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the implications thereof on the Company, including relevant
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Superior Proposal deemed relevant
by the Board and (e) any revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger proposed by the Buyer in writing (including pursuant to Section

Statement") and (ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Common
Shareholders as of the record date established for the Shareholders' Meeting.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating

their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the

Company or Buyer, respectively, which, should be set forth in an amendment or

cases within one Business Day) inform the others. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub
and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in
the Proxy Statement which becomes false or misleading. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the
Company will provide Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response (which comments will be provided
promptly by Buyer and will be reasonably considered by the Company).

  

  

5.9 Shareholders' Meeting.

  

  

(a) The Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law
and the Company's organizational documents to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Common Shareholders (which the Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to hold on or prior to September 30, 2014, but
in any event, no later than October 15, 2014) (the "Shareholders' Meeting")
for the purpose of obtaining the Required Shareholder Approval. Subject to the
ability of the Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance
with Section 5.7(c), the Board will recommend that the Common Shareholders
adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions (the "Company
Recommendation"), and will include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company, after consultation with Buyer, may adjourn or postpone the
Shareholders' Meeting (a) with Buyer's consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), as necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Common Shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Shareholders' Meeting, (b) if as of the time for which the Shareholders'
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Shareholders' Meeting
or (c) if required by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section
7.1(e), the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9,
including its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Shareholders' Meeting after the date hereof will not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Superior Proposal.

Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Buyer hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance
and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the obligations, covenants,
terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof.

Merger Sub and their respective representatives will contact and communicate

(b) Buyer and the Company will cooperate in good faith to permit Buyer to
contact and communicate with employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
is reasonably necessary to facilitate the integration and transition of the

consummation of the Transactions; provided, that such communications and
contact will not unreasonably interfere with the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

  

  

5.12 Reserved.

  

  

5.13 Financing.

  

  

(a) Buyer will take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing, including if necessary by enforcing its rights under the
Commitment Letter (including through litigation in the event that all
conditions to the commitment of the Financing Sources under the Commitment
Letter have been satisfied).

  

  

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, and such portion
is reasonably required to fund the Merger Consideration as of the Closing
Date, Buyer and Merger Sub will arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative debt financing ("Alternative Financing") from alternative sources.
Buyer will keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and,
if applicable, any Alternative Financing.

  

  

5.14 Cooperation with Financing.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company, at Buyer's sole expense, will provide
to Buyer and Merger Sub, and cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to provide to Buyer and Merger Sub, such reasonable
cooperation as is reasonably requested by Buyer and Merger Sub and customary
and necessary in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the
Financing, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause
appropriate senior officers of the Company to be available to, upon sufficient
prior notice and during normal business hours, participate in a reasonable
number of meetings and conference calls with prospective lenders and their
advisors at times and locations to be mutually agreed, (ii) reasonably
cooperate with Buyer's legal counsel in connection with any customary legal
opinions that such counsel is required to deliver in connection with the
Financing, (iii) review and provide comments to the confidential information
memorandum (the "CIM") prepared by Buyer and the Financing Sources for use in

-38-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

Company or its Subsidiaries, promptly advise Buyer if the CIM contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or if the Company determines in good faith
that the CIM omits to state any material fact, in each case with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, necessary in order to make such statements
contained in the CIM, in the context in which they were made, not misleading,
and promptly advising Buyer as to any updates and corrections to the CIM in
order to correct any such material misstatement or material omission, and (iv)
executing and delivering (but solely to the extent required in connection with
the Financing as of the Closing and subject to escrow pending consummation of
the Closing), effective not prior to the Closing, customary definitive
financing documentation in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including customary pledge and security documents and certificates, officer's
certificates, and documents and instruments relating to guarantees, collateral
and other matters ancillary to the Financing, and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral by the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the providing by the Company and its Subsidiaries of guarantees (including
(A) reasonably cooperating in connection with the payoff or release of
existing material Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the release of all Liens on the equity interests and assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing the same and (B) furnishing Buyer
and the Financing Sources promptly with all documentation and other
information required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT Act of 2011 and applicable regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 that is required
in connection with the Financing and requested in writing of the Company at
least five days prior to Closing).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.14(a), nothing herein will require (i) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any liability in connection with
the Financing prior to the Closing, (ii) cooperation from the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any
action contemplated by any other provision hereof, to the extent that it
determines in good faith that such cooperation or action would unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
or (iii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide, and Buyer will be
solely responsible for, (A) the preparation of pro forma financial
information, including pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization or
other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma
financial information, (B) any description of all or any component of the
Financing, (C) projections, risk factors or other forward-looking statements

3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, or (E) Compensation Disclosure and
Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K.

  

  

(c) Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its
Affiliates, and their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives, from and against any liability, obligation or loss
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, any information provided in connection therewith (other than
arising from information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries but
including violation of the Confidentiality Agreement) and any misuse of

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-39-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

the corporate logos, trademarks or service marks of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except in the event such liabilities, obligations or losses
arose out of or result from the willful misconduct of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives. Buyer will promptly
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation described in this Section 5.14 and, to the extent Buyer does not
reimburse the Company or its applicable Subsidiary for any such cost or
expense on or prior to the date of the Closing, such unreimbursed costs and
expenses will be excluded in the calculation of Transaction Expenses in
accordance with the definition thereof. Subject to Buyer's indemnification
obligations under this Section 5.14(c), the Company hereby agrees to furnish
to the Buyer and the Financing Sources for no fee, and hereby consents to
their use of, electronic versions of its and its Subsidiaries' trademarks,
service marks and corporate logos reasonably requested by Buyer in connection
with the initial syndication or marketing of the Financing, but only to the
extent that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and solely
for the purpose of facilitating the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of Section 6.2(b), Section 7.1(b) and
Section 7.1(d), the Company will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under this Section 5.14 unless the Company has deliberately
materially breached (determined in accordance with Section 7.2) its
obligations under this Section 5.14 and such breach has been the primary cause
of the Financing not being obtained.

  

  

(d) The Company hereby expressly authorizes the use of the financial
statements and other information provided pursuant to Section 5.14 for
purposes of the Financing.

  

  

5.15 Affiliated Transactions. Except for Contracts set forth in Schedule 5.15,
the Company will cause all Contracts listed or required to be listed on
Schedule 3.20 to be terminated in writing in full as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time without further liability to the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer (the "Termination Agreements"), and all payments required to be paid in
connection with such termination under such agreements (collectively,
"Termination Payments") will be included in Transaction Expenses.

  

  

5.16 Notification of Certain Matters. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly notify each other of (i) any material Action in connection with
the Transactions commenced or, to the Knowledge of Buyer and/or Merger Sub or
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (ii) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any fact or event which would be reasonably likely to cause any
condition set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied, (iii) any material
breach of this Agreement by such party, or (iv) any other material development
adversely affecting its ability to consummate the Transactions; provided that
no such notification, nor the obligation to make such notification, will be
deemed to modify the representations, warranties or covenants of any party
hereto or the conditions to the obligations of any party to this Agreement;

behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and

or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

  

5.18 Real Estate Deliverables. The Company will cooperate with Buyer, at

the Owned Real Property, issued by a title insurer reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer in such amount as Buyer may reasonably determine to be the fair market

insuring title to such real property to Buyer as of the Closing Date; and

  

  

(b) an ALTA Survey with respect to each parcel of the Owned Real Property,

5.19 Casualty. Until the Closing Date, the Company will, or cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, maintain the same or substantially the same (the
definition of "substantially" herein meaning no material change in coverage)
casualty insurance coverage for the Real Property as is currently carried by
the Company and any applicable Subsidiary. If prior to the Closing Date any
portion of any of the improvements located on any Real Property is damaged or
destroyed by fire or other casualty, then the Company will (i) promptly
deliver written notice to Buyer of the occurrence of such casualty and (ii)
discuss in good faith with Buyer potential actions to mitigate such damage or
destruction and thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to commence
mitigating any such damage or destruction in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Buyer (including making timely claims under insurance policies).

  

  

5.20 Condemnation. If, prior to the Closing Date, there is commenced or
instituted against any Real Property any eminent domain or similar
condemnation action or proceedings, the Company will (i) promptly give written
notice of same to Buyer and (ii) discuss in good faith with Buyer potential
actions to contest such condemnation.

  

  

5.21 OTC Market. Prior to or simultaneously with Closing, Company will take
all actions necessary to suspend the listing of its Common Shares on the Over-
the-Counter Market including filing the appropriate notice with the Financial

Transactions, (b) take such other action as may reasonably be necessary or as
another Party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions of Article VI

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 7.1, this Agreement will forthwith become void and
have no effect, and no Party, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any of the officers or directors of any of the foregoing, will
have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in
connection with the Transactions, except that (a) the Confidentiality
Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement, (b) the provisions
of Section 5.6, the indemnification and reimbursement obligations in Section
5.14, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article IX will survive any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms and
(c) notwithstanding any termination or any contrary provision contained in
this Agreement, but subject to Section 7.3(c), no Party will be relieved or
released from liability for damages of any kind that would otherwise have been
paid and the benefits that would have accrued arising out of any (i) knowing
material breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement
or (ii) deliberate material breach of any covenant of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Section 7.2, (x) a "knowing" breach of a representation and
warranty will be deemed to have occurred only if an executive officer of the
Party alleged to have breached had actual knowledge of such breach as of the
date of this Agreement (without any independent duty of investigation or
verification other than an actual reading of the representations and
warranties as they appear in this Agreement by such Party's executive officer)
and (y) a "deliberate" breach of any covenant will be deemed to have occurred
only if an executive officer of the Party alleged to have breached took or
failed to take action with actual knowledge that there was a substantial
likelihood that the action so taken or omitted to be taken constituted a
breach of such covenant or reasonably should have known that an action or
failure to take action resulted in a substantial likelihood of such breach.
For purposes of this Section 7.2, an "executive officer" will have the meaning
given to the term "officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").

to Section 7.1(b) or by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and (y) (A) after the
date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, the Company receives a
Competing Proposal from a third party that is publicly disclosed or a third
party has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make
a Competing Proposal and (B) within 12 months after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
such third party and the Competing Proposal contemplated thereby is
consummated, then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer the
Termination Fee contemporaneously with the earlier of the execution of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of the transaction
arising from such Competing Proposal (except that for purposes of this Section
7.3(a)(i), the references to "15%" in the definition of "Competing Proposal"

cause to be paid, to Buyer the Termination Fee concurrently with such

expenses up to $1,500,000 accrued from the date hereof through the date of

(including the Financing).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
Buyer's right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 7.3 will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Buyer and Merger Sub against (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the
former, current and future holders of any equity, partnership or limited
liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders, assignees of the Company or any of its

Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Company Related
Parties") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company
Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (except that the Company
will also be obligated with respect to Section 7.3(d)).

  

  

(d) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Buyer in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3
and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the payment of the Termination Fee, the
Company will pay Buyer its reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

7.4 Procedure For Termination. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 will, in order to be effective, require action by the terminating
Party's board of directors. A terminating Party will provide written notice of
termination to the other Parties specifying with reasonable particularity the
basis for such termination. If more than one provision in Section 7.1 is
available to a terminating Party in connection with a termination, a
terminating Party may rely on any or all available provisions in Section 7.1
for any termination.

the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and derivative or similar

delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any Party will affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any such Exhibit or Schedule.

  

  

IX. MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

9.1 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement and any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto by any Party hereto will terminate at
the Effective Time or, except as provided in Section 7.2, upon the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be, except that
this Section 9.1 will not limit any covenant of the Parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time or after termination of this
Agreement, including those contained in Section 5.4 (Indemnification and
Insurance) and Section 5.5 (Employment Matters).

  

  

9.2 Waiver. Any Party may, at any time prior to the Closing, by action taken
by its Board of Directors, or officers thereunto duly authorized, waive any of
the terms or conditions of this Agreement in writing executed by Buyer
(without the joinder of Merger Sub) or the Company, as the case may be, in the
same manner as this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party.

9.4 Assignment. No Party hereto may assign or delegate this Agreement or any
part hereof without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except
that any consent by Buyer will not require the joinder of Merger Sub; provided
that Buyer or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to its Affiliates so long
as such assignment does not relieve Buyer of any liability or obligation
hereunder. Any assignment or delegation

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-58-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

in violation of this Section 9.4 will be void and of no effect. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation may assign all of their respective rights to payment under this
Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing
to Buyer pursuant to the Commitment Letter, but no such assignment will
relieve Buyer of any liability or obligation hereunder.

  

  

9.5 Rights of Third Parties. Except for the provisions of Sections 5.4, 5.14,
7.3(c), 9.12, 9.15, and 9.16, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement
is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than
the Parties, any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.2 without
notice or liability to any other Person. Persons other than the Parties hereto
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  

  

9.6 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party will bear its
own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
whether or not such Transactions are consummated, including all fees of its
legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants; provided, that all
Transaction Expenses will (i) be the Equity Holders' responsibility and (ii)
be paid by Buyer at the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2(d).

  

  

9.7 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws
principles that would result in the application of any Law other than the Law
of the State of Delaware.

  

  

9.8 Captions; Counterparts. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience
only and will not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Schedules, Exhibits
and Annexes to this Agreement) and the letter agreement between
1-800-FLOWERS.COM, INC. and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement")
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties relating to the Transactions
and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have
been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to the Transactions. The Parties negotiated
this Agreement with the assistance of professional advisors and intend that
the Agreement encompass the entire relationship among them. As such, the
Parties hereby confirm that there are no, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, hereby expressly waive and disclaim, extra-contractual rights
or obligations among them, including arising under theories of implied duties
of good faith or fair dealing, actual or constructive fraud or other theories.

9.10 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed by Buyer
(without the joinder of Merger Sub) and the Company in the same manner as this
Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The approval of this
Agreement by the Common Shareholders will not restrict the ability of the
Board to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 or to cause
the Company to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.10 to the extent permitted under the DGCL.

  

  

9.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The Parties further agree
that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under applicable Law, they will take any actions
necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent
necessary, will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid
and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the Parties.

  

  

9.12 Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) Any action, suit or proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to

court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the federal
courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court of the

Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court
in any such action, suit or proceeding, waives any objection it may now or
hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum,
agrees that all claims in respect of the action, suit or proceeding will be
heard and determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any

or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other Party
in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any
action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 9.12(a).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.12(a), each of the Parties (i) agrees that it
will not bring or support any Person in any action, suit or proceeding of any
kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the Financing contemplated thereby, in any forum

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-60-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

other than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York, (ii) agrees that, except as
specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of
action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof or the Financing contemplated thereby, will be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of New York, without regard to the conflict of laws principles that
would result in the application of any Law other than the Law of the State of
New York, and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right
such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether
in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof or the Financing contemplated thereby. The debt
Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section
9.12(b), Section 9.13 and Section 9.16.

  

  

9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT
IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF
ACTION OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR
INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY
THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO THAT THIS SECTION 9.13 CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THEY ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS
SECTION 9.13 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH
PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  

  

9.14 Enforcement.

  

  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which any
party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is brought
in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party will allege,
and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
Law. Subject to the foregoing, each Party hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
such Party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this
Agreement. The Parties further agree that by seeking the remedies provided for
in this Section 9.14, a Party will not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event
that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this Section 9.14 are not available or otherwise are not
granted.

  

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-61-  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  


 

  

(b) In no event will the Company seek any money damages or any other recovery,
judgment or damages of any kind, in an amount in excess of the Purchase Price.

  

  

9.15 Company Professional Advisors. Each Party hereby acknowledges, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that each of the Company Professional
Advisors may advise and represent the Company and its Affiliates in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions, and that, following consummation of
the Transactions, each of the Company Professional Advisors may advise and
represent a former Common Shareholder or any of their respective Affiliates,
if such Persons so request, in connection with any Action or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and each
Party hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each Party and their respective Boards of Directors (or
committees thereof) will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive
any conflict of interest arising from any such representation. Buyer and
Merger Sub agree that, as to all communications between all counsel for the
Company and/or its Affiliates (including any Company Professional Advisors
that are legal counsel), and the Company and/or any of its respective
Affiliates that relate in any way to the Transactions or this Agreement
(collectively, the "Privileged Communications"), the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence with respect to the Privileged
Communications belongs to Common Shareholders and will not pass to or be
claimed by Buyer, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. From and after the Closing none of the Surviving Corporation,
its Subsidiaries or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries will seek to obtain such
communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
or through other means. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Subsidiaries together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns further agree that no such party may use or rely on any
of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving the Common
Shareholders or any of their Affiliates after the Closing. The Privileged
Communications may be used by the Common Shareholders and/or any of its
Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates to the Transaction or
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a Party or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by counsel to such third party, provided that neither the
Surviving Corporation nor its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of a majority of the Common Shareholders.

9.16 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the Transactions may only be brought against, the entities that are expressly
named as Parties and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such Party, except that nothing herein will limit
the rights and remedies of any Party or its Affiliates under the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Support Agreement.

  

  

9.17 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
