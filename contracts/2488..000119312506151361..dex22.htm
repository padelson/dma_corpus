v _ACQUISITION AGREEMENT_

ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
July 23, 2006, among Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), 1252986 Alberta ULC, an unlimited liability company formed under
the laws of Alberta (" _Parent SubCo_ "), and ATI Technologies Inc., a
corporation continued under the laws of Canada (the " _Company_ ").

_RECITALS_

WHEREAS, (i) the Board of Directors of Parent has deemed it advisable and in
the best interests of its stockholders and (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company has deemed it fair to the shareholders of the Company and holders of
outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs and in the best interests of the
Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to
effect the acquisition provided for herein in which Parent SubCo acquires all
of the outstanding common shares of the Company (the " _Company Common Shares_
") pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Board of Directors of each of
Parent and the Company has approved the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company has agreed upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein (i) to submit a special resolution, substantially
in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the " _Arrangement Resolution_ "), to the
holders of the Company Common Shares (the " _Company Common Shareholders_
"), for approval, and (ii) to submit the Plan of Arrangement to the Ontario
Superior Court of Justice (the " _Court_ ") for approval; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

GENERAL

 

1.1 _Implementation Steps by the Company._

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company will apply,
in a manner reasonably acceptable to Parent, to the Court under Section 192 of
the Canada Business Corporations Act (the " _CBCA_ ") for an order approving
the arrangement (the " _Arrangement_ ") on the terms and subject to the
conditions set out in the plan of arrangement (the " _Plan of Arrangement_ ")
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (as such order may be amended
or varied at any time prior to the Effective Time or, if appealed, then unless
such appeal is withdrawn or denied, as affirmed or as amended on appeal at the
direction of the Court, the " _Final Order_ "), and for an interim order of
the Court, as the same may be amended (the " _Interim Order_ "), in respect of
the Arrangement, as contemplated by Section 1.2.

(b) The Company shall, subject to obtaining the Interim Order and in the
manner contemplated by Section 3.3, convene and hold a special meeting of the
Company Common Shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ "), including any
adjournment or postponement    thereof, to be called and held in accordance with the Interim Order to
consider the Arrangement Resolution (and for any other proper purpose as may
be set out in the notice for such meeting and agreed to by Parent acting
reasonably).

(c) The Company shall, subject to obtaining the approvals as are required by
the Interim Order, proceed with and diligently pursue the application to the
Court for the Final Order approving the Arrangement.

(d) The Company shall, subject to obtaining the Final Order and the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article IV_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), send to the Director
appointed pursuant to Section 260 of the CBCA (the " _Director_ "), for
endorsement and filing by the Director, the articles of arrangement (the "
_Articles of Arrangement_ ") and such other documents as may be required in
connection therewith under the CBCA to give effect to the Arrangement.

1.2 _Interim Order_. The notice of motion for the application referred to in
Section 1.1(a) shall request that the Interim Order provide:

(a) for the class of persons to whom notice is to be provided in respect of
the Arrangement and the Company Meeting and for the manner in which
such notice is to be provided;

(b) that the requisite approval for the Arrangement Resolution shall be 66
2/3% of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by Company Common
Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Company
Meeting;

(c) that, in all other respects, the terms, restrictions and conditions of the
Organizational Documents of the Company, including quorum requirements and
all other matters, shall apply in respect of the Company Meeting; and

(d) for the grant of the rights of dissent in respect of the Arrangement
described in Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement (the " _Dissent Rights_ ").

1.3 _Circular; S-8 Registration Statement._ (a) As promptly as practicable
after execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in preparing a management information circular of the Company with
respect to the Company Meeting (together with any amendments and supplements
thereto, the _"Circular"_ ), together with any documents required by the
Securities Laws, or other applicable Laws in connection with the Arrangement
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall
furnish to the Company all information relating to Parent as may be reasonably
requested by the Company to prepare the Circular ( _"Parent Information"_ ).
As promptly as practicable after the Company receives the Interim Order, the
Company shall cause the Circular to be sent to each Company Common Shareholder
and holder of Company Options and Company RSUs entitled to vote at the
Company Meeting and filed as required by the Interim Order and applicable
Laws.

(b) The Company shall ensure that the Circular complies with all applicable
Laws and any requirements of the Interim Order and that none of the
information relating to the  



 

2  Company (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding Parent Information) included
or incorporated by reference in the Circular (" _Company Information_ "), at
the date of mailing to the Company Common Shareholders and at the time of the
Company Meeting contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading. Parent shall ensure that none of the Parent Information
provided by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Circular, at the date of mailing to the Company Common Shareholders and at
the time of the Company Meeting contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company (with respect to Company Information)
and Parent (with respect to Parent Information) shall ensure that the
Circular provides the Company Common Shareholders with information in
sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the
matters to be placed before them at the Company Meeting. Each of the Company
and Parent will, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
such other party with copies of written comments and advise such other party
of any oral comments with respect to the Circular received from the Director
or the Court and of any request by the Director or the Court for amendments
or supplements to the Circular or for additional information. Parent and the
Company shall each promptly notify each other if at any time before or after
the Effective Time it becomes aware that the Circular or an application for
an order or a registration covered by this Section 1.3 contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading, or that
otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to the Circular or such
application or registration. In any such event, (i) the Company shall, to the
extent required by Law, seek an appropriate amendment to the Interim Order,
and (ii) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation of a
supplement or amendment to the Circular or to such other document, as
required, and if required, the Company shall cause the same to be distributed
to the Company Common Shareholders entitled to vote at the Company Meeting and
the Company shall cause the same to be filed with the relevant securities
regulatory authorities.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (the " _S-8 Registration Statement_ ")
with the SEC to register the Parent Common Stock to be issued from time to
time after the Effective Time upon delivery of Parent Common Stock underlying
Company RSUs assumed by Parent or upon exercise of options issued in exchange
for Company Options pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of the S-8 Registration Statement for so long as options issued in exchange
for Company Options or any Company RSUs remain outstanding.

(d) Parent and the Company shall take any action required to be taken under
any applicable federal, provincial, territorial or state securities Laws
(including "blue sky" Laws) in connection with the issuance of Parent Common
Stock and the Arrangement; _provided, however,_ that neither Parent nor the
Company shall be required by reason of the foregoing to register or qualify
as a foreign corporation or reporting issuer in any jurisdiction where either
Parent or the Company is not now so registered or qualified.



 

3 1.4 _Dissenting Shareholders_. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice
of any written notice exercising Dissent Rights, withdrawals of the exercise
of such rights and any other instruments given pursuant to the CBCA and
received by the Company in connection with the Arrangement or the Company
Meeting and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of such Dissent Rights to the extent
that the Company is proposing to make any payments to such Company Common
Shareholders. Without the prior written consent of Parent, except as required
by applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any such rights or offer to settle or settle
any such rights.

1.5 _Effects of the Arrangement on Company Shares, Company Options, Company
RSUs, Company DSUs and Company SARs._ Each Company Share, Company Option,
Company RSU, Company DSU and Company SAR will be dealt with as provided in the
Plan of Arrangement.

1.6 _Canadian Securities Exemption Orders_. Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain all orders required from the applicable Canadian securities
regulatory authorities to permit the issuance and first resale of Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to the Arrangement without qualification with or
approval of or the filing of any prospectus, or the taking of any proceeding
with, or the obtaining of any further order, ruling or consent from any
Governmental Entity under any Canadian federal, provincial or territorial
securities or other Laws or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
Governmental Entity administering such Laws or the fulfillment of any other
legal requirement in any such jurisdiction (other than, with respect to such
first resales, any restrictions or transfer by reason of, among other things,
a holder being a "control person" of Parent for purposes of Canadian federal,
provincial or territorial securities Laws).

1.7 _Closing_. The closing of the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices
of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025, on the
second Business Day after which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article IV (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date
as the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

ARTICLE II.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

2.1  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except (x) as set forth
in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter
delivered to Parent by the Company prior to the date hereof (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") or in any other section or subsection thereof where the
relevance of the information in such other section or subsection is readily
apparent on its face or (y) as set forth in the body of the Company Reports
that are publicly available in electronic form on the SECs website and filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof, the Company hereby represents and

in each jurisdiction (if applicable in such jurisdiction) where the ownership

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. The Company
has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the certificate
and articles of continuance, articles of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent

do business.

consists of (A) an unlimited number of Company Common Shares and (B) an
unlimited number of preference shares, issuable in series (" _Company
Preferred Shares_ ").

the ATI Technologies Inc. Restricted Share Unit Plans for Canadian Directors

Company has filed with or furnished to the Canadian Securities Regulatory

proxy circulars required to be filed or furnished by the Company
under applicable Securities Laws (collectively, including any other reports
filed with or furnished to the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities, the
TSX and SEC subsequent to the date hereof, the " _Company Reports_ "). The
Company Reports are publicly and freely available on either www.sedar.com or
the SECs website. The Company Reports, at the time filed or furnished (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such filing), complied, and each such Company Report filed or furnished
subsequent to the date hereof will comply, in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable Securities Laws and did not, and will not, at the
time furnished or filed contain any misrepresentation (as defined in the
Securities Laws, as applicable) or any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company has not filed any
confidential material change report with the Canadian Securities Regulatory
Authorities or any other securities authority or regulator or any stock
exchange or other self-regulatory authority which as of the date hereof
remains confidential. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file
any reports or other documents with any of the Canadian Securities Regulatory
Authorities, TSX or SEC. The Company is a "foreign private issuer" as defined
in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act.

(ii) The annual audited consolidated financial statements and the quarterly
unaudited consolidated financial statements, including in each case, any
related notes thereto, contained in the Company Reports (the " _Company
Financial Statements_ ") complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the Canadian Securities Regulatory
Authorities, TSX, SEC and NASDAQ with respect thereto as of their respective
dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such filing), and have been prepared in accordance
with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (" _Canadian GAAP"_ )
applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and
consistent with each other (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto).
The Company Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring
year-end adjustments that are not expected to be material in amount and the
absence of notes thereto) on a consolidated basis.

(iii) The Company (A) makes and keeps books, records and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company; and (B) devises and maintains a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (I) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization; (II) transactions are recorded as necessary
(x) to



 

8 permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
Canadian GAAP or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (y) to
maintain accountability for assets; (III) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (IV)
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. The Company has (A) established and maintained disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer by
others within those entities. The Company has disclosed in its annual report
on Form 40-F for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005 any change in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2005 that materially affected, or was reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005. The Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2005, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee
of the Companys board of directors: (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which were reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involved
management or other employees who had a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. The Company is developing
and executing, and throughout the period between signing and Closing will
continue to develop and execute, processes, policies and procedures to comply
with the requirements of Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related
rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 404_ ") as of the date by which
it is required to comply. The Company has no reason to believe that (i) it
will not be able to comply with Section 404 as of such date or (ii) that
there will be any material weaknesses disclosed in the report of management
on the Companys internal control over financial reporting or the related
attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting
firm to be included in the Companys annual report on Form 40-F for the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, filed with the SEC. As of the date hereof,
to the Companys knowledge there are no significant deficiencies (as defined
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.

applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and (B) applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the TSX and NASDAQ.

supplementary unemployment benefit or other material plan, program,
policy, arrangement or understanding (whether or not legally binding)
maintained, contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed to by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that together with
the Company, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b) of the United States Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") but excluding the Canada
Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, any health or drug plan established
and administered by a Province and workers compensation insurance provided by
federal or provincial legislation or a comparable program, regardless of
whether the Code or ERISA are applicable to such Person (each, a " _Commonly
Controlled Entity_ "), in each case providing benefits to any current or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and all amendments and supplements thereto (collectively, the "
_Employee Plans_ ") together with, as applicable, accurate and complete copies
of all funding agreements and any Contracts relating to such Employee Plans
(including service provider agreements, insurance contracts, minimum premium
contracts, stop-loss agreements, investment management agreements,
subscription and participation agreements and recordkeeping agreements), all
summary descriptions of the Employee Plans provided to past or present
participants therein, the two most recent actuarial reports, any annual
information returns required to be filed under applicable Law, the financial
statements, if any, and evidence of any registration in respect
thereof. Section 2.1(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of each Employee Plan that is an "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA regardless of whether ERISA
is applicable thereto) (sometimes referred to herein as a " _Company Pension
Plan_ "), each Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA regardless of whether ERISA is applicable
thereto) and all other Employee Plans. Section 2.1(j)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter also identifies each applicable Law pursuant to which any of
the Company or its Affiliates is required to establish any reserve or make
any contribution for the benefit of any current or former employee located in
any jurisdiction.

(ii) No condition or circumstance since the date of the documents provided in
accordance with Section 2.1(j)(i) above would materially affect the
information contained therein and, in particular, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no promises or commitments have been made by the
Company or its Subsidiaries and no plans exist to materially amend any
Employee Plan or to provide increased benefits thereunder to any employee,
except as required by applicable Law.



 

14 (iii) All of the Employee Plans are, and have been since their establishment,
duly registered where required by Law (including registration with the
relevant tax authorities where such registration is required to qualify for
tax exemption or other beneficial tax status) and are in good standing under,
and in material compliance with ERISA, the Code, all other applicable Laws,
administrative guidance issued by regulatory authorities, and the terms of all
collective bargaining agreements.

(iv) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has ever sponsored, maintained,
contributed to or has been required to contribute to a pension plan registered
under the Income Tax Act (Canada). All Company Pension Plans intended to
be tax-qualified in the United States have received favorable determination
letters from the United States Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with
respect to "TRA" (as defined in Section 1 of United States Internal Revenue
Procedure 93-39), and have timely filed with the IRS determination letter
applications with respect to "GUST" (as defined in Section 1 of United States
Internal Revenue Notice 2001-42), to effect that such Company Pension Plans
are qualified and exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has been
revoked (or has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since
the date of the most recent determination letter or application therefore
relating to any such Company Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualification of such Company Pension Plan or materially
increase the costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of
ERISA. In addition, all Company Pension Plans have been amended to comply with
the requirements of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001. All Company Pension Plans required to have been approved by any
regulatory authority have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked
(or has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date
of the most recent approval or application therefore relating to any such
Company Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to materially affect
any such approval relating thereto or materially increase the costs relating
thereto.

(v) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Commonly Controlled Entity
has (A) maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to any
Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
or (B) has any unsatisfied liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of
any Commonly Controlled Entity has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived.

(vi) All Employee Plans have been materially administered in accordance with
their terms, there are no outstanding defaults or violations by any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries of any obligation required to be performed by
it in connection with any Employee Plan and no order has been made or notice
given pursuant to any Laws requiring (or proposing to require) any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to take (or refrain from taking) any action in
respect of any Employee Plan.



 

15 (vii) All returns, filings, reports and disclosures relating to the Employee
Plans required to be filed or distributed, pursuant to the terms of the
Employee Plans, Laws or any regulatory authority, have been filed or
distributed in accordance with all requirements, all filing fees and levies
imposed on the Employee Plans by regulatory authorities or Laws have been
made on a timely basis and the funds of the Employee Plans are not exposed to
any late filing fees that have not been remitted.

(viii) There are no actions, suits, claims, trials, demands, investigations,
arbitrations or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to the Employee Plans against any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, the funding agent, the insurers or the fund of such
Employee Plans, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course.

(ix) To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no condition
or circumstance exists that has resulted or, could result in any Employee Plan
being ordered or required to be terminated or wound-up in whole or in part or
having its registration under any Laws being refused or revoked or being
placed under the administration of any trustee or receiver or any regulatory
authority or being required to pay any material taxes or penalties under any
Laws.

(x) No event has occurred and there has been no failure to act on the part of
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any administrator of any of
the Employee Plans that could subject any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
to the imposition of any tax, penalty or other disability with respect to any
Employee Plans, whether by way of indemnity or otherwise. With respect to each
Employee Plan, (A) there has not occurred any prohibited transaction (within
the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees or any
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Employee Plan, or any agent
of the foregoing that would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any of their respective employees, or a
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created under any
Employee Plan, to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA and
(B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Employee
Plan nor any agent of the forgoing, has engaged in any transaction or acted in
a manner, or failed to act in a manner that would subject the Company or its
Subsidiaries or, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary, to any
material liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other
applicable Law. No Employee Plan or related trust has been terminated, nor, to
the knowledge of the Company, has there been any "reportable event" (as that
term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived with respect to any Employee Plan during the
last five years, and no notice of a reportable event will be required to be
filed in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(xi) None of the Employee Plans is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) regardless of ERISAs applicability thereto) or a multi-
employer benefit plan.



 

16 (xii) Section 2.1(j)(xii) of the Company Disclosure Letter discloses whether
each Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA (regardless of the applicability of ERISA to such
Employee Plan)) is (A) unfunded or self-insured, (B) funded through a "welfare
benefit fund," as such term is defined in Section 410(e) of the Code
(regardless of whether the Code is applicable thereto), or other funding
mechanism or (C) insured. Each such employee welfare benefit plan may be
amended or terminated (including with respect to benefits provided to
retirees and other former employees) without material liability (other than
benefits then payable under such plan without regard to such amendment or
termination) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time after the
Effective Time. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries complies with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar
applicable Law with respect to each applicable Employee Plan. No Employee
Plan provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or not insured) with
respect to any current or former employee or director of any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries after any termination of service of such employee or
director (other than for continuation coverage required under Section
4980B(f) or similar applicable Law).

(xiii) None of the Employee Plans require or permit a retroactive increase in
premiums or payments, and the level of insurance reserves, if any, under any
self-insured Employee Plan is reasonable and sufficient to provide for all
incurred but unreported claims. All employer and employee obligations in
respect of the Employee Plans, including payments, contributions and premiums
required under applicable Laws and their terms have been satisfied. Neither
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Arrangement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will result in any bonus, golden parachute, severance or other
payment or obligation to any current or former employee or director of any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether or not under any Employee Plan), or
materially increase the benefits payable or provided under any Employee Plan,
or result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits. The Company has delivered and disclosed to Parent any and all
copies (or accurate and complete descriptions thereof if unwritten) of
Employee Plans, together with, as applicable, accurate and complete copies of
any and all Contracts, for Parent to make a good faith estimate of the total
amount of all payments and the fair market value of all non-cash benefits that
may become payable or provided to any director, officer, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Employee
Plans (assuming for such purpose that such individuals employment were
terminated immediately following the Effective Time).

(xiv) The Company has delivered to Parent (A) correct and accurate summaries,
as of the date of this Agreement, including, separately by country, the number
of employees and contractors of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
aggregate annual salary, wages and fees paid to such employees, the aggregate
annual amount of all other compensation payable to such employees or
contractors (including compensation payable pursuant to bonus, deferred
compensation or commission arrangements) and the average length of service
for such employees or contractors; (B) a list, as of the date of this
Agreement, of each of the officers of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that correctly reflects, in all material respects, such officers base
salary, any other compensation payable to such officer (including, without
limitation, compensation payable pursuant to bonus, deferred compensation or
commission arrangements), such officers date of employment, such officers
position and such officers country of residence and principal employment; and
(C) a list of each outstanding  



 

17  Company Equity Award granted to any officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, including the holder, the date of grant, the type of Company
Equity Award, the exercise or purchase price, the number of Company Common
Shares subject to vested Company Equity Awards, the number of Company Common
Shares subject to unvested Company Equity Awards and the Company Stock Plan
pursuant to which such Company Equity Award was granted. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, whether absolute or contingent,
including any obligations under any Employee Plans, with respect to any
misclassification of a Person performing services for the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as an independent contractor rather than as an employee.

(xv) There are no agreements for the payment of any pension, bonus, share of
profits, retirement allowance, insurance, hospitalization or other benefits
for any of the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except as set out
in Section 2.1(j)(xv) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(xvi) No deduction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any
"applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by reason of
Section 162(m) of the Code or is an "excess parachute payment" pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code. 

(xvii) All amounts owing in respect of employee payroll withholding
obligations, remittances, premiums, contributions and assessments under
provincial or federal statutes or employee benefit plans have been fully
accrued in the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
wages, vacation pay, holiday pay and employee benefits of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been fully accrued in the Companys books
and records and reflected as such in the Companys financial statements.

(xviii) No payment pursuant to any Employee Plans or other arrangement to any
"service provider" (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and
the United States Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance
thereunder), including the grant, vesting, modification or exercise of any
Company Equity Award, would subject any Person to tax pursuant to Section
409A(1) of the Code, whether pursuant to the consummation of the Arrangement,
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

(xix) All Company Equity Awards have been appropriately authorized by the
Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, including approval
of the exercise or purchase price or the methodology for determining the
exercise or purchase price and the substantive terms of the Company Equity
Awards. All Company Options granted to employees in the United States reflect
the fair market value of the Companys Common Shares as determined under
Section 409A of the Code on the date the option was granted (within the
meaning of United States Treasury Regulation §1.421-1(c)). No Company Equity
Awards have been retroactively granted, or the exercise or purchase price of
any Company Equity Award determined retroactively.

(xx) The Company has registered all Company Equity Awards, whether or not
currently outstanding, pursuant to one or more S-8 Registration Statements
that the Company is required to register under applicable Law, and the
Company has maintained the effectiveness of such S-8 Registration Statements.

fail to be operative upon command of or by design by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (b) any code containing viruses, trojan horses, worms, or

available to third parties or to publish source code. Except as disclosed in
Section 2.1(p)(vii)(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company

in or relating to all of its properties and other assets (other than
Intellectual Property Rights, which are governed by Section 2.1(p)) necessary
for the conduct of its business as currently conducted, except for such
property or other assets where the failure to do so individually or in the
aggregate do not materially interfere with the value or use of the property or
the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their business as
currently conducted. All such properties and other assets are held free and

not materially interfere with the value or use of the property or the ability

conducted.

respects with the terms of all leases or subleases to which it is a party and

interfere with the value or use of the property or the ability of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses as currently conducted.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received as lessee any
written notice from the lessor of any event or occurrence that has resulted or
could result (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both)
in a material default with respect to any such lease or sublease.

(r) _Customers_. Section 2.1(r) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
the twenty (20) largest customers (including OEMs, systems integrators and
value added resellers, as  



 

25  well as other direct and indirect customers) by revenue of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, and for the nine-
month period ended April 30, 2006. To the Companys knowledge, no such
customer intends to terminate or materially adversely change its relationship
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(s) _Vote Required_. Subject to the discretion of the Court, the Company
Requisite Vote is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Companys securities necessary or required to approve the Arrangement.

(t) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither the Company nor any of its officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement
except that the Company has employed Credit Suisse First Boston and Genuity
Capital Markets as its financial advisors, the arrangements with which have
been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof. The fees and expenses of
financial advisors (including Credit Suisse First Boston and Genuity Capital
Markets) and legal counsel (including Shearman and Sterling and Goodmans LLP)
retained by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby incurred or to be incurred by the Company will not exceed
the amount set forth in Section 2.1(t) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(u)  _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of
Credit Suisse First Boston, financial advisor to the Company, to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion, the Transaction Consideration to be
received by the Company Common Shareholders is fair to the Company Common
Shareholders from a financial point of view.

2.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent._ Except (x) as set forth in
the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered
to the Company by Parent prior to the date hereof (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ ") or in any other section or subsection thereof where the relevance
of the information in such other section or subsection is readily apparent on
its face, or (y) as set forth in the body of the Parent Reports that are
publicly available in electronic form on the SECs website and filed with the
SEC prior to the date hereof, Parent hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that:

(a)  _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization (if
applicable in such jurisdiction) and has all requisite corporate or similar
power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction (if applicable
in such jurisdiction) where the ownership or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to have such power or authority when taken together with
all other such failures, could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement. Parent has made available to the Company
a complete and correct copy of the Organizational Documents of Parent and its
significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X,
promulgated by the SEC), each as amended to the date hereof. Parents and its
Subsidiaries Organizational  



 

26  Documents so made available are in full force and effect. Section 2.2(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of
each jurisdiction where Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (other than any
Subsidiaries that have no operations and have no employees) is organized and
qualified to do business.

(b) _Capital Structure_. (i) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
of (A) 750,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share (the " _Parent Preferred Stock_ ").
As of June 30, 2006, 492,265,526 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and
outstanding (including 6,701,918 shares held in treasury), no shares of
Parent Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, employee stock options to
purchase an aggregate of 31,537,725 shares of Parent Common Stock were
outstanding (of which options to purchase to purchase an aggregate
of 24,344,148 shares of Parent Common Stock were exercisable), and restricted
stock and restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of 3,288,914 shares
of Parent Common Stock were outstanding (of which restricted stock and
restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of 64,818 shares of Parent
Common Stock were vested). All outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. The authorized capital stock of Parent SubCo consists of an
unlimited number of common shares, 100 of which are issued and outstanding as
of the date hereof. All such common shares of Parent SubCo have been duly
authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable. Each
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent SubCo and each of
Parents other Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any Lien.

(ii) Except as set forth above, for changes since June 30, 2006 resulting from
the exercise of stock options or the grant of stock based compensation to
employees, as provided for under this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement
and as may be permitted to be issued, delivered or sold after the date hereof
in accordance with Section 3.1(b), there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue or to sell any shares of capital stock or other
securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights
are authorized, issued or outstanding.

(iii) Parent does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the holders of Parent Common Stock on any matter.

(c) _Corporate Authority and Approval_. (i) Each of Parent and Parent SubCo
has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate
action necessary (and no vote of the holders of outstanding Parent Common
Stock is necessary) in order to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. Assuming this Agreement
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, this
Agreement is a valid and 



 

27  binding agreement of Parent and Parent SubCo, enforceable against Parent and
Parent SubCo in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
enforceability may be subject to (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and (B) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(ii) The Parent Common Stock, when issued (A) in accordance with this
Agreement and the Arrangement, (B) upon the exercise of (x) options issued in
exchange for Company Options and (y) Company SARs pursuant to this Agreement
and the Arrangement or (C) upon the vesting of Company RSUs and Company
Restricted Shares with respect to Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for
Company RSUs and Company Restricted Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the
Arrangement will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no
stockholder of Parent will have any preemptive right of subscription or
purchase in respect thereof. The Parent Common Stock, when issued as described
in clause (A) of the preceding sentence, will be exempt from registration
under the Securities Act and registered or exempt from registration under any
applicable U.S. state securities or "blue sky" Laws or Canadian provincial or
territorial securities laws.

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations._ (i) Other than the filings, notices
and/or approvals (A) under the HSR Act, (B) under the Securities Laws, (C) to
comply with U.S. state securities or "blue sky" Laws or Canadian provincial
or territorial securities laws, (D) as may be required by the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") in respect of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement and
the listing of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE, (E) under the Investment
Canada Act and the Competition Act, and (F) under the antitrust and/or
notification laws of any other jurisdiction, where required, no notices,
reports or other filings are required to be made by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with, and no consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity, in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, except where
the failure to make any such notice, report or filing or obtain any such
consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization, individually or in
the aggregate, could not be reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Arrangement.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent do
not, and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Arrangement will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach
or violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under,
the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien, on the assets
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time
or both) pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Laws or governmental or non-governmental permit or license
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in
the rights or obligations of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in
the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation, default,
acceleration, creation or change that, individually or in the aggregate,
could not be reasonably be expected to  



 

28  have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.

(e) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements._ (i) Since December 25, 2005 (the
_"Parent Audit Date_ "), Parent has filed each report or proxy statement
required to be filed by Parent with the SEC since such date (collectively,
including any other reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof and as amended, the " _Parent Reports_ "), including (x) Parents
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2005 and (y)
Parents Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 26, 2006
(including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto). The Parent Reports
are publicly and freely available on the SECs website, or copies thereof have
otherwise been or, for Parent Reports filed after the date hereof will
otherwise be, provided to the Company. The Parent Reports, at the time filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of hereof, then on
the date of such filing), complied, and each Parent Report filed subsequent to
the date hereof will comply, in all material respects with the requirements
of applicable Securities Laws and did not, and will not, at the time furnished
or filed, contain any misrepresentation (as defined in the Securities Laws, as
applicable) or any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(ii) The annual audited consolidated financial statements and the quarterly
unaudited consolidated financial statements, including in each case,
any related notes thereto, contained in the Parent Reports (the " _Parent
Financial Statements_ ") complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC and NYSE with respect thereto as of
their respective dates, and have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") applied on a
basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each
other (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto). The Parent Financial
Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments
that are not expected to be material in amount and the absence of notes
thereto) on a consolidated basis.

(iii) The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in all material
respects, (x) have been maintained in accordance with good business practices
on a basis consistent with prior years, (y) state in reasonable detail the
material transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and (z) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for the
Parent Reports. Parent has (A) established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries is made
known to Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, and (B) designed and maintains a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements, including that (I) transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization and (II) transactions are
recorded as necessary (x) to permit preparation of consolidated financial
statements in  



 

29  conformity with U.S. GAAP and (y) to maintain accountability of the assets
of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The management of Parent has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of Parents board of directors (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting.

(iv) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with (A) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
prior to the date hereof, since the Parent Audit Date, Parent and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have
not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary
and usual course of such businesses and there has not been:

(i) any change in the financial condition, business, operations or results of
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any development or
combination of developments that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement;

(ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in cash, stock or property in respect of the capital stock of
Parent; or

(iii) any change in any material method of accounting or accounting practice
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any such change required by
reason of a concurrent change in U.S. GAAP or Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act.

(g) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable
or otherwise, and to the knowledge of Parent there is no existing condition,
situation or set of circumstances that could reasonably be expected to the
knowledge of Parent to result in such a liability or obligation other than:

(i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the Parent
Reports prior to date hereof;

(ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary and usual course of
business since the Parent Audit Date; and 

(iii) liabilities or obligations that could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



 

30 (h) _Parent Material Contracts_. (i) Except as filed as exhibits to the Parent
Reports, this Agreement or the Financing Commitment, none of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract which, as of the date
hereof (A) would prohibit or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Arrangement, or (B) is a
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC. Each Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound of the type
described in this Section 2.2(h), whether or not set forth in Section 2.2(h)
of the Parent Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a " _Parent Material
Contract_." 

(ii) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding according to its terms
on Parent and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to Parents
knowledge, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except,
insofar as this representation is made as of the Closing Date, as could not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Parent, no other party to any Parent Material Contract
intends to terminate, not renew, or challenge the validity or enforceability
of any Parent Material Contract, except for such terminations, non-renewals or
challenges as could not be reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no other party thereto, is in
violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default under) any Parent Material Contract to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(i) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports prior to the date
hereof, there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could result
in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement.

(j) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
prior to the date hereof, the businesses of each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Laws, except for
any violation that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. Except as disclosed in the
Parent Reports prior to the date hereof and except for any investigation or
review that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has
any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to conduct the same. No material change is required in Parents
 



 

31  or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures in
connection with any Law, and Parent has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any Law that has not been
cured as of the date hereof. Parent and its Subsidiaries each has all permits,
licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental
authorizations, consents and approvals (the " _Parent Permits_ ") necessary
to conduct its business in all material respects as presently conducted,
except where the failure to have any such Parent Permits, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Arrangement.

(k) _Taxes._ Except as has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(i) (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have timely filed or caused to be filed
(taking into account any extension of time to file granted or obtained) all
Tax Returns required to be filed by them, and any such filed Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete, (b) Parent and its Subsidiaries have timely paid
any and all Taxes due and payable except to the extent that such Taxes are
being contested in good faith and for which Parent or the appropriate
Subsidiary has set aside adequate reserves in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (c)
without taking into account any transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and based upon activities to date, adequate reserves in accordance with U.S.
GAAP have been established by Parent and its Subsidiaries for all Taxes not
yet due and payable in respect of taxable periods ending on or before the date
hereof and (d) all amounts of Tax required to be withheld by Parent and its
Subsidiaries have been timely withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax
authority in accordance with applicable Laws.

(ii) No deficiency for any amount of Tax has been asserted or assessed by any
Tax authority in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or,
to the knowledge of Parent, has been threatened or proposed), except for
deficiencies which have been satisfied by payment, settled or been withdrawn
or which are being contested in good faith and are Taxes for which Parent or
the appropriate Subsidiary has set aside adequate reserves in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. There are no liens for any amount of Tax on the assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than liens for current Taxes and assessments
not yet past due.

(iii) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened Tax
audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings with respect
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been notified in writing, and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to an assessment or deficiency for Taxes (other than pursuant to
extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). There
are no requests for rulings or determinations in respect of any Taxes pending
between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and any Tax authority.

(iv) None of Parents Subsidiaries incorporated outside of the United States
is a "surrogate foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section
7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code or is treated as a U.S. corporation under Section
7874(b) of the Code.



 

32 (v) None of Parents Subsidiaries incorporated outside of the United States is
engaged in a United States trade or business, or is treated as being engaged
in a United States trade or business, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

(l)  _Available Funds_. Parent has made available to the Company a true,
accurate, complete and fully executed copy of a commitment letter (the "
_Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (the " _Lender_ ")
has committed to provide Parent with financing (the " _Financing_ "). As of
the date hereof, the Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and has
not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect and Parent is not in breach of any conditions set forth therein. There
are no facts and circumstances known on the date hereof to Parent or any of
Parents Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent the
conditions described in the Financing Commitment from being satisfied when
required or (ii) prevent Parent or Parent SubCo from receiving Financing
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitment in accordance with its
terms. The Lender has not advised Parent of any facts which cause it to
believe the Financing will not be consummated substantially in accordance with
the terms of the Financing Commitment. The proceeds from the Financing,
together with cash on hand, constitute all of the financing required to be
provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of Parents obligations to pay
the cash portion of the Transaction Consideration.

(m) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor any of its officers, directors
or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for
any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, except that
Parent has employed Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated as its financial
advisor, the arrangements with which have been disclosed to the Company prior
to the date hereof.

(n) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Parent has received the opinion of Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated, financial advisor to Parent, to the effect that,
as of the date of the opinion, the Transaction Consideration to be paid by
Parent is fair to Parent from a financial point of view.

conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity

request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written
materials subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which
constitutes, or that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly

received an Acquisition Proposal which constitutes, or that the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and (ii) the identity of the party making such Acquisition
Proposal and a description of the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal and may then take the following actions:

Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
containing standstill provisions and other terms and conditions that are no
less restrictive to such third party than the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such third party, the Company furnishes a copy of
such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished); and

Acquisition Proposal.

withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after the Companys
compliance with Section 3.2(e), if (i) the Company Requisite Vote has not been
obtained and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good
faith, following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, not terminating
this Agreement to accept such Superior Proposal and/or not recommending such
Superior Proposal to its shareholders would be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors fiduciary duties under the CBCA, the Company may terminate this
Agreement and its Board of Directors may recommend such Superior Proposal to
its shareholders after such termination, and concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement enter into any agreement, understanding, letter
of intent or arrangement with respect to such Superior Proposal, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this sentence, and any purported termination pursuant
to this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently
with such termination pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) the Company pays to
Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 5.2(c); _provided_ ,
_further_ , the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement and the Board of Directors shall not recommend a Superior Proposal
to its shareholders pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) unless the Company shall
be in compliance with its obligations under this Section 3.2 (including
paragraph (e)), other than an immaterial and unintentional violation of
paragraphs (a) or (c) of this Section 3.2.

(e) Prior to the Company terminating this Agreement, the Board of Directors of
the Company recommending any Superior Proposal to the Companys shareholders,
or the Company entering into any agreement, understanding, letter of intent or
arrangement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver
written notice (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") to Parent of its intent to
take any of the foregoing action and, for a period of five Business Days after
Parents receipt from the Company of each Superior Proposal Notice (or, in the
event that more than one Superior Proposal Notice becomes due with respect to
the same Acquisition Proposal, a period commencing from the date of such
Superior Proposal Notice until the later of (i) the end of the fifth Business
Day after the first such Superior Proposal Notice and (ii) the end of the
third Business Day after all subsequent Superior Proposal Notices), the
Company shall, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to
revise this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or Section 99
of the Securities Act (Ontario) (or equivalent requirements under
the Securities Laws of other Canadian provinces) or (ii) making any
disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, following the receipt
of advice of its outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under the CBCA;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 3.2(b).

3.3 _Company Meeting._ Subject to Section 3.2, the Company will take, in
accordance with applicable Law, its Organizational Documents and the Interim
Order, all action necessary to convene the Company Meeting as promptly as
practicable after it obtains the Interim Order to



 

39  consider and vote upon the approval of the Arrangement Resolution. Subject
to Section 3.2, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend and
not withdraw such recommendation, shall take all lawful action to solicit
such approval, and shall cause the Arrangement Resolution to be submitted to
the Company Common Shareholders at the Company Meeting.

3.4 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification._ (a) The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all

on its part under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement
as soon as practicable (but in no event later than the Termination Date),
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all

to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,

with counsel for the other party as promptly as practicable to develop and
substantiate support for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether from internal or third party sources, in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement; _provided,
however,_ nothing in this Section 3.4 shall require, or be construed to
require, either Parent or the Company to proffer to, or agree to, sell
or hold separate or agree to sell, before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any offer,
sale, holding or agreement to sell, by the Company or Parent of any of its
assets or businesses). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement. Each of Parent and the Company will respond promptly to any

in a form that complies with applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information) and (ii) its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers and
stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may
be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Circular

historical and pro forma financial statements), and any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,  



 

40  the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. The Company shall
provide, and cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to provide, all other information and assistance reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing (including syndication
efforts), including for purposes of any road shows, meetings with,
presentations to (including participation by members of senior management and
representatives of the Company in such meetings and presentations), and
due diligence of, lenders and ratings agencies, including with respect to
obtaining auditors consents and comfort letters, providing access to
auditors work papers, pledging any capital stock or other collateral, and to

could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company or Parent, respectively, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Arrangement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers
or any other Representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat.

3.5 _Access._ Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required
by applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) afford the Representatives of the other party
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts, records and
personnel and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested; _provided, however,_ that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party hereto; _provided, further_ ,
that nothing in this Section 3.5 shall require any party hereto to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
such party would result in (a) the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
such party shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure or (b) any violation of Laws
relating to the sharing of information between competitors, it being
understood that the parties will provide extracts, or summaries, or
aggregations or other information to the greatest extent practicable in a
manner that does not result in any such violation or improper disclosure.

contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement and prior to making any

Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange.

with this Agreement and the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Arrangement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except that fees paid to Governmental Entities in connection with
applicable filings under the HSR Act, the Competition Act and antitrust laws
of other jurisdictions shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

3.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._ (a) Parent shall
cause the Company to honor, and shall itself honor as if it were the Company,
in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by the CBCA or applicable Law,
all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of a director,
officer, employee or agent (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (including rights relating to advancement of expenses and
indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled because they are
serving as a director, officer, agent or employee of another entity at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the Company, any indemnification agreement or
under applicable Laws, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof, and
relating to actions or events through the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall cause the Company to maintain its existing officers and
directors liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of six years
after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the
" _Current Premium_ "); _provided, however,_ that if the existing DandO
Insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year period or
is at an annual premium in excess of 200% of the Current Premium, Parent
shall cause the Company to obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess of 200% (on an
annualized basis) of the Current Premium; _provided_ , _further,_ in lieu of
the foregoing, Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of Parent
containing terms with respect to coverage and amount that are substantially
comparable or (ii) prior to Closing request that the Company obtain extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs.

(c) The provisions of this Section 3.9 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

3.10 _Takeover Statute._ If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation is or may
become applicable to the



 

42  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, each of
Parent, the Company and each of its respective Board of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statue or regulation on such
transactions.

3.11 _Board Matters_. (a) Parent shall take such actions as shall be necessary
to cause the persons listed on Schedule 3.11(a) to be appointed to the Board
of Directors of Parent, effective at the Effective Time, and to serve until
the annual meeting of Parents stockholders to be held in 2007.

(b) Subject to fiduciary duties under applicable Law, Parent shall take such
actions as shall be reasonably necessary to cause one of the persons
listed on Schedule 3.11(a) to be nominated for election to the Board of
Directors of Parent at the annual meeting of Parents stockholders to be held
in 2007 and to comply with Schedule 3.11(b).

(c) Subject to confirmation that insurance coverage is maintained as
contemplated by Section 3.9, the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent
at the Effective Time evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the
Company designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least five calendar
days prior to the Effective Time.

3.12 _Affiliates._ Prior to the date of the Company Meeting, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a list of names and addresses of those Persons who are, in
the opinion of the Company, as of the time of the Company Meeting,
"affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall provide to Parent such information
and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing
such list. There shall be added to such list the names and addresses of any
other Person subsequently identified by either Parent or the Company as a
Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such Person identified by Parent shall be added to the
list of affiliates of the Company if Parent shall receive from the Company, on
or before the date of the Company Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not such an
affiliate. The Company shall exercise reasonable efforts to deliver or cause
to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Closing Date, from each affiliate of
the Company identified in the foregoing list (as the same may be supplemented
as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the Closing Date substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit C hereto (the " _Affiliates Letter_ "). The certificates
representing Parent Common Stock received by such affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement and the Arrangement shall bear a customary legend regarding
applicable Securities Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section
3.12. 

3.13 _Pre-Acquisition Reorganization._ The Company agrees that, upon request
by Parent, which request shall not be made before Parent shall have confirmed
that all conditions in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have been satisfied or waived by
Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the expense
of Parent, use reasonable efforts to (i) effect such reorganizations of its
business, operations and assets immediately before the Effective Time as
Parent may request, acting reasonably (each a " _Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization_ ") and (ii) cooperate with Parent and its advisors
to determine the nature of the Pre-Acquisition



 

43  Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in which they most
effectively be undertaken for the purpose of facilitating a post-
Closing transition and reducing costs. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations shall (A) not delay or prevent
consummation of the Arrangement (including by giving rise to litigation by
third parties) or (B) not be considered in determining whether a
representation or warranty of the Company hereunder has been breached, it
being acknowledged by Parent that these actions could require the consent of
third parties under applicable Contracts. Parent shall provide in writing to
the Company any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization proposed by Parent at
least 21 days prior to the Effective Time. Upon receipt of such proposal,
Parent and the Company shall, at the expense of Parent, work cooperatively and
use reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all
documentation necessary and the Company shall use reasonable efforts and its
own independent judgment to do such other acts and things as are necessary to
give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations immediately before the
Effective Time. The parties shall seek to have any such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization made effective immediately before the Effective Time (but after
Parent shall have confirmed that all conditions in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have
been satisfied or waived by Parent), and in any event, no Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization shall be a condition to completion of the Arrangement.

3.14 _Credit Facilities._ The Company shall cause the outstanding balances
under each credit facility listed on Schedule 3.14 or otherwise required to
be listed on Section 2.1(h)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter to be repaid
prior to Closing, and each such credit facility and all related guarantees,
security agreements and debentures to be terminated, prior to Closing. Parent
and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the replacement of each
outstanding letter of credit and letter of guarantee issued under the credit
facilities prior to Closing.

3.15 _Financing._ In the event that at any time, to Parents knowledge, funds
are not or will not be made available pursuant to the Financing Commitment so
as to enable Parent to consummate the Arrangement, each of Parent and Parent
SubCo shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain alternative funding in an
amount at least equal to the amount necessary to consummate the Arrangement on
terms not materially less favorable to Parent and Parent SubCo than those
provided in the Financing Commitment (" _Alternative Financing_ "). Following
the date hereof, any amendment, modification, termination or cancellation of
the Financing Commitment or the Alternative Financing, as the case may be, or
any information which becomes known to Parent or Parent SubCo where it could
reasonably be expected that the Financing will not be obtained on the terms
set forth in the Financing Commitment or the Alternative Financing, as the
case may be, shall be promptly disclosed to the Company. None of Parent,
Parent SubCo or any of their respective Affiliates will knowingly attempt,
directly or indirectly, to induce or encourage the Lender (or lender of the
Alternative Financing) not to fund any of the Financing provided for in the
Financing Commitment or the Alternative Financing, as the case may be, where
such funding is otherwise permitted thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , the
foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit the taking of any action in
connection with obtaining any Alternative Financing.

3.16 _Benefits Matters._ (a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of one
year immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue employment with Parent, or any of its Subsidiaries, benefits
(other than with respect to equity-based compensation) comparable in value in
the aggregate to the benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to
the



 

44  Closing Date (excluding equity-based compensation) or to benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent, as determined in either case by
Parent in its reasonable discretion. From and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor any Subsidiary shall breach the terms of the Employee Plans
listed on Section 2.1(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, excepting that
regarding the severance guidelines provided in Section 2.1(j)(i), for a
period of one year immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide severance benefits generally consistent with those previously provided
to employees of the Company, and consistent with competitive practice and
regulatory requirements in the relevant geographic location. Where Parent has
a sizeable population in a geographic location, severance benefits shall be at
least comparable in value to those provided to similarly situated employees
of the Parent. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and
the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring,
Parent to continue any specific employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
or to continue the employment of a specific person.

(b) To the extent required by applicable Law or as determined by Parent in
its discretion, Employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries (i) shall
receive credit under the applicable employee benefit plan(s), program(s) or
arrangement(s) established or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
for service required to be accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective
Time with the Company or any Subsidiary (excluding any equity-based
compensation) under Sellers relevant Employee Plans; _provided, however_ ,

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;

this Section 5.2, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set forth

exclude the RS790 if and when either (i) the Company is acquired under the
circumstances set forth on Schedule 5.3(a)(i), (ii) the Company discontinues

develop and sell to customers chipsets that have similar functionality to
Parent Compatible Chipsets and compatibility with Parent Processors, the
definition of Parent Compatible Chipsets may be modified to substitute the
RS790 with another chipset product based upon a "DX-10" graphics core if such
product is compatible with Parent Processors and is generally acceptable in
the market places targeted by the Parent Processors. Company or its successor
shall provide Parent with written notice at least six (6) months in advance of
the initial distribution of the substituted product to a customer.

(b) _Company Supply to Parent_. Upon the occurrence of a Termination
Event, for the duration of the Parent Supply Term, the Company shall sell to
