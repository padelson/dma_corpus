INSPECTION PERIOD; TITLE

 



   2.1 | _Inspection Period_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

Purchaser will have the right to enter upon the Properties and the LodgeWorks
Property to perform, at Purchasers expense, such economic, surveying,
engineering, topographic and marketing tests, studies and investigations,
including environmental studies, as Purchaser may deem appropriate, provided
Purchaser gives Sellers Representative at least one business day notice prior
to entering onto each Property. Upon execution of this Agreement, Sellers
will provide to Purchaser all Phase I and Phase II environmental studies,
engineering, asbestos, soil, fire inspection and ADA reports that Sellers have
previously performed or received with respect to the Properties and the
LodgeWorks Property. In the event that the Purchasers Phase I environmental
study of the Properties raises sufficient issues to necessitate the
performance of Phase II or Phase III studies, Purchaser will have the right
to perform such studies on the relevant Properties. The cost of any new Phase
II or Phase III studies of the Properties will be shared equally by the
affected Seller and the Purchaser. At Purchasers discretion, Purchaser may
also complete additional investigations of the Properties, including UCC,
lien, litigation, judgment and bankruptcy searches. If Purchaser does not
notify Sellers Representative, in writing, prior to the expiration of
the Inspection Period that it elects to continue this Agreement and proceed
to Closing, this Agreement will automatically terminate, and Purchaser will be
released from any and all liability or obligation under this Agreement other
than Purchasers indemnification obligations given pursuant to the following
sentence which will survive termination of this Agreement, and the Deposit
will be immediately refunded to Purchaser. Purchaser will indemnify the
Selling Parties for any loss, damage or liabilities to the extent caused by

2.1(a)_. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Selling Parties have provided Purchaser access to the
following records and information concerning the Properties, the LodgeWorks
Property, and the Third Party Owned Hotels in the Selling Parties possession
or control: (i) all existing architectural and engineering studies; (ii) all
existing title insurance policies; (iii) all existing environmental audits,
studies and reports; (iv) all internal operating statements and audited
financial statements for calendar years 2009 and 2010 (to the extent the
respective Hotel was open during such period); (v) all operating and capital
expenditure budgets for calendar year 2011; (vi) all Existing License
Agreements; (vii) current property improvement plans, if any; (viii) list of
all material permits and licenses; and (ix) list of all material operating and
service contracts (collectively, with all other documents reasonably
requested by Purchaser hereunder, the " _Due Diligence Documents_ "). The
Purchaser will promptly provide the Selling Parties with a complete list that
identifies any additional records and information concerning the Properties,
the LodgeWorks Property, and the Third Party Owned Hotels in the Selling
Parties possession or control that the Purchaser has not been previously
provided. Upon receipt of Purchasers request for additional information, the
Selling Parties will promptly make available to Purchaser, its agents,
auditors, engineers, attorneys, and other designees for inspection copies of
such requested records and information. None of the Selling Parties will
be obligated to create, generate, or order new documents to satisfy
Purchasers requests. For purposes of this Section, the posting of Due
Diligence Documents and any other records and information on the Selling
Parties extranet site and the delivery of the access code therefor,
constitute delivery. Purchaser may, at its sole cost and expense, update and
recertify any of the Surveys (the " _Updated Surveys_ "). Purchaser will have
the right to review the Updated Surveys for a period of not less than ten
(10) days after the Updated Surveys are available and the Inspection Period
will be extended if necessary. The Selling Parties shall, as promptly as
practicable, furnish to the Purchaser such financial and other information
with respect to the Selling Parties that would be required for the Purchaser
to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of Regulation
S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Assets,
including the calculation of the significance conditions referred to in Rule
3-05(b)(2), which the Purchaser may make available to its agents, auditors,
engineers, attorneys, and other designees as set forth in this Section
2.1(b).  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Purchaser (i) at its expense, may cause an examination of title, the Surveys
and Updated Surveys to the Properties to be made, (ii) promptly upon request
provide the Sellers with copies of all title reports, Updated Surveys,
environmental reports, engineering studies and any other third party generated
Property-related due diligence data ordered by Purchaser, and (iii) prior to
the expiration of the Inspection Period, will notify Sellers of any defects
in title and the Surveys or Updated Surveys, as the case may be, shown by such
examination that Purchaser is unwilling to accept. If such defects consist of
mortgages, deeds of trust, 

---|---|--- 
 



3 fixed sum or capable of computation as a fixed sum ("Monetary Defects") or
results from anything done by any Seller after the Inspection Period End Date
without Purchasers consent, Sellers will pay and discharge (in which event,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to pay and discharge at Closing) all such
obligations at or prior to Closing such that all such defects are removed;
provided that if such defects relate to the Leasehold Properties Seller will
only be required to pay and discharge such obligations as they relate to the
leasehold interest. Within ten days after Purchaser so notifies Sellers,
Sellers will notify Purchaser whether Sellers are willing to cure any defects
that are not Monetary Defects. If the Sellers do not elect to cure such
objectionable title and/or survey issues that are not Monetary Defects for any
of the Properties transferred at the Primary Closing, Purchaser may terminate
this Agreement. If Sellers do not elect to cure such objectionable title
and/or survey issues that are not Monetary Defects for any of the Properties
transferred at any Closing after the Primary Closing, the Purchaser may
refuse to purchase such Properties, but may not terminate this Agreement. All
title and survey exceptions other than those that are to be paid or cured as
provided above, those first disclosed by the Title Company after the date of
Purchasers title examination for a Property, and those objected to by
Purchaser prior to the Inspection Period End Date will be deemed Permitted
Title Exceptions. Further, any title exception which is waived by Purchaser
will be a Permitted Title Exception. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | During the Inspection Period, upon notice to Purchaser, the
Selling Parties may update any of their respective Disclosure Schedules and
the Development Pipeline information in _Exhibit D_ ; provided that Selling
Parties deliver such updates and any related underlying documents to Purchaser
during the Inspection Period; provided further, Purchaser will have not less
than ten days to review such documents before the Inspection Period End Date.
Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, the Selling Parties and
Purchaser will agree to the final forms of the Appendices, Exhibits and
Schedules as the same may be amended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | All exhibits, schedules, agreements, certificates, the
LodgeWorks Lease with SA L.P. and other documents required to be delivered
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement for which a form is not attached
hereto will be reasonably satisfactory in form, scope and substance to
Purchaser and the Selling Parties on or before ten days prior to the
expiration of the Inspection Period. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.2 | _Conveyance of Title_. At Closing, Sellers will convey and
transfer to Purchaser good and marketable fee simple title to the Real
Property (other than the Leasehold Properties) and good and marketable
leasehold title to the Leasehold Properties. Evidence of delivery of such
marketable title will be the issuance to Purchaser or its designee at Closing
of ALTA owners policies and leasehold policies of title insurance covering
all of the Real Property in the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price
allocated to the Properties subject only to the Permitted Title Exceptions in
the forms reasonably required by Purchaser (collectively, the " _Title

---|---

---|---|---

liquor license from the Closing Date until the earlier of (a) Purchasers
receipt of a replacement liquor license (which Purchaser agrees to make
diligent efforts to procure), or (b) six months after the Closing Date, except
that this six month period will be extended for an additional reasonable

be obtained within the six month period.

its affiliate) deems appropriate consistent with Purchasers standard policies
and practices, but all Rehired Employees will receive service credit with
Purchaser dating back to their original hire date as set forth in LodgeWorks
records and will receive a credit with Purchaser for all paid time off that
they have accrued with LodgeWorks and not taken as of Closing for which

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | The applicable Selling Party will transfer to Purchaser (or
its designee) all of such Selling Partys interest in all Existing License
Agreements between a Selling Party and Purchaser (or an affiliate of

   11.19 | _Alternative Dispute Resolution_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Generally_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

All disputes between the Selling Parties and Purchaser regarding the rights,
duties or obligations of such parties under this Agreement (an "Arbitration
Dispute") shall be resolved by binding arbitration held in Wilmington,
Delaware. The arbitration shall constitute the exclusive means for the
resolution of any such controversy, dispute or claim,  

---|---|--- 
 



23 subject to these arbitration provisions and to jurisdiction of the arbitrator.
The Parties waive their rights to commence any legal proceedings against each
other to enforce these arbitration provisions or confirm or contest the
arbitrators award in any court or jurisdiction other than the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware sitting in Wilmington, Delaware
(the "Court"). Pending appointment of the arbitrator as provided herein, the
Court is empowered to issue temporary relief and/or provisional remedies. The
Parties may not commence any lawsuit with respect to any Arbitration Dispute
except as expressly permitted by this Section. 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | An arbitration may be commenced by either party notifying
the other party that an Arbitration Dispute must be resolved by the
arbitration procedure described herein. The date of delivery of such notice
shall be referred to herein as "Notice Date". The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, as amended by the terms of this Section. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Appointment of Arbitrator_. The arbitration shall be
conducted by a single arbitrator, who shall be a recognized expert in the
hospitality industry, which individual shall be a licensed attorney and shall
have at least 10 years experience representing clients in connection with the
acquisition, development and/or owning of hotel properties, who does not have
a conflict of interest with any party, and who shall be agreed upon by the
parties hereto within 25 days after the Notice Date. If the parties are unable
to agree upon such an arbitrator, then the arbitration will be administered by
the American Arbitration Association and an arbitrator with the same
qualifications will be selected under the Associations procedure. The
arbitrator will be asked to set the matter for hearing within 90 days after
the appointment of the arbitrator and try any and all issues and to render a
decision upon them. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 11.19, the
arbitrator shall determine the manner in which the arbitration hearing is
conducted, including the timing and presentation of evidence and argument, and
all other questions that may arise with respect to the arbitration
proceedings. The costs of the arbitration initially shall be borne equally by
the parties, subject to any reallocation of such costs by the arbitrator in
connection with subparagraph (g) below.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

_Discovery/Procedures_. After the appointment of the arbitrator, the parties
shall have the right to take depositions and to obtain discovery consistent
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by other means regarding the subject
matter of the arbitration as if the matter were pending in the U.S. District
Court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitrator may, for good cause
shown, limit the nature and extent of such discovery and establish or modify
the schedule relating to any discovery requests or applications relating
thereto. The arbitrator shall have the power to decide all other procedural
issues, including the following: the date, time and place of any hearing; the
form, timing, and subject matter of any pre-hearing documents to be submitted
by the parties; and any evidentiary or 

---|---|--- 
 



24 arbitration hearing. All discovery conducted in connection with an Arbitration
Dispute shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in
Section 11.17. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | _Manner of Arbitration Hearing_. At least five days prior
to the arbitrators hearing as to any dispute to be resolved under Section
11.19, all Parties shall submit to the arbitrator a written brief explaining
their position on the applicable Arbitration Dispute. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | _Relief; Binding_. The arbitrator shall, within 30 days
after closing the hearing record, issue an award disposing of all of the
controversies, disputes and claims of the parties that are the subject of the
arbitration. The arbitrator shall issue his decision to both parties through
their respective counsel or representatives. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 11.19 and its subparagraphs, any award rendered by the
arbitrator shall be final, and judgment may be entered by the Court under the
provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 _et se_ q. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby expressly waives
any and all rights to a jury trial in any action or proceeding referenced in
this Section 11.19.  
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | _Arbitrator s and Attorneys Fees_. The arbitrator shall
have the discretion to award attorneys fees and costs and the arbitrator fees
and costs incurred in such arbitration or proceeding to the prevailing party,
but shall have no obligation or be under any requirement to do so. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | _Confidentiality_. Purchaser, the Selling Parties and their
representatives, including any professionals representing Purchaser and
Sellers, LodgeWorks, and Franchisor, will keep all information disclosed in
the arbitration, all the controversies, disputes and claims of the parties
that are the subject of the arbitration, and all of the results and findings
of the arbitration confidential, except to the extent disclosure is compelled
by law, and then only to the extent of such compulsion. 
---|---|--- 



   11.20 | _1031 Exchange_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Purchaser will, upon request of any Seller, cooperate in
effecting one or more tax-deferred like kind exchanges under Internal Revenue
Code Section 1031 (an "Exchange") in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Sellers each acknowledge that Purchaser is acquiring some or
all of the Assets in a transaction intended by Purchaser to qualify as an
Exchange.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

In connection with any Exchange, the party for whose benefit the exchange is
being made (the " _Disposing Party_ ") will assign this Agreement or portions
thereof to one or more qualified intermediaries (" _QIs_ ") to complete the
Exchange(s). All parties agree that, at the applicable Closing, they will, if
required, sign a form acknowledging their consent to the assignment of this
Agreement or portions thereof to the appropriate QIs. The other parties to the
Exchange (the " _Acquiring_ 

---|---|--- 
 



25 Disposing Party to effect such Exchange(s), provided that the Acquiring
Parties incur no additional expense or liability, and further provided that,
after the applicable Closing, all parties shall remain liable for all their
respective covenants, representations, and warranties that will survive the
applicable Closing, despite the assignment of the Agreement to
the appropriate QIs. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | Purchaser and the appropriate Sellers grant to all limited
partners of the Sellers, and the Selling Parties (acting for and on behalf of
the limited partners of the Sellers) the option to acquire the Option Hotels
by a cash purchase or by tender of like kind property in a like kind exchange,
either before or after the scheduled Closing of the specific Hotel, (but not
later than 180 days thereafter) all of the then owners right, title, and
interest in and to (whether the Purchaser after the applicable Closing or
appropriate Seller) the Hotel identified as Sierra Suites King of Prussia,
Sierra Suites Merrifield, Sierra Suites Bellevue, and/or Sierra Suites
Redmond (the "Option Hotels") for the Purchase Price per Hotel set forth on
Exhibit C on the same general terms and conditions as provided herein. In
order to have an effective Exchange, the structure of such transaction may
require the distribution and exchange of undivided interests in the
Properties, temporary title thereto in a QI or a limited partner, and other
steps necessary to satisfy tax requirements; and Purchaser and the Selling
Parties agree to cooperate in completing these steps. 
---|---|--- 



   11.21 | _Brokers/Intermediaries_. Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Selling Parties from and against any loss, liability,
damage, cost, claim or expense incurred by reason of any claim for a
brokerage or finders fee or commission payable or alleged to be payable to
any other broker, finder or other intermediary, based on any agreement or act
of Purchaser. The Selling Parties hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser from and against any loss, liability, damage, cost, claim or expense
incurred by reason of any claim for a brokerage or finders fee or commission
payable or alleged to be payable to any broker, finder or other intermediary,
based on any agreement or act of the Selling Parties. The provisions of this
paragraph will survive the Closing.

Period. 
---|--- 



   10.2 | _The Selling Parties  Indemnification_. Subject to _Section

successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ")
harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified
Parties the amount of, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, obligations,
deficiencies, demands, judgments, damages (including incidental and
consequential damages), interest, fines, claims, suits, actions, causes of
action, assessments, costs and expenses (including costs of investigation and
defense and attorneys and other professionals fees), or any diminution in
value, whether or not involving a third party claim (individually, a " _Loss_
" and, collectively, " _Losses_ "): 
---|--- 



     | (a) | based upon, attributable to, or resulting from, the failure
of any of the representations or warranties made by any Seller to be true and
complete as of the date hereof; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | based upon, attributable to, or resulting from, the breach
of any covenant or other agreement on the part of any Seller, LodgeWorks or
Franchisor under this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



   10.3 | _Indemnification Limitations_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Selling Parties will have no obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser until the Loss from all such claims exceeds a $250,000 deductible,
determined on a per Property basis. LodgeWorks will have no obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser until the Loss from all LodgeWorks related claims
exceeds $250,000 deductible. Franchisor will have no obligation to indemnify
the Purchaser until the Loss from all such claims exceeds $250,000
deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims against LodgeWorks, as

deductible, and no Property will be eligible for more than one
$250,000 deductible. The liability of the Selling Parties, collectively, to
indemnify the Purchaser will not exceed the Holdback Escrow Amount. The
Holdback Escrow Amount is Purchasers exclusive remedy for any indemnity
claim. 
---|---|--- 
  



86 the Selling Parties for a breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained herein, but excluding the indemnification under Section 2.1 and the
liquidated damages in Section 11.3(b), may not exceed the Purchaser Liability
Cap. 
---|---|--- 



   10.4 | _Indemnification Procedures_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third party claim may be asserted by notice to the party or parties from whom
indemnification is sought and the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement and _Section 11.19_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | In the event of a legal proceeding or that any claim or
demand is asserted by any third party in respect of which payment may be
sought under _Section 10.2_ hereof (" _Indemnification Claim_ "), the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable
(hereinafter, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") will promptly cause written notice
of the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which
is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Indemnifying Party or
representative thereof (hereinafter, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") and, if the
claim is against the Selling Parties, the Escrow Agent. The failure of the
Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Indemnification
Claim will not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.
The Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against by it hereunder. Provided however, that all
Purchaser Indemnification Claims will be paid exclusively from the Holdback
Escrow Amount and paid pursuant to the claims procedure set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, it will within five days (or
sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the
Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it
hereunder, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election as herein
provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for
such Losses under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the
Indemnified Party defends any Indemnification Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for the expenses of defending such
Indemnification Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the Indemnifying
Party will assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified
Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such 

---|---|--- 
 



87 Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested
by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable; and provided, further, that the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(plus any appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection
with any Indemnification Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the Selling
Parties costs of defense will not be paid from the Holdback Escrow Amount. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | The Parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
Indemnification Claim involving a third party. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Appendix 10.4_ to the contrary, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the
Indemnified Party will, without the written consent of the other party, settle
or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such other
party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the
Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on
any Indemnification Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to
any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Indemnification Claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | After any final decision, judgment or award will have been
rendered by and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a
