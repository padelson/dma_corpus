Section 2.4 Closing Estimates.

Closing Statement") signed by an officer of the Company attaching:

(i)a statement setting forth the estimated amount of Closing Non-Cash Working
Capital as of the Determination Time (the "Estimated Non-Cash Working
Capital");

(ii)a statement setting forth the estimated amount of Indebtedness as of the
Determination Time (the "Estimated Indebtedness"), together with payment
instructions related thereto;

(iii)a statement setting forth the estimated amount of the Cash as of the
Determination Time (the "Estimated Cash");

(iv)a statement setting forth the estimated amount of Transaction Expenses as
of the Determination Time (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"), along with
final invoices from the relevant payees; and (v)on the basis of the foregoing estimates, a calculation of the Estimated
Closing Purchase Price.

(b)Seller shall prepare the foregoing estimates in good faith with reasonable
detail and shall provide Parent with reasonable access to personnel,
properties, Books and Records of the Company and to any other information used
or prepared by the Company in connection with the determination of such
estimates reasonably requested by Purchaser for purposes of reviewing the
calculations required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.4. Estimated
Cash, Estimated Non-Cash Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated
Transaction Expenses shall be calculated in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles.

(c)Parent shall be entitled to review the Estimated Closing Statement prior to
the Closing and to submit comments thereon to the Company, and the Company
shall consider in good faith any such comments and may (but is not required
to) revise the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the Closing to reflect
such comments. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be in the form initially
presented to Parent pursuant to this Section 2.4 unless the Company determines
to accept one or more comments from Parent, in which case the Estimated
Closing Statement submitted by the Company and as revised by the Company to
reflect Parent comments, shall be the Estimated Closing Statement for purposes
of Closing. No comments delivered by Parent, or Parent's failure to deliver
any comments, shall be deemed to constitute any waiver or release of any of
Parent's rights under this Agreement.

Section 2.5 Estimated Closing Purchase Price; Closing Payments. At the
Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Holdco, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to
pay to Holdco, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing in advance of Closing, in exchange for the
Interests, an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price.

Section 2.6 Post-Closing Adjustment to Closing Purchase Price.

(a)Parent shall cause the Company to prepare and, as soon as practical, but in
no event later than 90 days after the Closing Date, to deliver to Seller, a
statement setting forth Parent's and the Company's calculation of (i) the
Closing Non-Cash Working Capital (including each component item thereof as set
forth in the Sample Statement), expressed as a positive or negative number,
(ii) the Closing Cash, (iii) the Closing Indebtedness and (iv) the Closing
Transaction Expenses (collectively, the "Initial Calculations"), and based on
the foregoing, the Closing Purchase Price. Closing Non-Cash Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses shall be
calculated in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles.

(b)Within 45 days after receipt by Seller of the Initial Calculations, Seller
may deliver to Parent a written notice (the "Calculation Notice") either (i)
advising Parent that Seller agrees with and accepts the Initial Calculations
or (ii) setting forth an explanation in reasonable detail of those items in
the Initial Calculations that Seller disputes and of what Seller believes is
the correct calculation of Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Purchase
Price. If Seller does not submit a Calculation Notice within the 45-day period
provided herein, then the Initial Calculations shall become final and shall
not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment. Any Calculation
Notice may reference only disagreements based on mathematical errors or based
on amounts of the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or
Closing Transaction Expenses as reflected on the Initial Calculations not
being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.5. If Parent concurs with
the Calculation Notice, or if Parent does not object to the Calculation Notice
in a writing received by Seller within 45 days after Parent's receipt of the
Calculation Notice, the calculation of the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth
in the Calculation Notice shall become final and shall not be subject to
further review, challenge or adjustment.

(c)If Seller has submitted a Calculation Notice and Seller and Parent are
unable to resolve all disputes regarding the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth
therein within 30 days after the date of Seller's objection to the submission
of the Calculation Notice, then (i) all calculations of Closing Non-Cash
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction
Expenses not specifically disputed shall be final and binding on the Parties
and (ii) only the unresolved disputes shall be referred to BDO USA, LLP or, if
such firm shall decline to serve, such other nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants selected by mutual agreement of
Parent and Seller (the "Settlement Accountants") acting as an expert and not
an arbitrator, and the determination of the Settlement Accountants regarding
the unresolved disputes shall be final and shall not be subject to further
review, challenge or adjustment, absent manifest error. The Settlement
Accountants shall consider only such items as are in the unresolved dispute,
shall determine the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses in accordance with the standards
described in this Section 2.6 and shall be instructed by Parent and Seller to
use their best efforts to reach such determination not more than 30 days after
such referral. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize or permit the
Settlement Accountants to resolve any item in dispute by making an adjustment
to the Initial Calculations that is outside of the range for such item defined
by the Initial Calculations and the Calculation Notice. Seller and Parent
shall each pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Section 2.6; provided, however, that the fees and expenses of the Settlement
Accountants shall be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, in inverse proportion to the aggregate dollar value of the item(s)
subject to the dispute determined in favor of such Party.

(d)If (i) the sum of the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital and the Closing Cash
less (ii) the sum of Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses, in
each case as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.6, is higher
or lower than (A) the sum of the Estimated Non-Cash Working Capital and
Estimated Cash less (B) the sum of the Estimated Indebtedness and the
Estimated Transaction Expenses, then Purchaser or Seller (on behalf of
Holdco), as the case may be, shall pay to the other, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five Business Days after the date on which
the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Transaction Expenses are final and binding on the Parties in
accordance with this Section 2.6 to an account designated in writing by the
receiving Party, an amount, if any, that puts each of Purchaser and Seller in
the position each would have been in if the Estimated Closing Purchase Price,
and the payment pursuant to Section 2.5 on account of the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price, had been computed using the Closing Non-Cash Working Capital,
the Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness, as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.6, in lieu of the Estimated Non-Cash Working
Capital, the Estimated Cash, the Estimated Indebtedness and the Estimated
Transaction Expenses. In the case of any payment made by or to Seller under this Section 2.6(d), such payment shall be treated as having been
made by or to Holdco and on behalf of Holdco.

(e)For Tax purposes, amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be deemed
an adjustment to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price.

(f)In connection with this Section 2.6, each Party shall be entitled to review
the working papers, trial balances and similar materials of the others for
purposes of reviewing any calculations provided hereunder. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide Seller and the
accountants engaged by Seller with timely and reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the Company's personnel, properties, books and records, in
each case at the expense of the Company, provided that nothing in this Section
2.6(f) shall require the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to disclose any information to Seller that (i) would violate the
maintenance of attorney‑client or other legal privileges or doctrines or (ii)
would violate applicable Regulations or limitations imposed by any
Governmental Body.

(g)Amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.6(d) shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by The Wall Street Journal as
its prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number
of days elapsed. Payments in respect of Section 2.6(d) shall be made within
five Business Days of final determination of the Closing Purchase Price (and
any adjustment thereto) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.6 by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated in writing by the Party entitled to such payment at least two
Business Days prior to such payment date.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company and Purchaser shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent and Seller
reasonably agree are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of applicable Regulations. If the
Company or Purchaser so withholds any such amounts and pays such amounts over
to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect of which the Company, Parent, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.8 Confirmation of Certain Payment Responsibilities. In the event
that the Company is not the sole obligor of any item that is included in
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses or Current Liabilities,
then the Company shall, by virtue of such inclusion, be deemed to be the sole
obligor of such item, and the Company shall be deemed to have assumed at the
Closing the primary obligation to pay such item and shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Seller Party and its Affiliates against and on account
of any and all such items.

breach, default or acceleration would or would reasonably be expected to
challenge or prevent the Transaction or materially hinder, modify or delay the
Transaction or would or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither of the Seller Parties is required to file,
seek or obtain any notice, authorization, approval, order, permit or consent
of or with any Governmental Body in connection with the execution, delivery or

REPRESENATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to Seller
in connection with this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company and the Seller Parties as of
the Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date as follows:

Section 5.1. Due Organization; Due Formation; Good Standing; Power and
Authority. Parent is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas and has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Purchaser is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.

Section 5.2. Authority and Enforceability. Each of Parent and Purchaser has
the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, to consummate the Transaction
and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution,
delivery and performance by each of Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and
the other Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by
each of Parent and Purchaser of the Transaction, have been duly authorized by
all necessary action of each of Parent and Purchaser, as applicable. This
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which Parent or Purchaser is
a party has been, or will be when executed and delivered on the Closing Date,
duly executed and delivered by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, and,
assuming due execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, constitutes
(or will constitute) a valid and legally binding obligation of Parent or
Purchaser, as applicable, enforceable against it in accordance with the terms
hereof, except as enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

Section 5.3. No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by each
of Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which
it is a party, as applicable, and the consummation of the Transaction do not
and will not (i) result in or constitute a default, breach or other violation,
or an event that, with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default, breach or other violation, of the
Organizational Documents of each of Parent and Purchaser; and (ii) with or
without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, (A) violate or
require any consent, approval, filing or notice under, any Regulation
applicable to Parent or Purchaser or permits to be obtained by Parent or
Purchaser or (B) violate or result in the breach of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the acceleration of the performance of any obligations of
Parent or Purchaser.

Section 5.4. No Actions. There is no Action (other than Actions that may
hereafter be brought by any of the Parties to this Agreement) pending or, to
the knowledge of each of Parent and Purchaser, threatened in writing against
Parent or Purchaser which seeks to prevent hinder, modify, delay or challenge
the Transaction.

Section 5.5. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transaction based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
Purchaser.

Section 5.6. Financing. Purchaser has delivered to Seller and the Company a
true and complete copy of an executed debt commitment letter from Suntrust
Bank, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Compass Bank d/b/a BBVA Compass, U.S.
Bank National Association, Zions Bancorporation, N.A. (dba Amegy Bank) (as the
same may be amended pursuant to Section 6.14, the "Debt Financing
Commitment"), pursuant to which the lender parties thereto have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be
provided the debt amounts set forth therein (the "Debt Financing"). As of the
date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment has not been amended or
modified, and is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Purchaser and Parent and, to the knowledge of
Purchaser and Parent, the other parties thereto (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). There are no
conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing
other than as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred that (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach or default on the part of Parent or Purchaser under the Debt Financing
Commitment or, to the knowledge or Parent and Purchaser, any other parties
thereto. Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, has fully paid all
commitment fees and other fees required by the terms of the Debt Financing
Commitment to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement and Parent and
Purchaser do not have knowledge of any fact or occurrence existing on the date
hereof that would make or reasonably be expected to make any of the
assumptions reflected in, or any of the statements set forth in, the Debt
Financing Commitment materially inaccurate or that would cause or reasonably
be expected to cause the Debt Financing Commitment to be ineffective. As of
the Agreement Date, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount
of the Debt Financing will not be available to Purchaser on the Closing Date,
subject to completion of the Marketing Period and the performance by the
Seller and the Company of their obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing Commitment and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article 7, the aggregate proceeds
to be provided to Purchaser pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment,
together with other financial resources of Parent and Purchaser, will be
sufficient for Purchaser to consummate the Transaction upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses.

Section 5.7. No Other Representations or Warranties; Acknowledgments.

(a)Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or any other Ancillary Document,
neither the Company, Seller, nor any of their respective agents, Affiliates,
representatives, nor any other Person, makes or shall be deemed to make any
representation or warranty to Parent or Purchaser or any other Person, express
or implied, at law or in equity, on behalf of the Company or the Seller
Parties, as applicable, and Parent and Purchaser hereby disclaim any such
representation or warranty, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to
Parent and Purchaser or any of their officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives or any other Person of any documentation or other information
by the Company, the Seller Parties or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents or representatives or any other Person with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

(b)None of the Company, the Seller Parties, their respective Affiliates or any
other Person acting on behalf of any of them will have or be subject to any
Liability to Parent, Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Parent or Purchaser, for their use, of any information, and
any information, document or material made available to Purchaser, whether or
not included in certain "data rooms," (whether electronic or otherwise),
management presentations or any other form in expectation of the Transaction.
In connection with Parent's and Purchaser's investigation of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser have received certain projections and business plan
information. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that Parent and Purchaser are familiar with such
uncertainties and that Parent and Purchaser are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to them, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts. Accordingly, the Seller Parties and the Company make no
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumption underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit Purchaser's remedies
for claims involving Fraud.

Section 6.2. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a)From the Agreement Date through the Closing, the Company and the Seller
Parties will provide Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice to the Company's or the Seller
Parties' Representatives, with reasonable access during normal business hours
to the Leased Real Property and assets of the Company and its personnel,
representatives and Books and Records; provided, that such access will be
subject to the terms of any applicable Real Property Lease and will otherwise
give due regard to minimizing interference with the operations, activities and
employees of the Company. In addition, neither Parent, Purchaser nor any of
their respective authorized representatives shall contact or hold discussions
with customers, suppliers, agents or employees of the Business without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, withheld or conditioned).

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date, the Seller
Parties shall give Purchaser access to the Real Property Leases in the
possession of the Seller Parties or the Company. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing, the Seller Parties shall deliver to Purchaser
all original (and any and all copies of) agreements, documents, Books and
Records, files and other information, and all computer disks, records, tapes
and any other storage medium on which any such agreements, documents, books
and records, files and other information are stored, in any such case relating
primarily to the Business that are in the possession of the Seller Parties.
Following the Closing, the Seller Parties shall not retain in their possession
or control, in any form, any agreements, documents, Books and Records, files
or other information, or any computer disks, records, tapes or any other
storage medium that contains any agreements, documents, Books and Records,
files and other information, relating primarily to the Business (including any
personal or other information stored on any Company media by any employees of
the Company); provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to agreements,
documents, Books and Records, files and other information that are: (i)
contained in any electronic file created pursuant to a Seller Party's routine
back-up or archiving procedure, (ii) required by either Seller Party or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the provision of services to the Company
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreements or (iii) required by a Seller
Party for compliance with Regulations; and provided further that, if and so
long as, any such information is Confidential Information then such
Confidential Information shall be kept confidential in accordance with Section 6.2(e). If,
notwithstanding the foregoing, a Seller Party discovers following the Closing
Date that it is in possession of or has under its control any such items that
it is not permitted to retain pursuant to the foregoing or the following
sentence, then such Seller Party shall thereafter permanently delete and erase
all such information (including all copies thereof) in its possession or under
its control as soon as reasonably practicable. In the event that any Books and
Records or other information to be delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 6.2(b) relate not only to the Company but to either Seller Party or
other Affiliates of Seller or are necessary for Seller or any of its
Affiliates to comply with Regulations or to comply with Contracts, then Seller
shall be entitled to retain copies of such Books and Records or other
information to the extent necessary for such compliance.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Section 6.2 shall require the Seller Parties, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to disclose any information to Purchaser if such
disclosure (i) would violate the maintenance of attorney‑client or other legal
privileges or doctrines, or (ii) would violate applicable Regulations or
limitations imposed by any Governmental Body.

(d)Each of Parent and Purchaser will hold and will cause its representatives
and Affiliates to hold in confidence all documents and information furnished
to it in connection with the Transaction pursuant to the terms of that certain
confidentiality agreement dated July 26, 2018 between Seller and Parent (the
"Non-Disclosure Agreement"). All materials reviewed or received in connection
with this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to be Evaluation Material (as defined in
the Non-Disclosure Agreement) for the purposes of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall
expire and no longer apply to Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates.

(e)For a period of three years following the Closing Date, each Seller Party
shall not, and each Seller Party shall direct its Representatives not to, use
for its or their own commercial benefit or divulge or convey to any third
party for such third party's commercial benefit, any Confidential Information;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing restriction, Seller or
its Representatives may furnish such portion (and only such portion) of the
Confidential Information as such Seller Party or such Representative
reasonably determines it is legally obligated to disclose if: (i) it receives
a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under
the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a
Governmental Body; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request, it
notifies Purchaser of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such
request and consults with Purchaser on the advisability of taking steps
available under applicable Regulations to resist or narrow such request; and
(iii) it exercises reasonable best efforts to obtain an order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the
disclosed Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Confidential Information" consists of non-public information and data
relating to the Company or this Transaction other than information that is or
becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this
Section 6.2(e) by a Seller Party or its Representatives, but in no event shall
information exclusively relating to or exclusively used in the operation of
the Simply Mac Business be Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, each Seller Party or its Representatives
may (without notice to Parent or Purchaser), furnish Confidential Information
to one or more Persons who execute a customary confidentiality agreement in
connection with any negotiations or discussions involving any Seller CIC
Transaction; provided, that the Seller Parties shall be jointly and severally liable for any breaches
of any such confidentiality agreements by the counterparties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2, this Section 6.2 is subject to
Section 11.7.

Section 6.3. Exclusivity. Each Seller Party and the Company agree that between
the Agreement Date and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, such Seller Party and the Company shall not, and each shall take
all action necessary to ensure that their respective Affiliates and
Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly,

(a)solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the capital stock or other equity or
ownership interest of the Company or assets of the Company, other than
inventory to be sold in the Ordinary Course, (ii) to enter into any merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving all or any portion of
the capital stock or other equity or ownership interest of the Company or
assets of the Company or (iii) to enter into a recapitalization,
reorganization or any other extraordinary business transaction involving all
or any portion of the capital stock or other equity or ownership interest of
the Company or assets of the Company (the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), a "Company Sale Transaction") (for the avoidance of doubt, a Company
Sale Transaction shall exclude a Seller CIC Transaction and the
Reorganization); or

(b)participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the foregoing. Each Seller Party and the Company immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations,
negotiations and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to a Company Sale Transaction.

Seller and/or the Company shall notify Purchaser promptly, but in any event
within 24 hours, orally and in writing if any such proposal or offer, or any
inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect to a Company Sale
Transaction, is made. Any such notice to Purchaser shall indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact. Each Seller Party and the Company shall not release
any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which such Seller Party or the Company is a party relating to a
Company Sale Transaction, without the prior written consent of Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.3 or any other
provision in this Agreement shall prohibit or limit a Seller Party from
soliciting, initiating, considering, encouraging or accepting any other
proposals or offers or participating in any discussions, conversations,
negotiations or other communications regarding a Seller CIC Transaction with
any third-party (and from consummating any such Seller CIC Transaction)
provided that any such Seller CIC Transaction does not prevent, prohibit,
challenge or materially hinder or delay the consummation of the Transaction. Section 6.4. Regulatory Filings and Clearances.

(a)Each of Parent, the Seller Parties and the Company agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to make required filings with respect to the Transaction pursuant
to the HSR Act, including a Notification and Report Form. The foregoing filing
shall be made as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than five
Business Days after, the Agreement Date. Each of the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as practicable, and within the
time frame required by applicable Regulations or any extension of time
requested thereunder, any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, including
but not limited to substantial compliance with any request for additional
information or documentary materials issued under 16 CFR §803.20, compliance
with any properly issued civil investigative demands and interrogatories.

(b)In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.4(a), each of the
Parties shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Regulations, (i)
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the other Parties in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the
other Parties informed of any material communication received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding the Transaction and (iii) permit the
other Parties, to the extent practicable, through their legal advisors, to (A)
review any material communication given by them to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC or the DOJ, or (B)
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, consult with each other
in advance of any meeting or conference with such private party.

(c)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall not be required to take or
agree to undertake any action, including entering into any consent decree,
hold separate order or other arrangement, that would (A) require the
divestiture of any assets of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, (B) limit Parent or Purchaser's freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, the Company or any of
its assets or businesses or any of Parent's, Purchaser's or their respective
Affiliates' other assets or businesses or (C) limit Parent's or Purchaser's
ability to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect
to, the Interests, in each case to the extent such actions would reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the value of the Company or Parent
and its Subsidiaries (each such action, a "Burdensome Action").

Section 6.5. Third Party Approvals and Consents. Each Seller Party and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Seller
Consents; provided, that Purchaser and Parent shall have no obligation to give
any guarantee or other consideration of any nature in connections with any
Required Seller Consents. Section 6.6. Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and Section 6.4 and Section 6.5, each of the Parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or
cause to be done all things reasonably necessary under applicable Regulations
to consummate and effect the Transaction, including (a) contesting any legal
proceeding seeking to prevent the Transaction and (b) executing any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transaction, in each case to the
extent taking such actions would not constitute Burdensome Actions. If at any
time after the Closing any further action is reasonably necessary to
consummate or make effective the Transaction, the proper officers and
directors of each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all such necessary action. In the event that a Seller Party or a
Subsidiary of Seller (other than the Company) has any obligations pursuant to
any Real Property Lease or related document that has not been terminated prior
to the Closing, then Parent and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such termination in connection with any renewal or
modification of any such Real Property Lease, provided that neither Parent nor
Purchaser shall be obligated to give any guarantee or other consideration of
any nature in connection with any such renewal or modification.

Section 6.7. Indemnification; Insurance. Seller shall maintain in effect for
six (6) years after the Closing, insurance "tail" or other insurance policies
with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance on comparable
terms as, and covering those Persons who are currently covered by, the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance at least to the
same extent as such directors and officers are currently covered. Every Person
who is a director or officer of the Company immediately prior to the Closing
who is named as an insured party on a policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance shall continue to be so named for such six (6) year period
following the Closing.

Section 6.8. Employee Benefits.

(a)Parent will cause the Company to continue to provide, and will not
interfere with or prevent the Company from providing, to all active employees
of the Company as of the Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Transferred Employees) who remain employed by the Company following the
Closing (collectively, the "Affected Employees"), for the period beginning at
the Closing and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing (the
"Continuation Period"), base compensation, annual bonus compensation
opportunities, tax-qualified retirement benefits, and welfare benefits which
are no less favorable in the aggregate as those provided to such Affected
Employees immediately prior to the Closing (including in particular, severance
benefits no less favorable than those contemplated by the Company's existing
severance practices, as summarized in Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule); provided, that, benefits shall be no less favorable than those
granted to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the Company to
continue any specific employee benefit plan or to continue the employment of
any specific Person for any specific period of time following the Closing.

(b)Parent will, during the Continuation Period, cause the Company to honor,
and will not interfere with or prevent the Company from honoring, all unused
vacation, holiday, paid time off, sickness and personal days accrued by the
employees of the Company under the policies and practices of the Company. In
the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to any Affected
Employee during the Continuation Period, Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under such plan, except to
the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under the Company's then-existing plans absent any change in such welfare plan
coverage and (ii) provide each Affected Employee and their eligible dependents
with credit for any co‑payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change
in coverage in satisfying any applicable deductible or out‑of‑pocket
requirements under such new or changed plan. Parent will cause the Company to
provide, and will not interfere with or prevent the Company from providing,
each Affected Employee with credit for all service with the Company and its
ERISA Affiliates under each employee benefit plan, policy, program or
arrangement in which such Affected Employee is eligible to participate to the
same extent provided under the corresponding Benefit Plan, except for any plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or any plan, program or policy providing retiree
health or life benefits, or except to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of services. The
service of Transferred Employees with Seller will be deemed to include service
with the Company for purposes of this Section 6.8(b).

(c)For purposes of unvested cash- and stock-based long-term incentive awards
held by Affected Employees immediately prior to Closing (including any accrued
but unvested dividends associated with such stock-based long-term incentive
awards) (collectively, the "Affected Awards"), Seller will allow the portions
of those awards that are otherwise scheduled to vest on or prior to March 3,
2019 (the "Applicable Tranches") to remain outstanding following the Closing
and will continue to treat the Company as an affiliate of the Seller through
March 3, 2019 solely for purposes of determining whether the service-based
vesting conditions of the Applicable Tranches are satisfied. In addition, if
an Affected Employee becomes entitled to severance benefits in accordance with
Section 6.8(a) prior to the scheduled vesting date of such Affected Employee's
Applicable Tranche, such Applicable Tranche will vest and become payable as of
the date of such severance event; and Seller retains the right, in its
discretion, to settle any stock-based Applicable Tranche in cash based on the
closing price of Seller common stock on the vesting date of the Applicable
Tranche. As a condition of the continued and/or accelerated vesting described
in this paragraph and settlement thereof, each Affected Employee may be
required by Seller to execute a release of claims against the Seller, the
Company and their affiliates in such form as Seller may prescribe. Seller and
the Company agree to cooperate and exchange such information as may be
reasonably necessary to confirm any Affected Employee's entitlement to the
vesting of an Applicable Tranche. For avoidance of doubt, Seller (and not the
Company) will be entitled to claim any tax deduction arising with respect to
the vesting and/or payment of the Applicable Tranches. All portions of the
Affected Awards other than the Applicable Tranches will be forfeited without
consideration as of the Closing and Seller will have no liability to any party
in respect thereof.

(d)Nothing contained in this Section 6.8, express or implied, shall (i) create
any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee
of the Company (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), or (ii) be
deemed to amend any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program or
arrangement of the Company, Parent or their Affiliates. Section 6.9. Preservation of Books and Records. Each of Parent and Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and keep, or cause to be
preserved and kept, all original Books and Records in respect of the Business
in the possession of Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates for a
period of seven years after the Closing Date. Subject to Seller and its
Representatives executing and delivering a customary confidentiality agreement
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, Seller or its
Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice, shall have access during
normal business hours to examine and inspect such Books and Records solely in
connection with the preparation of any report or Tax return required to be
filed by Seller under applicable Regulations (but so as not to unduly disrupt
the normal course of operations of Purchaser or the Company) relating to the
conduct of the Business prior to the Closing. Purchaser and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Seller and its Representatives
with, or cause to be provided to Seller and its Representatives, such original
Books and Records of the Business relating to the conduct of the Business
prior to the Closing, as Seller shall reasonably request in connection with
any Action to which Seller is a party (other than any Action arising under
this Agreement). This Section 6.9 shall not restrict access of Seller and its
Representatives to Books and Records of the Company for purposes of the
reviews and activities under Section 2.6 and as and to the extent provided in
Section 6.2.

Section 6.10. RandW Insurance Policy. The Company and each Seller Party shall
provide reasonable and customary cooperation to Parent and Purchaser in
connection with the RandW Insurance Policy, including providing the insurance
company and its representatives with such information reasonably available to
the Company and customarily reviewed by the insurance companies and their
representatives in connection with issuing policies similar to the RandW
Insurance Policy; provided, however, in no event shall the Company be required
to make any representations or warranties with respect to information other
than the representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 and Article 4
of this Agreement. Promptly after it is received by Parent, Parent shall
deliver a copy of the final RandW Insurance Policy to the Company and Seller.
Parent shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates to not) amend, modify,
terminate or waive any provision regarding waiver of subrogation set forth in
the RandW Insurance Policy without the prior written consent of the Seller,
which consent may be given or withheld by Seller in its sole discretion.

Section 6.11. Release. Effective as of the Closing, in consideration for
Parent's acceptance of the limitations on Parent's right to indemnification
pursuant to Article 10, each Seller Party, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, agents, representatives, attorneys, successors, assigns,
dependents, heirs, executors and administrators, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally forever releases, acquits and discharges the Company, Parent
and its respective Affiliates (and any of the respective predecessors,
successors, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
attorneys, assigns, dependents, heirs, executors and administrators) from any
and all claims, rights, actions, suits, damages, losses, expenses,
liabilities, indebtedness and causes of actions, of whatever kind or nature
(including advancement or contribution) that existed or arose from the
beginning of time through the Closing, regardless of whether known or unknown,
and regardless of whether asserted to date. The foregoing shall not constitute
a release of claims with respect to (a) payments to the Parties Seller in
consideration for Interests to which the Seller Parties are entitled pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) claims arising under this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Transaction in each case, in effect
as of the Closing Date or (c) any right of indemnification in favor of, or
limitation of liability of, a current or former director, member, officer,
employee or manager of the Company pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company or pursuant to any liability insurance policies (or
the equivalent thereof) of the Company, in each case, in effect as of the
Closing Date. Each Seller Party (A) understands that the release contained in
this Section 6.11 is binding on such Seller Party and its Affiliates, agents,
representatives, attorneys, successors, assigns, dependents, heirs, executors
and administrators, and (B) represents and warrants that (x) it has had the
opportunity to consult with counsel of its choice, (y) it is fully informed of
the nature and contents of this release and (z) it has entered into this
release freely and without any threat or coercion whatsoever.

Section 6.12. Termination of Related Party Agreements. Except as provided on
Section 6.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Seller
Parties shall cause all accounts, arrangements or Contracts between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller, its Affiliates (other than the Company)
or any Related Party of the Seller Parties or the Company, on the other hand,
to be cancelled or terminated without any consideration or further liability
to any Party and without the need for any further documentation, immediately
prior to the Closing.

Section 6.13. Financing.

(a)Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to consummate
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment, at or prior to the Closing, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter
into all definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment or as may otherwise
be agreed (taking account the limitations on amendments and modifications to
the Debt Commitment Letter set forth below in this Section 6.13(a)), (iii)
satisfy (or, if determined by Parent to be advisable, obtain waivers with
respect to) all conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
applicable to, and within the control of, Parent or Purchaser in the Debt
Financing Commitment and in such definitive agreements and (iv) subject to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Financing Commitment, cause the lenders and
the other Persons providing such financing to provide the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date (provided that Parent and Purchaser shall not be required to
initiate legal proceedings against such lenders and other Persons to enforce
their obligations to provide the Debt Financing). Without limiting the
foregoing obligation, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall consent to any
amendment or modification to the Debt Financing Commitment if such amendment
or modification would (1) change the conditions precedent set forth therein in
any respect that would make such conditions materially less likely to be
satisfied by the Closing Date, (2) change the timing of the funding of the
commitments thereunder in any manner that would be reasonably expected to
materially delay the consummation of the Transaction, (3) change the cash
amount of the funding commitments thereunder to an amount below the amount
that is required, together with other financial resources of Parent and
Purchaser, to consummate the Transaction on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement or (4) otherwise adversely affect the ability of Parent and
Purchaser to enforce their rights under the Debt Financing Commitment or
consummate the Transaction on the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(collectively, the "Restricted Commitment Amendments") (provided, that subject
to the limitations set forth in this Section 6.13(a), Parent and Purchaser may
amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the Agreement Date). (b)In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent and
Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Purchaser (as
reasonably determined by Parent and Purchaser) than those contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment (taking into account all applicable "marketing flex"
provisions applicable thereto) in an amount, when taken together with other
financial resources of Parent and Purchaser, that will be sufficient for
Purchaser to consummate the Transaction upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses.

(c)Parent shall promptly notify Seller in writing: (i) of any material breach
or default by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or definitive
agreement related thereto of which Parent or Purchaser becomes aware; (ii) of
the receipt by Parent or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives of any notice or other communication from any Person with
respect to any actual or asserted breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement
related thereto; and (iii) if for any reason Parent or Purchaser believes in
good faith that there is a reasonable possibility that they will not be able
to obtain the financing contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements related thereto in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transaction.

(d)In order to assist with the Debt Financing (except in the case of the
matters covered in clause (iv), which relate solely to the Company and not to
Seller), the Company and each Seller Party shall promptly provide, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to promptly
provide, reasonable assistance and cooperation as Purchaser and its Affiliates
may reasonably request, including, but not limited to, (i) participating in a
reasonable number of presentations and meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings between senior management and representatives of the Company and
the Financing Sources, prospective lenders in respect of the Debt Financing
and rating agencies) and reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of
Purchaser and the Financing Sources, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda,
business projections, lender presentations and similar documents prepared in
connection with the Debt Financing, including execution and delivery of
customary representation letters in connection with bank information
memoranda, (iii) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources with
financial, due diligence material and other pertinent information regarding
the Company as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or the Financing
Sources and readily available to Seller including furnishing the Required
Information, (iv) subject to and contingent upon consummation of the Closing,
executing and delivering, as of the Closing Date, any definitive financing
documents, including any credit agreements, guarantees, pledge agreements,
security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other security documents or
other certificates, documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the
pledge of the collateral securing the Debt Financing and other matters
ancillary to the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of, and granting and perfecting of Encumbrances in, the collateral
securing the Debt Financing (including cooperation in connection with the
payoff of the indebtedness of the Company and the termination of related
Encumbrances provided no such Encumbrances shall extend to Excluded Assets),
(v) furnishing within the time period specified in the Debt Financing
Commitment, all documentation and other information required by regulators and authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and (vi) taking all
corporate or other actions, and providing such other reasonable assistance as
reasonably requested by Purchaser to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to Purchaser
on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing agreements in this Section
6.13, any cooperation requested by Parent or Purchaser shall not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or Seller and, in the
case of clause (iv) of the preceding sentence, the Company and its
Representatives shall not be required to execute or enter into or perform any
agreement with respect to the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective
prior to the Closing. The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or
disparage the Company. For purposes of this Section 6.13(d), references to
Debt Financing shall include any alternative financing obtained pursuant to
Section 6.13(b).

(e)None of the Seller Parties, the Company nor any of their respective
Representatives shall be required to take any action that would subject any of
them to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any
other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity, in each case in
connection with the Debt Financing (in the case of the Company, prior to the
Closing) or their performance of their respective obligations under this
Section 6.13 (except solely as and to the extent provided in clause (iv) of
the first sentence of Section 6.13(d)). Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Seller Parties, the Company and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and
the performance of their respective obligations under this Section 6.13 and
any information utilized in connection therewith; provided, that Parent shall
not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any Person to the
extent such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments or penalties result from a Seller Party's, the Company's or
their respective Representatives' acts or omissions constituting bad faith or
willful misconduct. Parent shall, promptly upon request of Seller or the
Company, and in any event within thirty (30) days of any such request,
reimburse Seller and the Company for any reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
fees, costs, expenses or other similar amounts (including those of its
Representatives) incurred by the Seller Parties or the Company in connection
with the Debt Financing in connection with the cooperation required by this
Section 6.13.

Section 6.14. Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser and the Seller Parties
agree that the Transaction shall exclude all Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities. Each Seller Party or its Affiliates (other than the Company)
shall retain all benefits and liabilities with respect to the Excluded Assets
and the Excluded Liabilities, and each Seller Party shall, and shall cause the
Company prior to the Closing, to distribute, transfer or assign, in each case
effective prior to the Closing, all of the Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities to Seller or its Affiliates. Section 6.15. Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.

(a)From the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), the Seller Parties shall not, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries not to, engage within the United States in the business of
selling cellular phones and related cellular service subscriptions at (i)
walk-in retail locations of ATandT, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, MetroPCS, Cricket
Wireless, Boost Mobile or similar national or regional cellular service
providers (collectively, "Cellular Service Providers") or (ii) at GameStop or
ThinkGeek walk-in retail locations (a "Competing Business"). In no event shall
the preceding sentence (i) restrict either Seller Party or any of its
Subsidiaries from holding or making investments not in excess of 5% of the
outstanding securities of any publicly-traded entity engaged in a Competing
Business, or (ii) restrict either Seller Party or any of its Subsidiaries from
(I) continuing the Simply Mac Business, (II) selling, buying and trading pre-
owned phones or related accessories, (III) continuing to engage in those
activities that Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company) are
currently engaged in other than through the ATandT Stores, (IV) continuing or
entering into new contractual arrangements with any Persons, including
Cellular Service Providers, provided that (1) those arrangements are not for
the purpose of the sale of cellular phones and related cellular service
subscriptions at walk-in retail locations of the Cellular Service Providers,
and (2) if any such contractual arrangements involve the sale by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries of cellular phones and the related cellular service
subscriptions at GameStop or ThinkGeek walk-in retail locations, then such
sales of cellular phones and the related cellular service subscriptions must
be "incidental" (the foregoing requirement being hereinafter referred to as
the "Incidental Sales Restriction"). For the purpose of the Incidental Sales
Restriction, the term "incidental" shall be defined as annual sales of
cellular phones (excluding pre-owned phones) and the related cellular service
subscriptions by Seller and its Subsidiaries at any such location of no more
than five percent (5%) of total annual sales by Seller and its Subsidiaries at
such location. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Seller CIC
Transaction is consummated, the restrictions in this Section 6.15(a) shall not
apply to the activities or operations of any Person that acquires the Seller
or such Person's Affiliates (other than the Seller and its Subsidiaries). If
Seller converts more than one hundred (100) of its GameStop or ThinkGeek walk-
in retail locations to Simply Mac walk-in retail locations (each, a "Simply
Mac Converted Operation"), then the Incidental Sales Restriction shall apply
to sales at Simply Mac Converted Operations other than to sales at the first
one hundred (100) of such Simply Mac Converted Operations. If, through a joint
venture or similar arrangement with a third party, Seller or a Subsidiary of
Seller, converts more than three hundred (300) of GameStop, ThinkGeek or
Simply Mac walk-in retail locations to a different retail concept under a
different brand or brands (each, a "Different Concept Converted Operation"),
then the Incidental Sales Restriction shall apply to sales at the Different
Concept Converted Operations other than to sales at the first three hundred
(300) of such Different Concept Converted Operations, provided that in no
event shall a Different Concept Converted Operation be an ATandT branded walk-in
retail location. (b)Except as disclosed on Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
during the Restricted Period, each Seller Party shall not, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through any Person or
contractual arrangement, (i) solicit for employment or hire any Person who is
an employee of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any Person who was employed by the Company in the six months prior to such
solicitation or hiring, (ii) induce or encourage any director, officer or
employee of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
terminate his or her employment with Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (iii) influence or attempt to influence any
customers, distributors or suppliers of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to divert their business to any competitor of the
Company or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such
customer, distributor or supplier and Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (including making any disparaging or negative
statements or communications about their respective businesses or discouraging
any such customer, distributor or supplier from maintaining the same business
relationships with Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries prior to the Closing), or (iv) disclose,
reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than Purchaser, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
managers, directors and employees, or use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, any confidential or proprietary information of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, that
the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a general solicitation to the public
through general advertising or similar methods of solicitation not
specifically directed at employees of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and any hiring as a result thereof, (ii) the
solicitation of any employee who has been terminated by Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries prior to any such solicitation
and any hiring as a result thereof or (iii) the hiring of any employee of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries who has
initiated discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect
solicitation by a Seller Party or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event a Seller CIC Transaction is consummated, the
restrictions in this Section 6.15(b) shall not apply to the activities or
operations of any Person that acquires Seller or such Person's Affiliates
(other than Seller and its Subsidiaries).

(c)Each Seller Party acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this Section
6.15 are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach by a
Seller Party or its Affiliates of any provision of this Section 6.15 may
result in irreparable injury to Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. Each Seller Party acknowledges that in the event of
such a breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law, Purchaser
may be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as well as
such other damages as may be appropriate.

(d)If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 6.15 are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of Purchaser and the
Seller Parties that these provisions shall be construed by the court in such a
manner as to impose only those restrictions on a Seller Party's conduct that
are reasonable in light of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to
the Company and Purchaser the benefits of this Agreement. If, in any judicial
proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of
this Section 6.15 because taken together they are more extensive than
necessary to assure to the Company and Purchaser the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by the Parties that the
provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate
provisions to be enforced in such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for
the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

Section 6.16. Cash Dividend. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause all
Cash of the Company to be dividended to Seller (if done prior to the
Contribution) or Holdco (if done following the Contribution), except for
$5,000,000; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to cause the
Company to dividend (i) any Cash that is required to be held by the Company
pursuant to Regulations or (ii) any Cash where the dividend or other transfer
or repatriation of such Cash would result in the payment of any Taxes
(withholding or otherwise) or penalties.

Section 6.17. Post-Closing Cooperation; Reimbursement of Specified Amount.

(a)Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company's officers,
directors and employees to provide reasonable and customary cooperation to
Seller and Seller's independent public accounting firm and third parties
advisors, including providing reasonable access during normal business hours
to the financial information of the Company, in connection with the
preparation, review and audit of Seller's consolidated financial statements
for Seller's 2018 fiscal year, and as applicable, any portion of Seller's 2019
fiscal year, provided, that such access will give due regard to minimizing
interference with the operations, activities and employees of the Company.

(b)Parent shall cause the Company to provide reasonable access to Seller and
Seller's counsel to any Company employees that might be reasonably be
requested in connection with any litigation involving Seller or any of its
Affiliates related to the Company's pre-Closing activities, excluding any
litigation involving this Agreement or the Transaction.

(c)In the event the Specified Amount is paid by the Company in accordance with
the Specified Agreement, Seller shall promptly following its receipt of
written notice from the Company of the Company's payment thereof (and in no
event more than ten Business Days following such receipt) reimburse the
Company by wire payment of the Specified Amount plus the employer portion of
any Taxes relating thereto as specified in such notice. The Company shall not
pay the Specified Amount unless the individual identified on Schedule 1.1(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule has executed a release of claims against
the Seller and its affiliates in such form as Seller may prescribe.

as of a particular date shall remain true, complete and correct as of such
date), except where any failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the Transaction in accordance with the

ARTICLE 8

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.1 Purchase Price Allocation. The Parties agree, because the Company
will be an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as of the Closing, that the purchase and sale of
the Interests hereunder will be treated as a purchase of the assets of the
Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Exhibit D describes the
principles that will be utilized to allocate the amounts paid and the
liabilities assumed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, adjusted as necessary to determine the Seller's amount realized and
Purchaser's cost of the purchased assets hereunder for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (which amount shall be determined in accordance with Exhibit D),
among the Company's assets in accordance with the general principles of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations pursuant thereto or any
successor provision and includes an example (based on the numbers set forth in
the Interim Financial Statements, as appropriately adjusted for tax purposes)
illustrating how these principles are to be applied. Within 30 days after the
adjustments to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price have been finalized in
accordance with Section 2.6, the Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a Form 8594
with an allocation that is consistent with the principles of Exhibit D and the
example set forth therein (the "Proposed Allocation"). If Seller does not
deliver a written objection to the Proposed Allocation (which objection may
only be raised to the extent the allocation is inconsistent with the
principles of Exhibit D and the example set forth therein) setting forth the
items of disagreement within 30 days of receipt of the Proposed Allocation, it
will deemed to be accepted by Seller and will be the final allocation (the
"Final Allocation"). If no agreement is reached within 30 days, the items of
dispute shall be referred to the Settlement Accountants for resolution. The
Settlement Accountants will address only the items of dispute and are required
to resolve such items in a manner that is consistent with the principles of
Exhibit D and the example set forth therein. Procedures and terms of engagement for this purpose will be
the same as set forth in Section 2.6 of this Agreement. The resolution
provided by the Settlement Accountant shall be deemed final by all parties,
and shall be the Final Allocation. None of the Parties will take a position on
any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation, and the Parties
shall file all Tax Returns and forms (including Form 8594 and comparable forms
under other Tax law) consistently with the Final Allocation, except as
required by a final determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) or
any comparable concept under applicable state or local law. For the avoidance
of doubt, the consistency requirement of the preceding sentence does not
extend to taking positions in connection with any audit or other proceeding
conducted by, or any litigation with, any Tax Authority, so that in the event
a Tax Authority raises any issues with respect to the Final Allocation each
Party may take any position and settle or otherwise compromise any such audit,
other proceeding or litigation in its discretion whether or not consistent
with the Final Allocation.

Section 8.2. Preparation of Tax Returns.

(a)Following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company (as defined after the
Reorganization) after the Closing Date that relate to any taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (each such period a
"Straddle Period" and each such Tax Return a "Straddle Period Tax Return"). No
later than five Business Days prior to the due date of any Straddle Period Tax
Return, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Taxes that are shown as
due on the Straddle Period Tax Return and are attributable to the portion of
the applicable Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, except to the
extent that all or a portion of the amount of such Taxes is included in
Indebtedness in a manner that results in a reduction in the Closing Purchase
Price. Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be submitted (with copies of any
relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available) to
Seller for Seller's review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) not less than fifteen days prior to the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return, or, for any Straddle Period Tax Return
due to be filed within 15 days after the Closing Date, as soon as practicable
after Closing.

(b)The Parties agree that the Tax Returns referenced in Section 8.2(a) do not
include any Tax Returns of the Company that are filed on a consolidated,
affiliated or similar group basis with Seller or other subsidiaries of Seller.
Seller shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, as
a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax
purposes before the Reorganization and as a limited liability company after
the Reorganization) after the Closing Date that relate to any Pre-Closing
Period. Seller shall be responsible for paying all Taxes that are shown or
required to be shown as due on any such Tax Return.

(c)The Parties agree that if there are state and local income Tax Returns to
be filed by the Company (prior to the Reorganization) after Closing that
relate to a Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall prepare and file such Tax
Returns, and pay any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. (d)Except as otherwise required by applicable Regulations, Purchaser shall
not, nor shall it permit or cause any of its Affiliates or the Company, to (i)
amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of
the Company for any period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) file any Tax Return of the Company for any period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date in a jurisdiction in
which the Company did not previously file Tax Returns, (iii) voluntarily
initiate any contact with any Tax Authority with respect to any Tax periods
(or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, or (iv) make any
election that has effect to a Tax period that includes the Closing Date or any
date prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
8.2(d) shall not be applicable to any action taken by Purchaser or the Company
in connection with any Tax proceeding for which Seller fails to assume control
as permitted by Section 8.6.

(e)Each Seller Party (and its Affiliates) covenant and agree not to make any
election to (or take any other action that would) cause the Company (following
the Reorganization) to be classified as anything other than an entity that is
disregarded as separate from Holdco for U.S. federal (and applicable state and
local) income tax purposes at the time of the Closing.

Section 8.3. Cooperation. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns,
audit examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to
Tax liabilities imposed on the Company for all taxable periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall, and shall each cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate with each other, as and to the extent reasonably requested,
including through the furnishing or making available during normal business
hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, or
other materials necessary or helpful.

Section 8.4. Certain Taxes. All transfer (including real property transfer),
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Transaction (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") will be paid 50% by Purchaser and
50% by Seller when due, and all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by Purchaser unless
Seller is required to file such Tax Returns under applicable Regulations.

Section 8.5. Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, except to the extent that Taxes are taken into
account in determining Indebtedness or have been included in Current
Liabilities, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be jointly and severally
liable for and shall pay, and agree to indemnify and hold Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company) harmless from and against (a) all Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Company for all Pre-Closing Periods and the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and any Losses
associated with such Taxes (or the non-payment thereof), (b) all Taxes and
Losses on account of any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in
Section 3.21 and (c) any Transfer Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to Section 8.4. Payment by Seller of any amount due under this
Section 8.5 shall be made within 15 days following written notice from
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Indemnifying Parties'
indemnification obligations under this Section 8.5 shall not be subject to any
of the limits on indemnification set forth in Article 10. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated elsewhere in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.21 and the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 8.5 shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations for the Taxes at issue.

Section 8.6. Tax Proceedings. To the extent that either Seller Party may be
responsible under Section 8.5 for a Tax with respect to a Pre-Closing Period,
Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to control the
prosecution, settlement or compromise of any proceeding involving such Tax;
provided, that to the extent that any such proceeding could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse post-Closing impact on Parent, Purchaser or the
Company (or any of their respective Affiliates), (a) Purchaser shall be
entitled to participate in any such proceeding at its sole cost and expense
and (b) Seller shall not settle or otherwise compromise any such proceeding
without Purchaser's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Seller shall have the sole right to control the audit,
prosecution, settlement or compromise of any Tax proceedings related to Taxes
filed as part of a consolidated, affiliated or similar group basis with
Seller, or other Subsidiaries of Seller.

Section 8.7. Pre-Closing Reorganization. The Parties agree that the
Reorganization is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code. None of the Parties or their respective Affiliates
will take a position on any Tax Return or in any proceeding inconsistent with
such tax treatment.

ARTICLE 9

TERMINATION; WAIVER

Section 9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transaction
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a)by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller at any time prior to the
Closing;

(b)by Purchaser or Seller (by written notice to the other Party) if (i) any
Governmental Body shall have issued a Court Order restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Transaction and such Court Order is or shall have
become non-appealable or (ii) the Transaction has not been consummated by
March 21, 2019 (the "Outside Date"); provided, that no Party may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) if such Party's failure to fulfill
any of its obligations under this Agreement shall have been the reason that
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date;

(c)by Seller (by written notice to Purchaser) if (i) there shall have been a
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Purchaser in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) are incapable
of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) there shall have been a breach
by Parent or Purchaser of any of their covenants or agreements in this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(c) is incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date, and Parent or Purchaser, as the case may
be, has not cured such breach within the earlier of 20 Business Days after
receipt by Purchaser of written notice from Seller or the Company thereof or
the Outside Date; provided, that neither the Company nor any Seller Party has
materially breached any of its material obligations hereunder; or (d)by Purchaser (by written notice to the Company) if (i) there shall have
been a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or a Seller
Party in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(b)
are incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) there shall have
been a breach by the Company or a Seller Party of any of their covenants or
agreements in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section
7.3(c) is incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date, and the Company or
the relevant Seller Party, as the case may be, has not cured such breach
within the earlier of 20 Business Days after receipt by the Company or a
Seller Party of written notice from Purchaser thereof or the Outside Date;
provided, that neither Purchaser nor Parent has materially breached any of its
material obligations hereunder.

(e)by Purchaser or Seller (by written notice to the other Party) if (i) all of
the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 were
satisfied or waived as of the date the Closing should have been consummated
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and could have been satisfied
or would have been waived assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) Seller has
confirmed to Purchaser in writing that (A) all of the conditions to the Seller
Parties' and the Company's obligations to consummate the Closing have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing and could have been satisfied or would have been
waived assuming a Closing would occur) and, in the case of termination by
Purchaser under this Section 7.1(e), Purchaser and Parent have not materially
breached any of their material obligations hereunder, and (B) the Seller
Parties are ready, willing and able to cause the Closing to occur and (iii)
Purchaser fails to complete the Closing within two Business Days after the
later of (A) delivery of the confirmation by the Seller Parties required by
clause (ii) above and (B) the date by which the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.3(a); or

(f)by Purchaser, if between the Agreement Date and the Closing, an event,
change, circumstance, occurrence, result, state of facts or condition occurs
that has had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement or the abandonment of the Transaction pursuant to Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any Party or its Affiliates, directors, officers or
stockholders, other than (a) for the provisions of Section 3.17, Section 4.6
and Section 5.5 relating to broker's fees and finder's fees, Section 6.2(e)
relating to confidentiality, Section 11.7 relating to public announcements,
Section 9.3 relating to the Reverse Termination Fee, Section 11.5 relating to
notices, Section 11.6 relating to governing law and submission to jurisdiction
and this Section 9.2 and (b) liability of a Party, as the case may be, for
Fraud or Material Breach (as defined below) of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement under this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination, subject in the case of Purchaser to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.3 relating to the Reverse Termination Fee, Section 11.6 relating to
submission to jurisdiction and Section 11.10 relating to personal liability.
The provisions of Section 9.2, Article 11 and all applicable definitions set
forth in Section 1.1 and Section 1.2 and the interpretations provisions of
Section 1.3 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement. No
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
under the Non-Disclosure Agreement, all of which shall survive termination of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. As used herein, the term
"Material Breach" means a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, which
act or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, with
the knowledge that the act or failure to act constitutes a breach. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement, the Financing Source
Parties will have no liability to the Seller Parties, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect
stockholders hereunder or under the Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise
relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by such agreements
(including for any willful and material breach); provided that the foregoing
shall not preclude any liability of the Financing Source Parties to Purchaser
under the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment (and the related fee letters)
or the Debt Financing.

Section 9.3. Reverse Termination Fee; Limitation on Liability.

(a)Solely in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(e), Parent shall pay, or cause Purchaser to pay, to Seller a fee in the
amount of $25,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee"). Payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable after
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) (and, in any event,
within five Business Days thereof) by wire transfer of same-day funds to the
account designated by Seller to Parent in writing. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay, or
cause Purchaser to pay, the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b)In the event that the Reverse Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to
Section 9.3(a), the receipt by Seller of the Reverse Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Seller Parties, the Company and any other Person (other than Purchaser)
against Purchaser and Parent and their respective former, current and future
equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees and any and all former, current and
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all
former, current and future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees,
successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (each of the foregoing, a
"Purchaser Related Party," and collectively, the "Purchaser Related Parties"),
and no Purchaser Related Party shall have any other liability or obligation
(other than to Purchaser) for any Losses suffered or incurred by any Seller
Party, the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement (and the termination hereof) or the Debt Financing Commitment or the
Transaction (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, including any breach of this Agreement or the Debt Financing
Commitments (including any willful and material breach), and none of the
Seller Parties, the Company or any other Person (other than Purchaser) shall
be entitled to bring or maintain any other Action against Purchaser or any
other Purchaser Related Party arising out of this Agreement or any Debt
Financing Commitment, or any of the Transaction or any matters forming the
basis for such termination, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort,
or otherwise. (c)Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements
contained in Section 9.3(b) are an integral part of the this Agreement and the
Transaction and (ii) in light of the difficulty of accurately determining
actual damages with respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e), the right to such payment
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the Losses that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated
damages (and not a penalty).

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without
limiting Seller's right in respect of specific performance pursuant to Section
11.12 and any rights under the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant Section 9.1(e) and the Reverse Termination Fee is paid to Seller,
then the maximum aggregate liability of Purchaser and any other Purchaser
Related Party under this Agreement or relating to the Transaction shall be
limited to an amount equal to the Reverse Termination Fee, and in no event
shall any Seller Party, the Company or any other Person seek to recover any
money damages (including consequential, indirect or punitive damages) in
excess of such amount. So long as this Agreement shall not have been
terminated, the Seller Parties shall be entitled to pursue both a grant of
specific performance under Section 11.12 and the payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee under Section 9.3(a), but under no circumstances shall the
Seller Parties be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance under Section 11.12 and an award of money damages, including all
or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Financing
Source Party shall have any liability or obligation to any Seller Party, the
Company, any of its or their Affiliates or any of its or their direct or
indirect stockholders relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Debt
Financing Commitment or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged
to be have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or
at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and no Seller Party or the Company
shall seek to, and shall cause its and their Affiliates and its and their
direct and indirect stockholders not to seek to, recover any money damages
(including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, or damages on
account of a willful and material breach) or obtain any equitable relief from
or with respect to any Financing Source Party.



ARTICLE 10

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.1 Survival Period. (i) The Parent Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years after the Closing Date, (ii) the Company's and Seller Parties'
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.4 and Section 4.5 shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period of 20
years after the Closing Date, (iii) the Company Fundamental Representations
(other than those contained in Section 3.4 and Section 4.5) shall survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period of six years after
the Closing Date, (iv) the Seller Parties' and the Company's representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.21 relating to tax matters shall survive
the Closing until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of

20 years after the Closing Date, except in each case that any written claim for breach thereof made in good faith with reasonable
specificity (to the extent known at such time) prior to such expiration date
and delivered to the Party against whom indemnification is sought shall
survive until finally resolved thereafter and, as to any such claim, such
applicable expiration will not affect the rights to indemnification of the
Party making such claim. The representations and warranties of the Parties,
other than (a) the Company Fundamental Representations, (b) the Parent
Fundamental Representations, (c) the Seller Parties' and the Company's
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.21 relating to tax
matters, or (d) claims involving Fraud, shall not survive the Closing. The
Parties further acknowledge and agree that the time periods set forth in this
Section 10.1 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result
of arms' length negotiation among the Parties and that they intend for the
time periods to be enforced as agreed by the Parties. Other than (w) the
Parent Fundamental Representations, (x) the Company Fundamental
Representations, (y) the Seller Parties' and the Company's representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.21 relating to tax matters and (z) claims
involving Fraud, which shall survive the Closing, as and to the extent
provided in this Section 10.1 above, no other representations and warranties
of any of the Parties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and all of
such other representations and warranties shall expire at the Closing.

Section 10.2. Indemnification Provisions for Parent's Benefit. Subject to the
limitations set forth in Article 10 or Article 8, each Seller Party, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its successors, executors, administrators, estate,
heirs and assigns (collectively, for the purposes of this Section 10.2, the
"Seller Indemnifying Parties," and each individually, a "Seller Indemnifying
Party") shall jointly and severally save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser, Parent, and each of their respective directors, managers, officers,
employees, Affiliates, direct and indirect partners, equityholders, agents,
attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Parent
Indemnified Parties") from and against and shall compensate and reimburse any
Losses of the Parent Indemnified Parties as required by Article 8 or on
account of (i) any breach by the Company or any Seller Party of the Company
Fundamental Representations, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by
the Company or any Seller Party contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, (iii) any Excluded Liabilities or any Losses arising from the
transfers, distributions or assignments of the Excluded Assets and the
Excluded Liabilities in accordance with Section 6.14 and (iv) all Losses with
respect to each of the four matters (and only those four matters) set forth on
Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedules under the caption "Covered Matters."
Other than as provided in this Section 10.2 and except in the case of Fraud,
no indemnification shall be due or payable by the Seller Indemnifying Parties,
and no claim will be made against them, with respect to Losses incurred in
connection with a breach of representations and warranties, and recovery under
the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
the Parent Indemnified Parties and the provisions set forth in this clause
will apply even if the RandW Insurance Policy is never issued by an insurer, the
RandW Insurance Policy is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner after
issuance, or the Parent Indemnified Parties make a claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy and such claim is denied by the RandW insurer. None of the
indemnification limitations set forth in this Section 10.2 shall limit
Parent's rights, remedies or recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy. Section 10.3. Indemnification Provisions for the Seller Parties' Benefit.
Subject to the provisions of this Article 10, from and after the Closing,
Parent and Purchaser jointly and severally agree to save, defend, indemnify
and hold the Seller Parties and their respective employees, directors,
managers, officers, direct and indirect partners or equityholders,
representatives, affiliates, successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") harmless from and against any Losses sustained or suffered by the
Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent caused by or arising out of, or by
reason of (i) any breach by Parent or Purchaser of the Parent Fundamental
Representations; (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document; (iii) any claims of any
landlord or sub-landlord under any Real Property Leases for actions or
inactions taken by Purchaser, Parent or the Company after the Closing and (iv)
any Losses that arise as a direct result of the Reorganization and that would
not have arisen had the Reorganization not occurred and Seller had sold
Purchaser the Shares; provided, that the indemnity under this clause (iv) (A)
shall not include any Losses that result from (1) the breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.21 or (2) a breach by
either Seller Party (or its Affiliates) of any covenant under Article VIII and
(B) with respect to Taxes, shall only include Taxes (of the Seller Parties and
their Affiliates) to the extent the amount of such Taxes exceeds the amount of
Taxes that would have been incurred by Seller and its Affiliates if the
Reorganization had not occurred, Seller had sold the Shares to the Purchaser,
and a valid and timely election pursuant to Section 336(e) of the Code (and
any corresponding provision under state, local or foreign law) had been made
in connection with the sale of the Shares. Notwithstanding anything provided
in this Agreement to the contrary, no indemnification shall be payable by
Parent and Purchaser pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence of this
Section 10.3 with respect to any claim asserted by a Seller Indemnified Party
on account of any breach by Parent or Purchaser of the representations and
warranties contained in Article 5 after the expiration of the applicable
survival period prescribed for such representation and warranty in Section
10.1 (except that any written claim made in good faith with reasonable
specificity, to the extent known at such time, prior to such expiration date
and delivered to Parent shall survive thereafter until finally resolved and,
as to any such claim, such applicable expiration will not affect the rights to
indemnification of Seller Indemnified Parties). For the avoidance of doubt,
the survival period in Section 10.1 shall not apply to or limit right of
Seller Indemnified Parties to be indemnified and held harmless on account of
claims specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 10.3.

Section 10.4. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Seller Parties and
Parent agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 10
as an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price for all Tax purposes and shall
be treated as such by Parent and Seller on their Tax Returns to the greatest
extent permitted by applicable Regulations.

Section 10.5. Matters Involving Third Parties.

(a)If any third party notifies any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with
respect to any matter (including for the avoidance of doubt the matters set
forth on Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedules) (a "Third-Party Claim") that
gives rise to a claim for indemnification against another Party (the
"Indemnifying Party") under this Article 10, then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly (and in any event within fifteen Business Days after receiving notice
of the Third Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing (a
"Notice"); provided, however, that failure to give such Notice within such
fifteen-Business Day period or otherwise shall not limit the right of an
Indemnified Party to recover hereunder from any Indemnifying Party except to
the extent that such Indemnifying Party suffers any material prejudice or material harm
with respect to such claim as a result of such failure except and to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate actual loss or actual
prejudice (and in any event, solely to the extent of such loss or prejudice)
as a result of such failure.

(b)As between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, in the case of
any Third-Party Claims for which indemnification is sought, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled at its cost and expense to (i) conduct and control any
proceedings or negotiations with such third party, (ii) perform and control or
direct the performance of any required activities, (iii) take all other steps
to settle or defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnified Party is
given the opportunity to reasonably participate in such defense and the
Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party unless the settlement includes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party with respect to the claim and no additional obligation,
restriction or Losses shall be imposed on the Indemnified Party other than
solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be
indemnified hereunder), and (iv) employ counsel to contest any such claim or
liability; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume control of such defense, if the claim for which the Indemnifying Party
seeks to assume control: (A) seeks non-monetary, equitable or injunctive
relief, (B) involves criminal allegations, proceedings, indictments or
investigations, (C) involves an actual conflict of interest with respect to
the Indemnified Party, or (D) involves a claim for which, upon petition by the
Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend. The Indemnifying Party
shall, within 30 days after delivery of the Notice to the Indemnifying Party
(or sooner, if the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires) (the "Dispute
Period"), notify the Indemnified Party of its intention as to the conduct and
control of the defense of such claim, provided that the Indemnified Party and
its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel. Until
the Indemnified Party has received notice of the Indemnifying Party's election
whether to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps
to defend (but may not settle) such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party
for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the
defense thereof. Once the Indemnifying Party has made such election, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control) any
such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at such
Indemnified Party's expense. If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume
the defense of any such claim, or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify
the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period of the Indemnifying Party's
election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend against such
claim (provided that the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnifying Party will remain
responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer as a result of
such Third-Party Claim to the extent subject to indemnification under this
Article 10.

(c)In the event of any conflict between this Section 10.5 and Article 8,
Article 8 shall govern. Section 10.6. Direct Claims. Any indemnification claim by an Indemnified Party
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by the
Indemnified Party by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice
thereof. Such written notice shall summarize the basis for the indemnification
claim based on the information reasonably available at that time to the
Indemnified Party. The failure to give written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, unless, and
then solely to the extent that, the rights of the parties from whom indemnity
is sought are materially prejudiced as a result of such failure; provided,
however, that no such notice shall have any effect or be valid if it is given
following the end of any applicable survival period provided for in Section
10.1. The Indemnifying Party shall have 20 days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not
so respond within such 20-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have accepted such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly pay any amounts owed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 10.7. Further Limitations and Qualifications.

(a)The remedies provided in Article 8 and this Article 10 shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedies available to any Party against any other Party
with respect to any claim arising under this Agreement or any certificate
delivered in connection therewith and the facts and circumstances relating and
pertaining hereto (whether any such claim shall be made in contract, breach of
warranty, tort or otherwise), other than for claims involving Fraud or
specific performance under Section 11.12.

(b)For purposes of both determining (i) the amount of Losses arising from a
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation of the Company or any Seller Party in this Agreement and (ii)
whether any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation has been
breached or is inaccurate, any limitations or qualifications as to dollar
amount or materiality (or similar concept) set forth in such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation shall be disregarded.

Section 10.8. Remedies Not Affected by Inspection, Disclosure or Knowledge. If
the Transaction is consummated, (subject to the limitations on survival as
provided in Section 10.1), Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to
seek indemnity or any other remedies for any Losses arising out of or relating
to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein,
notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed
knowledge of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Representatives in
respect of any fact or circumstance that reveals the occurrence of any such
breach, whether before or after the execution and delivery hereof. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Seller Party agrees that as knowledge or
lack of reliance shall not be a defense in law or equity to any claim of
breach of representation, warranty or covenant by a Seller Party herein, each
Seller Party shall not in any proceeding concerning a breach or alleged breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant herein, or any indemnity thereof,
seek information concerning knowledge or reliance of Purchaser or Parent or
any of their respective Representatives, through deposition, discovery or
otherwise, or seek to introduce evidence or argue in any proceeding regarding
the knowledge or lack of reliance of Purchaser, Parent or any of their
respective Representatives prior to the Closing on or with respect to any such
representations, warranties or covenants. Section 10.9. Acknowledgements; and Release. Parent and Purchaser hereby
acknowledge that, following the Closing, except for claims of Fraud and claims
made pursuant to Section 8.5 or Section 10.2, the RandW Insurance Policy shall
be the sole and exclusive source of recovery and remedy for any Losses
sustained, suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates resulting from any breach, misstatement, misrepresentation,
inaccuracy or omission by any Seller Party or the Company of their respective
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any certificate
delivered in connection with this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing,
except for claims of Fraud and claims arising under this Agreement, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company, on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of its current and former officers,
directors, employees, partners, members, advisors, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges each Seller Party and each of
its respective Affiliates and each of their respective current and former
officers, directors, employees, partners, managers, members, advisors,
attorneys, financial advisors, lenders, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Released Parties") of and from any and all Actions, causes of action,
suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts,
bonds, contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), and claims and
demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity which the Releasing Parties may
have against each of the Released Parties, now or in the future, in each case
in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to Seller's ownership of the
Company occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 11.1. Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Ancillary Documents) and the Non-

among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
other prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
(b) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise; provided, however,
that Purchaser shall be entitled to assign this Agreement to an Affiliate and
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be entitled to assign their rights (but not

CIC Transaction.

Section 11.2. Validity. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and, to such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.

writing by the Parties at any time before or after the Closing.

Section 11.9(b), Section 11.10, Section 11.12(b) and this Section 11.3 (and

Section 11.6(b), Section 11.8, Section 11.10, Section 11.12(b) and thi s Section 11.3) may not be amended, supplemented, modified, waived or

or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument, in writing,
signed on behalf of the Party or Parties providing the extension or waiver.
The failure of any Party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 11.6. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process.

(a)This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely
within the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. With respect to any action or claim arising
out of or relating to the Transaction or any document or instrument delivered
in connection therewith, the Parties hereby expressly and irrevocably (a)
agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court located in the State of Delaware (and in the absence of
federal jurisdiction, the parties consent to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts located in the State of Delaware), (b) agree
not to bring any action related to the Transaction or any document or
instrument delivered in connection therewith in any other court (except to
enforce the judgment of such courts), (c) agree not to object to venue in such
courts or to claim that such forum is inconvenient and (d) agree that notice
or the service of process in any proceeding shall be properly served or
delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 11.5. Final
judgment by such courts shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any manner
permitted by applicable Regulations.

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the next sentence, each of the Parties agrees that (i) it will not bring or
support any Action against the Financing Source Parties, in any way relating
to this Agreement or the Transaction, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment, the
Debt Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection therewith
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Regulations exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and, in each case, appellate courts thereof)
and (ii) any such Action shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York. Each Seller Party further agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their direct and indirect stockholders not to, bring or
support any Action against any Financing Source Party, in any way relating to
this Agreement or the Transaction, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment, the Debt Financing or
the definitive agreements executed in connection therewith or the performance
thereof.

Section 11.7. Public Announcements. On and after the Agreement Date and
through the Closing Date, the Parties shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Transaction, and no Party shall issue any
press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other
party's written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prevent a
Party from publishing any press release or from making any and all public
disclosures (i) which such Party reasonably believes to be legally required by
it to comply with securities laws or regulations or rules of the New York
Stock Exchange or (ii) to comply with the requests of a Governmental Body,
provided that, to the extent possible under the circumstances, the Party
making any such public disclosures shall consult with the other Parties and
consider in good faith the views of such other Parties prior to making such
disclosure.

Section 11.8. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTION OR TO THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR
THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF.

Section 11.9. Parties in Interest.

(a)This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each Party and its successors and permitted assigns and, except as provided in
Section 6.7, Article 2 and Section 11.15, nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), (i) the provisions of the last
sentence of Section 9.2 and Section 9.3(e) shall be enforceable against Seller
(but not Purchaser) by each Financing Source Party and (ii) the provisions of
this Section 11.9(b), Section 11.3, Section 11.6(b), Section 11.8, Section
11.10 and Section 11.12 shall be enforceable against all parties to this
Agreement by each Financing Source Party.

Section 11.10. Personal Liability. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in
the Non-Disclosure Agreement, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as Parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "Contracting
Parties"). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any current,
former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee
of, and any financial advisor or lender (including any Financing Sources) to,
any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or
lender (including any Financing Source) to, any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any
claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of,
in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance, or breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by Regulations,
each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by
Regulations, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all
rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available
at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity
form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting
Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on
theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination,
sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement.

Section 11.11. Expenses. Except as set forth in this Agreement, each of the
Parties will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transaction, including all legal, accounting, investment
banking and other expenses incurred by it or on its behalf, whether or not
such transactions are consummated.

Section 11.12. Specific Performance.

(a)The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Subject to
Section 9.3(d) and Section 11.12(b), the Parties acknowledge and agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by either Seller Party or the
Company, on the one hand, or Purchaser or Parent, on the other hand, of any of
their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller Parties and the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by another party
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other parties under this
Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal remedy and
without bond or other security being required. The pursuit of specific
enforcement by any party hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or
waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in
equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time. (b)Subject to Section 9.3(d), it is acknowledged and agreed that the Seller
Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance against Parent and
Purchaser of the obligation of Parent and Purchaser to cause the Closing
Purchase Price to be funded in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
but only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3
have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions
assuming a Closing would occur); (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the remainder of the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price is funded at the Closing; (iii) Purchaser and Parent fail to
complete the Closing pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.3; and (iv)
each Seller Party has confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, and Purchaser and
Parent otherwise comply with their respective obligations hereunder, then the
Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall either
Seller Party be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's
obligation to cause the Estimated Closing Purchase Price to be funded at the
Closing or to consummate the Transaction if the Debt Financing has not been
funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the remainder of the Estimated
Closing Purchase Price were funded at the Closing).

(c)Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy. Subject to
Section 11.12(b) and Section 9.3(d), Seller and Company, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by a Party, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Subject to
Section 11.12(b) and Section 9.3(d), the Parties further agree that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 11.12, a Party shall not in
any respect be deemed to have waived its right to seek at any time any other
form of relief that may be available to such Party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section
11.12 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this Section 11.12 shall require a Party to institute any proceeding
for (or limit a Party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this Section 11.2 prior to or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under Article 9 (and pursuing monetary damages after
such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant
to this Section 11.12 or anything set forth in this Section 11.2 restrict or
limit a Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of Article 9. Section 11.13. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received
counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by facsimile, "portable document
format" (PDF), electronic transmission or otherwise) by all of the Parties.

Section 11.14. Company Disclosure Schedule. The representations and warranties
contained in Article 3 and Article 4 are qualified by reference to the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The Parties agree that the Company Disclosure Schedule is
not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the Company or the Seller Parties, as
applicable, except as and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement.
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Company Disclosure Schedule may
include items or information which the Company or the Seller Parties are not
required to disclose under this Agreement. Inclusion of information in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to the Company or the Seller Parties. Parent and
Purchaser acknowledge that headings have been inserted on the individual
schedules included in the Company Disclosure Schedule for the convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any
of the provisions of the Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule. Cross
references that may be contained in certain schedules contained in the Company
Disclosure Schedule to other schedules contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedule are not all‑inclusive. Information contained in various schedules
contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or sections and subsections of
the schedules contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule may be applicable
to other schedules or sections and subsections and, accordingly, every matter,
document or item referred to, set forth or described in one schedule contained
in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed under each
and every part, category or heading of the Company Disclosure Schedule and all
other schedules contained therein and shall be deemed to qualify the
representations and warranties of the Company in the Agreement, to the extent
that the applicability of such matter, document or item is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure without reference to any underlying
documentation.

Section 11.15. Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 11.16. No Conflict.

(a)Each of the Parties (i) hereby confirms that no engagement that either
Pepper Hamilton LLP or Holland and Hart LLP has undertaken or may undertake on
behalf of the Company, the Seller Parties or any of their respective current
or former equityholders or Affiliates will be asserted by any of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser either as a conflict of interest with respect to, or as a
basis to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify either Pepper Hamilton
LLP or Holland and Hart LLP from, any current or future representation of the
Company, the Seller Parties or any of their respective current or former
equityholders or Affiliates, (ii) hereby waives any conflict of interest that
exists on or prior to the Closing, and any other basis that might be asserted
to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify Pepper Hamilton LLP or Holland
and Hart LLP in any representation of the Company, the Seller Parties or any of
their respective current or former equityholders or Affiliates with respect to
any such matter and (iii) hereby waives any conflict of interest that might be
asserted to exist after the Closing, and any other basis that might be
asserted to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify Pepper Hamilton LLP or
Holland and Hart LLP in any representation of the Seller Parties or any of their current or former equityholders or Affiliates
with respect to any such matter.

(b)Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company, for itself and its Affiliates,
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that communications and attorney
work-product documentation between the Company and Pepper Hamilton LLP and
Holland and Hart LLP, made exclusively in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
Action exclusively arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction, are privileged
communications and documentation between the Company and such counsel, will
not pass and become an asset or property of the Company or the insurance
carrier providing the RandW Insurance Policy following the Closing. From and
after the Closing, each of Purchaser and the Company, on behalf of itself and
its respective Affiliates, waives and will not assert against the Company, or
against any manager, director, member, partner, officer, employee or affiliate
of the Company, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication exclusively relating to this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction, between either of Pepper
Hamilton LLP or Holland and Hart LLP and the Company or Seller occurring prior
to the Closing in connection with any representation from and after the
Closing. Parent and Purchaser further agree that Pepper Hamilton LLP, Holland
and Hart LLP and their respective partners and employees are third party
beneficiaries of this Section 11.16.

executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
