ARTICLE I

_The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "),
and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _ _DGCL__ ")
and in this Agreement.

 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the later of (a) the third
Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied or
waived in accordance with this Agreement, and (b) the third Business Day after
the final day of the Marketing Period or such earlier date as may be specified
by Parent on no less than two Business Days prior notice to the Company. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _ _Closing
Date__ ". For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Business Day__ " shall
mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or
Sunday or other day on which banks are required or authorized to close in the
City of New York. The closing of the Carveout Transaction shall occur
concurrently with the Closing (it being understood that the Closing of the
Carveout Transaction shall not be a condition to Closing).

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _ _Delaware
Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties
in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _
_Effective Time__ ").

 



2 ARTICLE II

_Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation _

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The parties hereto shall take all

Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety in connection with
the completion of the Merger to read identically to the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Collective
Brands, Inc.", and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Charter__ "), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.11(e)).

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Bylaws__ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 6.11(e)).

ARTICLE III

 

 _Officers and Directors_

_of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of

ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

 



3 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _
_Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company
or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) Shares owned by
stockholders (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares (the " _ _Dissenting Shares__ ",
and together with the Shares referred to in the immediately preceding clause
(i), the " _ _Excluded Shares__ "), (iii) Shares that are Company Restricted
Stock, which are governed by the provisions of Section 4.3(b) and (iv) Shares
owned by Blum and certain of its Affiliates that are transferred to Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be converted into the right to
receive $21.75 per Share in cash (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__
"), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly representing any of the Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, without
interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(g).

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), for the
benefit of the Record Holders of Shares entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration and pursuant to a paying agent agreement in customary
form, cash in immediately available funds in the aggregate amount necessary
for the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 4.1(a) (such
cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). If a
Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its
rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, (i) such Shares shall cease to be Excluded Shares and (ii)
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its
demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a
combination of the foregoing, and in each case, with maturities not exceeding
three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) shall be returned to
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(e). To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment pursuant to Section 4.1(a), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
all such cash payments under Section 4.1(a).

 



4 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares, Company Restricted Stock or
Shares owned by Blum and certain of its Affiliates that are transferred to
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time) (each, a " _ _Record Holder of
Shares__ ") (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to
be in customary form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) in exchange for the amount to which such Record
Holder of Shares is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section
4.1(a). If any Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares pursuant to Section
4.2(a), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent, promptly (and
in any event within two Business Days) after the date on which such Excluded
Shares cease to be Excluded Shares, to mail to the applicable Record Holder of
Shares the letter of transmittal and instructions referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such Shares. Upon
delivery of the letter of transmittal duly executed by the applicable Record
Holder of Shares and the surrender of a Certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu of
the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.2(h)) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented
by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(f)) and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or affidavits of loss, as the case may be. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares (other than Company Restricted Stock) that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check or wire
transfer for any cash to be delivered upon due surrender of the Certificate
may be issued or made to such transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent together with the
applicable letter of transmittal, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

 



5 (c) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and the Depository Trust Company (" _ _DTC__ ") to ensure that (i) if the
Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing
Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the product of
(x) the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (such
amount, the " _ _DTC Payment__ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in
cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance
with the procedures set forth in Section 4.2(b), exchanged for the amount in
cash in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is
entitled pursuant to this Article IV (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(h)), to be paid by check or wire transfer to
an account designated by such holder.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the Record Holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares, Company Restricted Stock or Shares owned
by Blum and certain of its Affiliates that are transferred to Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the amount to which such Record Holder of Shares is entitled as a
result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(f)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Record Holders of
Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interests of any such
holders or their successors, assignees or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term " _
_Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature (including any person as defined
in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) and (ii) the term " _ _Law__ " or "
_ _Laws__ " shall mean any domestic or foreign laws, statutes, ordinances,
rules (including rules of common law), regulations, codes, Orders or legally
enforceable requirements enacted, issued, adopted, or promulgated by any
Governmental Entity and any judicial interpretation thereof.

 



6 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.2(h)) equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares represented
by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless
and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost
its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting
Shares. Unless and until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively
withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with
respect to Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect
thereto. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or
any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



7 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, (i) shall be cancelled without payment if such
Company Stock Option has an exercise price greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration and (ii) if the exercise price is not greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration, shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive from
the Company, in full settlement of such Company Stock Option, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share under
such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

(b) _Restricted Shares_.

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock
granted prior to March 19, 2012 shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive from the Company, in full settlement of such share
of Company Restricted Stock, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three Business Days after the
Effective Time), an amount in cash, for each share of Company Restricted
Stock, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock
granted on or after March 19, 2012, which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive a cash
payment from the Company equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, payable
within 10 Business Days after the applicable vesting date of such share of
Company Restricted Stock, in full settlement of such share of Company
Restricted Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such share of Company Restricted Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any vesting schedule and any acceleration of vesting

 _Representations and Warranties_

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company SEC Reports filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC on or
after January 28, 2009 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in
each case, any risk factor disclosures set forth under the heading "Risk
Factors" and any disclosure of risks that are predictive or forward-looking in
nature (" _ _Excluded Disclosure__ ")) ( _provided_ that nothing in the
Company SEC Reports shall be deemed to modify or qualify the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1(a) ( _Organization, Good Standing and
Qualification_ ), 5.1(b) ( _Capital Structure),_ 5.1(c) ( _Corporate
Authority; Approval and Fairness_ ) and 5.1(j) ( _Takeover Statutes; Rights
Agreement_ )) or in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to or
simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure
Letter__ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item
is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub that:

 



11 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a
foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so organized, validly existing, qualified, in good standing or to have such
power or authority, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws and the certificates and bylaws or comparable
organizational and governing documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries
set forth on Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _
_Material Subsidiaries__ "), each as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so made available is in full force and effect on the date of this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term:

(i) " _ _Affiliate__ " means, when used with respect to any Person, any other
Person who is an "affiliate" of that Person within the meaning of Rule 405
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _ _Securities Act__ "); 

(ii) " _ _Company Material Adverse Effect__ " means any change, event or
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with all other changes,
events or occurrences, has a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of either
(1) the PLG Business, taken as a whole, or (2) the PSS Business, taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following, and no change,
event or occurrence arising out of or resulting from the following, shall
constitute or be taken into account in determining whether a "Company
Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or may, would or could occur:

 



12 (A)(1) changes, events or occurrences generally affecting the
economy, credit, financial or capital markets, or regulatory, legislative or
political conditions in the United States or other countries in which the PLG
Business or the PSS Business conduct operations, including changes in interest
and exchange rates, or (2) changes, events or occurrences that are the result
of factors generally affecting the industries in which the PLG Business or the
PSS Business primarily operate or in which the products or services of the PLG
Business or the PSS Business are primarily produced, distributed or sold;

(B) changes or prospective changes in GAAP, applicable regulatory accounting
standards or applicable Law or in the interpretation or enforcement thereof;

(C) any geopolitical conditions, act of terrorism or an outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or war (whether or not declared) or any epidemics,
pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or any other natural disasters
(whether or not caused by any Person or any force majeure event) or any other
national or international calamity or crisis;

(D) execution, announcement, pendency or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,
suppliers, distributors, partners, employees or regulators to the extent
primarily related thereto;

(E) any litigation arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or
violation of Law relating to this Agreement for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

(F) any decline in the market price, or change in trading volume, of any
capital stock or debt securities of the Company ( _provided_ that the
exception in this clause (F) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, event or occurrence underlying such decline has
resulted in or contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect);

 

(G) any change in the credit ratings of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
( _provided_ that the exception in this clause (G) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, event or occurrence
underlying such decline has resulted in or contributed to a Company Material
Adverse Effect);

 

(H) any failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts or
estimates of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position ( _provided_ that
the exception in this clause (H) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, event or occurrence underlying such failure has
resulted in or contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect); and

 



13 (I) any action taken by the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries that is
required by this Agreement or taken at the express written request or with the
express written consent of Parent or Merger Sub, or the failure to take any
action by the Company or its Subsidiaries if that action is not permitted or
is prohibited by this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, it being
understood that certain actions contemplated by the Companys Long Range Plan
are not permitted to be taken pursuant to Section 6.1 of this Agreement and no
change, event or occurrence arising out of or resulting from the failure of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take such actions shall constitute
or be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred);

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the changes set forth in clauses (A), (B) or
(C) above shall be taken into account in determining whether a "Company
Material Adverse Effect" has occurred to the extent (but only to such extent)
such changes have a materially disproportionate adverse impact on either (1)
the PLG Business, taken as a whole, or (2) the PSS Business, taken as a
whole, in each case, relative to the other participants in the principal
industries in which the PLG Business or the PSS Business, as the case may be,
conduct their businesses; and

 

(iii) " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person
of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having
by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 



14 (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
240,000,000 Shares and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _ _Preferred Shares__ "), of which, as of April 27, 2012,

5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list,
as of the date of this Agreement, of Company Stock Options outstanding under
the Stock Plans, including the holder, number of Shares and exercise price of
such Company Stock Options. As of April 27, 2012, other than 4,493,817 Shares

Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _ _Stock Plans__ ").
Upon the issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock

were subject to outstanding performance vested stock appreciation rights each
representing the right to receive Shares in accordance with the underlying
terms and conditions of such awards (such outstanding performance vested stock

any phantom stock appreciation units granted after April 27, 2012, the " _
_Phantom Stock Appreciation Units__ ") and 220,575 non-management director

Non-Management Directors. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim, option, right of first
refusal, voting restriction, or other encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). As
of the date hereof, one right (a " _ _Right__ ") under the Stockholder
Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of August 24, 2011, between the Company
and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the " _ _Rights Agreement__ "), is
associated with each Share, and under certain circumstances, as set forth in
the Rights Agreement, such Rights may be redeemed, may become exercisable for
securities or assets of the Company or securities of another entity, may be
exchanged for Shares or other securities or assets of the Company, may expire,
or may become null and void (including if they are "Beneficially Owned" by an
"Acquiring Person" or an Affiliate or Associate thereof, as such terms are

foregoing). Except as set forth in this Section 5.1(b)(i) and except for the
Rights, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, performance units,

authorized, issued or outstanding. Since April 27, 2012 through the date of
this Agreement, except for Shares issued in connection with the exercise of
Company Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding on April 27,
2012, no Shares have been issued and no Equity Awards have been granted by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



15 (ii) Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 

(iii) Except as set forth in Section 6.13 and the Voting Undertaking, there
are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and has taken all corporate action necessary to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject
only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting
duly called and held for such purpose (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ ").
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles (the " _ _Bankruptcy and Equity

its stockholders, (B) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (C) resolved,
subject to Section 6.2, to recommend that the holders of Shares adopt this
Agreement (such recommendation, the " _ _Company Recommendation__ "), and,

holders of Shares for their adoption. The Board of Directors of the Company
has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Perella Weinberg Partners
LP, dated the date hereof, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion, the Per
Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, as of the
date of such opinion, to the holders of Shares (other than any of the
Parent Affiliates, as defined therein). It is agreed and understood that such
opinion is for the benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company and may
not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

entity (each, a " _ _Governmental Entity__ ") in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except those that the failure to make or obtain, as the case may be, is not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impede the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger will not, constitute or result
in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of

5.1(d)(i), under any Law or Permit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B), for any such
breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that

Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impede the ability of the
Company to consummate the Merger.

 



17 (e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(i) Since January 29, 2010 (the " _ _Applicable Date__ "), the Company has
filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis (taking into account all
applicable grace periods) all forms, certifications, reports, statements and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act (such forms, certifications, reports,
statements and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and
those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including
any amendments thereto, the " _ _Company SEC Reports__ "). Each of the
Company SEC Reports (including any financial statements or other schedules
included therein), at the time of its filing or being furnished, complied or,
if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _ _Sarbanes-Oxley Act__ ") and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company SEC Reports. As
of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date of such amendment), the Company SEC Reports did not, and any
Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no
material outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect
to any of the Company SEC Reports.

 

(ii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company SEC
Reports. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _
_GAAP__ ").

the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2, the Guarantees,

the Company.

 

5.2. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Except as set
forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the Disclosure Letter
delivered to the Company by Parent prior to or simultaneously with entering
into this Agreement (the " _ _Parent Disclosure Letter__ ") (it being agreed

Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section
or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent),
Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the Company that: 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)

properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign
limited liability company, corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where any such failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified, in
good standing or to have such power or authority is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, the Carveout Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Carveout
Transaction Agreement. Parent has made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the certificate of formation, certificate of incorporation,

this Agreement, and each as so made available is in full force and effect.

 



32 (b) _Authority_. The Board of Managers of Parent and the Board of Directors of

transactions contemplated hereby. No vote of holders of capital stock of
Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger or the other

requisite corporate or similar power and authority and has taken all corporate
or similar action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement (other than adoption of this Agreement by
Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which adoption will occur
immediately following the execution of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.13(b)) and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due

of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the

Letter (the items set forth above in clauses (A) through (G), the " _ _Parent
Required Governmental Approvals__ "), no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained
by Parent or Merger Sub from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than such items that the failure to make or obtain, as
the case may be, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to prevent or materially impede the consummation of the Merger, the Carveout
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Carveout Transaction Agreement.

 



33 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each
of Parent and Merger Sub does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of Parent or Merger
Sub; (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation
of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any of their respective obligations under or the creation of
a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to any Contract
binding upon Parent or Merger Sub, or, assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.2(c)(i), under any Law to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject; or
(C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract
binding upon Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,
acceleration or change that is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the consummation
of the Merger, the Carveout Transaction or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Carveout Transaction Agreement.

 

(d) _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or
otherwise interfering with, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except those that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to prevent or materially impede the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, the Carveout Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Carveout Transaction
Agreement.

 



34 (e) _Financing; Available Funds_. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
complete and correct copies of (i) the commitment letters, each dated as of

", which term shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the
financial institutions providing the debt financing for the Carveout
Transaction) identified therein (the " _ _Debt Financing Commitments__ "),
pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein
for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including funding of the Exchange Fund) and related fees and expenses and the
refinancing of certain outstanding Indebtedness of the Company (the " _ _Debt
Financing__ "), and (ii) the equity commitment letters, each dated as of the
date hereof, from each of Blum and Golden Gate (the " _ _Equity Providers__
"), pursuant to which the Equity Providers have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest in Parent the cash amount
(the " _ _Equity Financing__ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _
_Financing__ ") set forth therein (the " _ _Equity Financing Commitments__ "
and, together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the " _ _Financing
Commitments__ "). None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or
modified prior to the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated and as of the date hereof, the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (complete copies of which
have been provided to the Company, with only fee and certain other terms

do not relate to any terms that would adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the
Debt Financing, as of the date of this Agreement there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than the Financing

with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and, as of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, the Carveout Purchaser or the Affiliates of
Parent and Merger Sub, in each case to the extent party thereto, as
applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other
parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 5.1 in all
material respects, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of the Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub party
thereto or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other party thereto
under any of the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 5.1(b)(i) (other than such inaccuracies as are _de minimis_ relative
to Section 5.1(b)(i) taken as a whole), Parent has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments will not be satisfied or the Financing will not be available at
the Closing. Assuming (w) the Financing Commitments are funded in accordance
with their terms (after giving effect to the flex provisions), (x) the

has delivered to the Company the Guarantees duly executed by the Guarantors
in favor of the Company. Each Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor party thereto,
enforceable against such Guarantor and no event has occurred, which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of any such Guarantor under the Guarantee to which it is a party.

 



35 (g) _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists
solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of
which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent free and clear of all Liens. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has any, and prior to the Effective Time will not have any,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those as may be
incident to their formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub does not
have outstanding any option, warrant, right or any other agreement
pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any equity
security of Merger Sub.

(h) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or

liability in a circumstance where the Merger is not consummated.

(i) _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" is, and at no time during the last three years
has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such quoted terms are

their "Affiliates" or "Associates" is, nor at any time during the last three
years has been, an "Interested Stockholder", as such quoted terms are defined
in Article TENTH of the Companys certificate of incorporation. As of the date
of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates,
including Wolverine, Blum and Golden Gate beneficially own (as used in this
Agreement, " _ _beneficial ownership__ " means beneficial ownership as
determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) the
Shares set forth on Section 5.2(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _
_Parent Shares__ "). As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub "owns" any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the
Parent Shares, as such quoted term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. 

(j) _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case,
whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any

its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (other than pursuant to any
employment Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement), (y)
contribute or rollover any portion of such employees Shares, Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock and/or Phantom Stock Units to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Affiliates or (z) receive
any capital stock or equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 



36 (k) _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 5.1(e), (ii) the accuracy of
the financial information provided to Parent by the Company prior to the date
hereof and (iii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to
consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing,
any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in
this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, payment of all amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Carveout
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Carveout Transaction Agreement, and payment of all related fees and expenses,
each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Merger, the
Carveout Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Carveout Transaction Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _ _Solvent__ ", when used with respect to any Person, means that,
as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value"
of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (i) the
value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be
able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due. 

(l) _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective business or operations, including with respect to any information
provided, disclosed or delivered to Parent or Merger Sub. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, nor any other Person, will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person, or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Person, of any such information provided or made available to them
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, including any information, documents,
estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking information,
business plans, cost-related plans or other material provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person in certain "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda, management presentations or due diligence
discussions in anticipation or contemplation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



37 (m) _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations,
including with respect to any information provided, disclosed, delivered or
made available to Parent or Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans and cost-related plans, with which Parent and
Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements,
business plans or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements, business plans or cost-related plans).

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

(i) The Company agrees that, except as expressly permitted by this Section
6.2, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and
directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall instruct and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,

_ _Representatives__ ") not to, directly or indirectly: 

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal;

Representatives to, cease immediately any discussions or negotiations, if any,
with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective

the Company and its Representatives may (A) contact such Person to clarify

public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries) in response to
a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from such Person an

in any material respect than the terms contained in any of the Confidentiality
Agreements ( _it being understood_  that such confidentiality agreement need
not prohibit the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal to the extent
such Acquisition Proposal is made directly to the Company); _provided_ that

Subsidiaries that the Company made available to any Person given such access
which was not previously made available to Parent; (C) engage or participate

Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that such action could
be required by the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in
each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof has determined in good faith based on
the information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (D) above, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 



44 (b) For the purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (A) any proposal or offer with respect
to a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization or similar transaction involving the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) any acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal or
offer to acquire by tender offer, share exchange, stock or asset purchase or
in any other manner, which if consummated would result in any Person or group
of Persons becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or
a series of related transactions, (1) 15% or more of the total voting power
or of any class of equity securities of the Company or (2) 15% or more of the
consolidated total assets measured by fair market value (including equity
securities of its Subsidiaries), of the Company.

(ii) " _ _Superior Proposal__ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with
the percentages set forth in the definition of such term in subsections
(B)(1) and (B)(2) thereof changed from 15% to 75% that the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof has determined in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms), and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of clauses (A) and
(B), after taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person making the proposal (including the financing
thereof).

(c) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.

(i) The Board of Directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall
not:

 

(A) (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or (ii) approve, recommend
or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise), any Acquisition Proposal ( _it being
understood_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may take no position
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business as of the
10th Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being
considered an adverse modification); or

(B) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a)(ii)) (an " _ _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



45 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may
(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or (B)
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines
in good faith is a Superior Proposal made after the date of this Agreement, in
the case of clauses (A) and (B), if the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that such action could be required by the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (any action described in clauses (A)
and (B), a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ "), and thereafter may also take
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal or take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless and until (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing,
at least three Business Days in advance, that the Companys Board of
Directors intends to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to
a Superior Proposal, in either case subject only to compliance with this
proviso, which notice shall specify the identity of the party who made such
Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and shall attach the agreement and all material
related documentation providing for such Superior Proposal; (y) after
providing such notice and prior to making such Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or taking any action pursuant to Section
8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent during such three Business Day period (to the extent
that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantees as would permit the
Board of Directors of the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or to take such action pursuant to Section
8.3(a) in response to a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement,
the Financing Commitments and the Guarantees offered in writing by Parent in a
manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and
shall have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were to be given effect; _provided_ that in the event the
Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section 6.2(c),
except that the Companys advance written notice obligation shall be reduced
to two Business Days (rather than the three Business Days otherwise
contemplated by this Section 6.2(c)) and the time the Company shall be
permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal shall be reduced to the time that is two Business Days after it has
provided such written notice (rather than the time that is the three Business
Days otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.2(c)). 

 



46 (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
United States federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders), (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company) or (iii) making accurate disclosure to the
Companys stockholders of any factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of
the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof shall not make a Change of Recommendation
except in accordance with Section 6.2(c).

 

(e) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice,
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal
or seeking such information or discussions or negotiations and including a
written summary of the material terms and conditions of any requests,
proposals, offers constituting Acquisition Proposals that are not made in
writing and copies of any written requests, proposals or offers constituting
Acquisition Proposals, including proposed agreements that are made in
writing, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours with respect to a change in price
and within 48 hours in the case of any other change) of the terms of any such
modification (including any amendments thereto or any change to the scope,
terms or conditions thereof) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations relating thereto. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries will enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

practicable after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file in preliminary
form the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company agrees that as of the date

applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (b) none of the information supplied by it or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy

_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone

(a) with the consent of Parent; (b) for the absence of a quorum; (c) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental

information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested. All requests for information made pursuant to this

permit any access, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result in any violation of
any Law or any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or
cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that the Company or
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in the Companys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect the Companys position in
any pending or, what the Company believes in good faith (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation, (ii) if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,

in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
disclosure; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of
the Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel))
be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such Law or Contract or
be reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be
managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to
which non-employee Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such
information.

 



52 (c) The information provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be used solely
for the purpose of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby

Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (" _
_Affected Employees__ ") will be provided with (A) base salary and annual and
long-term cash bonus opportunities which are no less than the base salary and
annual and long-term cash bonus opportunities provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to each such Affected Employee immediately prior to the

the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Affected Employee under the
Company Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (C)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits

53 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent
(collectively, " _ _Parent Benefit Plans__ ") which the Affected Employees
are entitled to participate in as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Parent Benefit Plans to take into account for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards) and for purposes of
determining amounts of severance, or future vacation or other paid time off
accrual (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any qualified defined
benefit pension plan) thereunder, service for the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service). In the event of any
change in the welfare benefits provided to Affected Employee following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage

plan in which an Affected Employee is eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for any co-payments,
deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Effective Time
under the terms of any corresponding Company Plan in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs under any welfare benefit plan in which the
Affected Employee participates on and after the Effective Time.

(c) Parent agrees that for the year in which the Effective Time occurs, it
shall provide Annual Incentive Plan cash bonus opportunities that are not less
than the threshold, target and maximum annual cash bonus opportunities in
effect as of the Effective Time and performance metrics relative to such
opportunities that are substantially comparable to the existing Annual
Incentive Program performance metrics as reasonably adjusted in good faith
following the Effective Time to reflect changes in corporate structure, the
Merger or the Carveout Transaction.

(d) Parent agrees that following the Effective Time, it shall provide long-
term incentive performance-based cash program (the " _ _LTIP__ ")
opportunities in respect of outstanding LTIP award cycles that are not less
than the threshold, target and maximum LTIP opportunities as in effect as of
the Effective Time and performance metrics relative to such opportunities
that are substantially comparable to the existing LTIP performance metrics as
reasonably adjusted in good faith following the Effective Time to reflect
changes to corporate structure, the Merger or the Carveout Transaction. 

 



54 (e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change
of control" within the meaning of each Company Plan that contains such terms
will occur upon the Effective Time.

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor
thereto to honor, assume, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its
Subsidiaries obligations under the plans, policies and agreements identified
in Section 6.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their
terms as well as the terms set forth on Section 6.9(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(g) Parent hereby acknowledges and recognizes that, as of the Effective Time,

the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to future bargaining between the
unions and the Company or the Companys Affiliates).

(h) For purposes of Section 6.9 (other than 6.9(e)), each reference to
"Parent" shall be deemed to also be a reference to "Wolverine" and each
reference to Parent shall also be a reference to the Subsidiary of Wolverine
that is party to the Carveout Transaction Agreement to the extent applicable
with respect to the PLG Business in connection with the Carveout Transaction.

(i) The parties agree that all provisions in this Section 6.9 are included
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) constitute an amendment to
any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Plan or any other applicable employee
benefit arrangement, (ii) create any third party beneficiary rights (x) in any
other Person, or (y) to continued employment with Parent, Company or any of
their Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (iii) shall alter or limit Parents, the
Companys or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries ability to amend,
modify or terminate, in accordance with the terms of such plan, any particular
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 8.5,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except expenses incurred in connection with Parents indemnification
and reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(c) and Section 6.19.

 



55 6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving

director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_ _Indemnified Parties__ ") against any costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to
such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the Person to whom Costs are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such Costs if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the
extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies for the
Indemnified Parties, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary and employment
practices liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _ _D andO Insurance__") with benefits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies with respect to any
matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ that the cost of the annual premium amount for such
"tail" insurance policies does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 



56 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11.

addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

6.12. _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent
and their respective Boards of Directors shall each use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement.

6.13. _Parent Vote_.

 

(a) Parent and Wolverine shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to
be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Parent Shares in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of the
Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at all
adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action
of stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a meeting), subject to
the limitations set forth in the Voting Undertaking.

appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or assert any rights to
dissent or otherwise in connection with the Merger with respect to any and all
Parent Shares.

 



58 6.14. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent, and, solely with regard to the debt financing for the Carveout
Transaction (the " _Carveout Financing_ "), the Carveout Purchaser shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) described in the Financing Commitments and
shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments if such
amendment, modification or waiver would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing or (y) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent to the receipt of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or
prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitments
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Sub and, solely with regard to
the Carveout Financing, the Carveout Purchaser may replace or amend the Debt
Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement). Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and, solely with regard to the Carveout Financing, the Carveout
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Financing Commitments (including by consummating the financing pursuant to the
terms of the Equity Financing Commitments) until the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and, solely with
regard to the Carveout Financing, the Carveout Purchaser in the

Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (iv) upon satisfaction of the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, consummate the Financing at
Closing, and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and,
solely with regard to the Carveout Financing, the Carveout Purchaser shall
give the Company prompt notice (which shall in no event be more than two
Business Days from their knowledge thereof): (A) of any material breach or
material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach
or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document
related to the Financing; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any: (1) breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment
or any definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of the
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or
(2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive agreement with respect
thereto); and (C) if Parent or Merger Sub will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the definitive documents related
to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
two Business Days after the date the Company delivers Parent, Merger Sub or,
solely with regard to the Carveout Financing, the Carveout Purchaser a written
request, Parent, Merger Sub or, solely with regard to the Carveout Financing,
the Carveout Purchaser, shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C)
of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_  that in no event will
Parent, Merger Sub or, solely with regard to the Carveout Financing, the
Carveout Purchaser be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent, Merger Sub
or, solely with regard to the Carveout Financing, the Carveout Purchaser
shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way
that would not waive such privilege. If any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions
contained in the Redacted Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments, Parent or, solely with regard to the Carveout Financing, the
Carveout Purchaser shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
terms not materially less favorable from the standpoint of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company than those in the Financing Commitments (taking into
account the flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date. Parent or, solely with regard to the Carveout Financing,
the Carveout Purchaser shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete
copy of each alternative financing commitment (together with a redacted copy
of any related fee letter) to the Company. The Carveout Purchaser represents
and warrants that (i) the "Purchase Documentation" (other than this Agreement
and the Carveout Transaction Agreement, a full and complete copy of which has
been provided to the Company on the date hereof) referred to in paragraph 4
of Exhibit D of the Commitment Letter, dated the date hereof (the " _
_Carveout Purchaser Commitment Letter__ "), among the Carveout Purchaser and
the financing sources party thereto, does not contain any conditions to the
Closing or to the closing of either the Carveout Financing or the Carveout
Transaction that are additional to or different from the conditions set forth
in the Carveout Transaction Agreement, and that the terms thereof are
not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) the terms of and
performance by the parties of their obligations under such Purchase
Documentation would not reasonably be expected to delay, prevent, hinder or
impede the Closing or the closing of either the Carveout Financing or the
Carveout Transaction. Parent, Merger Sub and the Carveout Purchaser agree that
they will not amend or modify any such "Purchase Documentation" (a) to add new
or additional conditions or amend, modify or expand the existing conditions
or (b) otherwise in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay,
prevent, hinder or impede the Closing or the closing of either the Carveout
Financing or the Carveout Transaction. 

 



59 (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Financing
Commitments and shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Equity Financing Commitments until the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated and (ii) subject to Section 9.5(c), enforce
their rights under the Equity Financing Commitments.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, provide to Parent and the Carveout Purchaser, at the
Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and the
Carveout Purchaser in connection with the arrangement and consummation of the
Financing (including the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth
therein) and any alternative financing as set forth in Section 6.14(a),
including, without limitation (in each case, to the extent reasonably
requested):

(i) participating in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions between senior management and
prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies;

memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing (including customary authorization and
management representation letters) and all documentation and other information
required in connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001;

(iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or
interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Carveout
Purchaser (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company with respect to solvency matters for
the PSS Business on a consolidated basis in a customary form), and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing), and any documents requested by Parent or Carveout Purchaser in
connection with the preparation of Intellectual Property schedules, including
with respect to items of Intellectual Property not included in the Material
Company Intellectual Property) or otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral;

 



60 (iv) (A) furnishing Parent, the Carveout Purchaser and the Financing
Sources as promptly as practicable with (x) audited consolidated balance
sheets and related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows

PSS Business and (3) the Company, for each fiscal quarter ended after the
date hereof but at least 40 days before the Closing Date; (B) furnishing to
Parent, the Carveout Purchaser and the Financing Sources, not later than 20
business days prior to the Closing Date, with all audited and unaudited
financial statements, business and other financial data, audit reports and
other information regarding the PLG Business and the PSS Business of the type
customarily included in offering memoranda for private placements pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act (other than (i) separate financial
statements and footnote disclosures with respect to guarantors and non-
guarantors and non-guarantors and required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act and (ii) separate financial statements with respect
to subsidiaries pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act), to consummate a Rule 144A offering of senior notes pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitments (provided that Parent shall be responsible for the
preparation of pro forma financial statements), and such information shall be
of the type and form that would be necessary for the investment banks to
receive from the PLG Business and the PSS Business independent
accountants customary (for high yield debt securities) "comfort" (including
"negative assurance" comfort) with respect to the financial information to be
included in such offering documents and other pertinent information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the PLG
Business and the PSS Business) as may be reasonably requested in writing by
Parent or the Carveout Purchaser and identifying any portion of such
information that constitutes material non-public information; and (C)
furnishing to Parent, the Carveout Purchaser and the Financing Sources
information required in connection with confidential information memoranda and
the Lenders presentation in respect of the Debt Financing Facilities, in
each case customarily used for the syndication of the Debt Financing or the
alternative financing transactions to Parent, the Carveout Purchaser and the
Financing Sources; it being understood that all such information, to the
extent based upon assumptions relating to the separation and carveout of the
PLG Business and the PSS Business, shall be prepared as contemplated by
Section 6.14(e)(iii) (all such information in this clause (iv), the " _
_Required Financial Information__ ");

(v) providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) of
the Company to the extent the Company customarily prepares such financial
statements;

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining accountants
comfort letters, consents, surveys, legal opinions from local outside counsel
(and not internal counsel or New York or Delaware counsel) and title insurance
as reasonably requested by Parent or the Carveout Purchaser for financings
similar to the Financing; and

(vii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective
lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including the PLG Business and the PSS Business) current

relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements, (B)
establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing and (C) permit representatives
of the prospective lenders to conduct commercial field examinations, inventory
appraisals and an appraisal of the owned real estate, and use commercially

Financing.

 



61 Nothing in this Section 6.14(c) shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required pursuant to this Section 6.14(c) to enter into or perform under
any certificate, agreement, document or other instrument that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective
Time (other than the authorization letters and representation letters referred
to in clause (ii) above). None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 6.14(c) that
would subject it to actual or potential liability for which it would not be
indemnified hereunder or to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-
pocket costs) or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with
the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.14(c))
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including
the PLG Business and the PSS Business) provided by the Company in writing
specifically for use in the Financing offering documents). Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Section 6.14(c). The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not
intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII. In addition, the completion of the
issuance of the senior notes pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitments is not
a condition to Closing. In the event that all or any portion of the Debt
Financing to be obtained through the issuance of the senior note as
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments has not been obtained on or
prior to the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause,
no later than the Closing, the bridge facility to be drawn and the proceeds
of the bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments to be
used to replace such portion of the senior notes not issued at Closing

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement,

 



62 (i) the term " _ _Marketing Period__ " shall mean the first period of 17
consecutive Business Days throughout which (i) Parent shall have all of the
Required Financial Information regarding the PSS Business and the Company and
the Carveout Purchaser shall have all of the Required Financial
Information regarding the PLG Business and the Company, (ii) the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing) and
nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied, assuming that the
Closing Date were to be scheduled for any time during such 17 consecutive
Business Day period; _provided_ that the Marketing Period will not be deemed
to commence if prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, (A) the
Companys auditors shall have withdrawn their audit opinion contained in the
Required Financial Information or (B) the financial statements included in
the Required Financial Information that is available to Parent and the
Carveout Purchaser, as applicable, on the first day of any such 17 consecutive
Business Day period would be required to be updated under Rule 3-12 of
Regulation S-X in order to be sufficiently current on any day during such 17
consecutive Business Day period to permit a registration statement using such
financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of
such 17 consecutive Business Day period, in which case the Marketing Period
shall not be deemed to commence until the receipt by Parent and the Carveout
Purchaser, as applicable, of updated financial statements that would be
required under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement
using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the
last day of such new 17 consecutive Business Day period; _provided_ that the
Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which all
of the Debt Financing or any alternative financing as set forth in Section
6.14(a) is obtained; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such 17 consecutive
Business Day period has not ended on or prior to August 20, 2012, then it
shall not commence until September 4, 2012; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has delivered the
applicable Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent and the
Carveout Purchaser written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it
completed such delivery), in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed
to have commenced on the date specified in that notice unless Parent or
the Carveout Purchaser in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not
completed delivery of the Required Financial Information and, within two
Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a
written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with reasonable
specificity which Required Financial Information Parent or the Carveout
Purchaser, as applicable, reasonably believes the Company has not delivered);

 

(ii) the term " _ _PSS Business__ " means the business, operations, assets and
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation that would remain after giving
effect to the Carveout Transaction; and

(iii) if Parent does not deliver all assumptions reasonably necessary for use
in connection with the production of the financial statements, business and
other financial data, audit reports and other information for the PLG Business
and PSS Business included within the definition of "Required Financial
Information" within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof (the " _
_Assumption Period__ "), the Company shall be permitted to make in good faith
any and all assumptions that it determines are reasonably necessary in order
to produce such Required Financial Information (it being understood that the
Company shall consider any assumptions provided by Parent after the Assumption
Period and shall use such assumptions unless the Company determines that such
assumptions would cause a material delay in the preparation of the Required
Financial Information or would be factually incorrect).

 



63 6.15. _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a certificate, signed under penalty of perjury and in form and
substance as required by Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the
Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code certifying that an interest in
the Company is not a United States real property interest under Section
897(c) of the Code.

6.16. _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (" _ _Transaction Litigation__ ") is brought, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, against the Company and/or
the members of the Board of Directors of the Company after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall not settle or agree to settle
any Transaction Litigation, without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

6.17.  _Carveout Transaction Matters_. If requested by Parent, at Parents
sole expense, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and
Merger Sub so that the closing of the Carveout Transaction and the Closing
contemplated by this Agreement can occur and be effected concurrently and,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall refrain from taking actions to effect any
internal reorganization to implement the Carveout Transaction without the
prior written consent of Parent. Wolverine shall cooperate with Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company in connection with and use reasonable best efforts
and shall cause its Affiliates (other than Parent) to so cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts, to cause the closing of the Carveout Transaction to
occur concurrently with the Closing; _provided_ that this Section 6.17 shall
not require the Company to take any corporate action, to execute any document
or other instrument, or to incur any liability that is not conditioned upon
or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time.

6.18. _Credit Agreement Matters_. If requested by Parent, the Company shall
provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in arranging for, at
the Closing the termination of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Companys
$725,000,000 Term Loan Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2007, among the
Company, the Lenders party thereto, Citicorp North America Inc., Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the " _ _Term Loan
Agreement__ "), and the Companys 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013
(the " _ _Senior Subordinated Notes__ "), and any other existing indebtedness
of the Company and its subsidiaries and the procurement of customary payoff
letters in connection therewith; _provided_ that in no event shall this
Section 6.18 require the Company to cause the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Term Loan Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Notes or any other existing
indebtedness to be terminated unless (a) the Company has received from Parent
or Carveout Purchaser funds to pay in full the payoff amount for any such
indebtedness and (b) Parent or Carveout Purchaser has agreed to and has
provided backstop letters of credit or cash collateralized any existing
letters of credit and guarantees and hedging arrangements and other bank
products thereunder in a manner satisfactory to the lenders or holders of such
indebtedness, to the extent applicable.

 



64 6.19. _Repatriation_. Parent may request in writing to the Company (the " _
_Repatriation Notice__ ") that the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries
cooperate to transfer in the jurisdictions listed in Section 6.19 of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ _Repatriation Jurisdictions__ ")
unrestricted cash balances held in commercial bank accounts in the name of the
Company or such wholly owned Subsidiary (the " _ _Repatriation__ ") on or
shortly prior to Closing. Parent may periodically request from the Company,
and the Company will provide (but not more often than monthly), an estimate of
the amount of cash that it believes could be Repatriated by the Company as of
a Closing Date estimated by Parent, understanding that such amounts are only
an estimate and actual amounts may vary from such estimates. The Repatriation
Notice shall specify the Repatriation Jurisdictions that Parent would like the
Company to Repatriate cash from and Parents good faith estimate of the
Closing Date. The Company will review the Repatriation Notice and within five
(5) Business Days after the receipt thereof, send to Parent in writing with
respect each Repatriation Jurisdiction the following information (the " _
_Repatriation Response__ "): (a) the amount of cash in each Repatriation
Jurisdiction that the Company would agree to Repatriate, taking into account
(i) Parents estimate of the Closing Date, (ii) the amount of cash reasonably
needed in such Repatriation Jurisdiction to operate the business in the
ordinary course and meet working capital requirements in such Repatriation
Jurisdiction, (iii) applicable Law, including those relating to
solvency, adequate surplus, similar capital adequacy tests, corporate
benefit, financial assistance, distributable reserves and directors duties,
and (iv) any estimated Taxes or fees and expenses to be paid in such
Repatriation Jurisdiction in connection with the Repatriation, (b) the
estimated costs and expenses to be incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Repatriation, including estimated Taxes to
be paid on such Repatriated amount and the fees and expenses of counsel and
accountants in connection with the Repatriation (collectively, the " _
_Estimated Costs__ ") and (c) the amount of time that the Company estimates it
will take for the Repatriation to be completed in each such Repatriation
Jurisdiction identified in the Repatriation Notice. The Company shall not
unreasonably deny a request for repatriation set forth in a Repatriation
Notice. Within five (5) Business Days following delivery of the Repatriation
Response, Parent shall notify the Company in writing whether or not Parent
consents to each Repatriation set forth in the Repatriation Response
(including Repatriation of the amounts set forth therein, subject to increases
or decreases of such amounts by the Company as may be reasonable at the time
of Repatriation based on the amount of unrestricted cash actually available at
such time) (the " _ _Repatriation Confirmation__ ") and if it consents to a
Repatriation, confirming with respect to each Repatriation to which it
consents, (a) that it approves of the Company and its Subsidiaries taking the
actions reasonably necessary in the Companys sole judgment to effect such
Repatriation and (b) that it approves of the Company incurring the Estimated
Costs (and any additional amounts as may be reasonably incurred in connection
with the Repatriation). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments, Taxes (including loss of tax attributes) and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the Repatriation, including any action
taken in accordance with this Section 6.19 and including the Estimated Costs.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all Estimated Costs (and additional costs) actually incurred by the Company
or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.19.

the Company Disclosure Letter for a period of 5 Business Days after the date

administrative sanctions or that any of their Representatives would be subject
to risk of criminal sanctions or material civil or administrative sanctions.

 

(c) _No Injunction_. No Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) by

reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (iii) Parent

since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Company
Material Adverse Effect that remains in effect.

to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior
to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and warranties

such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of

to use the standard of efforts required from such party to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as
required by and subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.14.

referred to in sub-clause (i)(z) of this Section 8.5(b), (B) in the case of
clause (ii) of this Section 8.5(b), no later than three Business Days after
the date of such termination and (C) in the case of clause (iii) of this
Section 8.5(b), immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination, pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds ( _it being understood_ that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion). " _ _Termination Fee__ " shall mean an amount equal to
$44,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have the right to assign
the right to receive the Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole
discretion.

 

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
by (i) the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) (the section relating to
material breach by Parent or Merger Sub) and the breach by Parent or Merger
Sub giving rise to such termination is the principal cause of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated, in such case, unless, prior to
such termination, (A) Parent and Merger Sub deliver written notice at least
two (2) Business Days in advance of the Breach End Date informing the Company
that Parent and Merger Sub would be ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger in accordance with its terms no later than the Breach End Date and (B)
Parent and Merger Sub stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger
in accordance with its terms on the Breach End Date, (ii) the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(c) (the section relating to failure to consummate on the
Closing Date specified by Section 1.2), (iii) Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(b) (the section relating to material breach by the Company) if (x) a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred and (y) no termination right
would have existed thereunder if each reference to "Company Material Adverse
Effect" in this Agreement (other than the references thereto in Section
5.1(a)(ii), Section 5.1(f) and this Section 8.5(c)) had been replaced with a
reference to "Whole Company Material Adverse Effect" or (iv) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (the section relating to the
Termination Date), if (x) a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred and
(y) at the time of termination, all of the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 would have been satisfied (including Section 7.2(a) but other than
other conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at the
Closing, all of which are capable of being satisfied at the closing) if each
reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect" in this Agreement (other than
the references thereto in Section 5.1(a)(ii), Section 5.1(f) and this Section
8.5(c)) had been replaced with references to "Whole Company Material Adverse
Effect", then Parent shall, no later than three Business Days after the date
of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company (I) in the case
of clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 8.5(c), the Parent Termination
Fee and (II) in the case of clause (iii) or clause (iv) of this Section
8.5(c), the amount of the Company Expenses, in each case, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds ( _it being understood_ that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Expenses
on more than one occasion or both the Parent Termination Fee and the Company
Expenses). " _ _Parent Termination Fee__ " shall mean an amount equal to
$84,000,000. For purposes of this Agreement, "Whole Company Material
Adverse Effect" means a Company Material Adverse Effect, except that, solely
for purposes of this definition, (i) each reference to "either (1) the PLG
Business, taken as a whole, or (2) the PSS Business, taken as a whole"
set forth in the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be
deemed to be replaced with "the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole" and (ii) each reference to "the PLG Business or the PSS Business" set
forth in the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to
be a replaced with "the Company and its Subsidiaries". " _ _Company Expenses__
" means, without duplication of any fees or expenses previously paid
by Parent, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses but excluding any
financial advisor fees) actually incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries
between the date of this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement in
connection with the Companys compliance with the covenants set forth in this
Agreement in furtherance of the Merger or the Carveout Transaction (and not
including any fees or expenses incurred in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal). From time to time following the date hereof (but no more frequently
than every twenty (20) Business Days), the Company shall provide promptly all
information and documentation reasonably requested by Parent to evidence the
Company Expenses incurred as of such date and the amount thereof.

 



71 (d) _Parent Expenses_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (the section relating to a
failure to receive stockholder approval) or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(b) (the section relating to a material breach by the Company) as a result
of a material breach by the Company of this Agreement that is a consequence
of an act or failure to act by the Company with the Company having actual
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause
a breach of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Termination Fee
is not then payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b), then the Company shall,
following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in any event within three
Business Days) pay all of Parents and its Affiliates reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the " _ _Parent
Expenses__ "), which amount shall in no event exceed $12,500,000 in the
aggregate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated by Parent or its designee; _provided_ that the
existence of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.5(b) shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to
this Section 8.5(d); _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the Company
of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(d) shall not relieve the
Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.5(b), but shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Company
Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under Section 8.5(b). For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have right to assign the right to receive
the Parent Expenses to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.

 



72 (e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(d) or Parent fails to promptly pay
the amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(d) or any portion thereof
or a judgment against Parent for the amounts set forth in Section 8.5(c) or
any portion thereof, the Company shall reimburse Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective designees, on the one hand, or Parent shall reimburse or
cause the Company to be reimbursed, on the other hand, such partys costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(i) the Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5 (its rights to enforce the Guarantees
with respect thereto and in the case the Parent Termination Fee is not timely
paid the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(e)), any
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Sections
6.14(c) or 6.19 and the Companys right to specific performance of
this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.5(c) and 9.5(d) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub,
Wolverine, the Equity Providers, the Financing Sources under the Debt
Financing Commitments, any of their respective Affiliates, and any of the
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, managers, members or agents of any of the
foregoing, for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
and upon payment of such amounts, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Wolverine, the
Equity Providers, the Financing Sources under the Debt Financing
Commitments, any of their respective Affiliates, and any of the former,
current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, managers, employees, members or agents of any of the foregoing,
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
Parents receipt of the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, as the case
may be, from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5 (plus, in the case the
Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses are not timely paid, the amounts
described in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(e)) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates
against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates or agents for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of
such amounts, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates or agents shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent such court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware (the " _ _Chosen Courts__ ") solely in respect
of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and
of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The parties
hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over the person
of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter
of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 9.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid,
effective and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not, and will not permit its
Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
lenders, agents or arrangers under the Financing Commitments and their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns and any other debt financing
sources (collectively, the " _ _Lender Related Parties__ ") in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Carveout Transaction Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including with respect to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitments, the Financing, the debt commitments relating to the Carveout
Transaction, the financing of the Carveout Transaction or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than any state or Federal court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and agree that the waiver of jury
trial set forth in Section 9.5(b) hereof shall be applicable to any such
proceeding.

 



74 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE CARVEOUT TRANSACTION AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy, subject to Section 9.5(d), to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and
agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and
to prevent or cure breaches of Sections 6.5 and 6.14 by Wolverine, Parent or
Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of the Carveout Transaction Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of the Carveout Transaction Agreement,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at
law or in equity. Each of Wolverine, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (x) the Company has an adequate remedy at
law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



75 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the
provisions of Section 9.5(c), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and to effect the Merger in
accordance with Section 1.2 in the event that, but only in the event that,
(i) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that
by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which
shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied
or waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred, (ii) the Debt
Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used pursuant to Section
6.14(a), pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2 will occur. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce
or seek to enforce specifically the obligation to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing or the
alternative financing as set forth in Section 6.14(a) pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto has not been funded (or will not be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). Under no
circumstance shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and
the Merger to be consummated that results in the Closing and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) under no circumstances
will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of (1) any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 8.5(c), (2) any reimbursement obligation of
Parent pursuant to the first sentence of Section 8.5(e) and (3) the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent contained in Sections
6.14 and 6.19 and (B) under no circumstances will Parent be entitled to
monetary damages in excess of (1) the amount of the Termination Fee and (2)
any reimbursement obligations of the Company pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 8.5(e).

thereof; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with their terms,
except that the restrictions on prohibited discussions or arrangements and
the standstill restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate
immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR

provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may

unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
disclosure letter (each, a " _ _Disclosure Letter__ ") in a section thereof
that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The
mere inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of any partys
Disclosure Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty or
otherwise shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute an admission by
the applicable party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
otherwise represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance for
the purposes of this Agreement, or that such item meets or exceeds a monetary
or other threshold specified for disclosure in this Agreement. Matters
disclosed in any section or subsection of a partys Disclosure Letter are not
necessarily limited to matters that are required by this Agreement to be
disclosed therein. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
nature or impose any duty or obligation to disclose any information beyond
what is required by this Agreement, and disclosure of such additional matters
shall not affect, directly or indirectly, the interpretation of
this Agreement or the scope of the disclosure obligations hereunder. Headings
inserted in the sections or subsections of any partys Disclosure Letter are
for convenience of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or
changing the express terms of the sections or subsections as set forth in
this Agreement.

 



81 9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of
such designation; provided that any such designation shall not impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
is void.
