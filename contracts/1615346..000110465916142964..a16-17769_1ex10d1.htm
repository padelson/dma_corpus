treated as a contribution in exchange for a partnership interest in a
transaction consistent with the requirements of Section 721(a) of the Code.
Fund G and the Partnership further intend that the Tax Consideration shall be
treated to the maximum extent possible as a reimbursement of capital
expenditures described in Section 1.707-4(d) of the Treasury regulations. If
the Tax Consideration exceeds the amount that can be treated as a
reimbursement of capital expenditures under Treasury regulations Section

regulations.

can be treated as a reimbursement of capital expenditures under Treasury

Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law, as appropriate) (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall

disputes relating to the Allocation. If the consideration is adjusted pursuant
to any provision of this Agreement, the Allocation will reflect such
adjustment as mutually agreed by Fund G and the Partnership. Fund G and the
Partnership shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, IRS
Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation. Neither Fund G nor the Partnership
shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such Allocation and neither Fund
G nor the Partnership shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the Allocation
by any Taxing authority without first giving the other Party prior written
notice; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Fund G
or the Partnership from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Taxing authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither Fund
G nor the Partnership shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority challenging such
Allocation.

to any Asset), or (iii) would require the consent, authorization, approval or
waiver of a Person who is not a party to this Agreement, and such consent,
authorization, approval or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the

or delivery, thereof; _provided_ , however, that, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions contained in _Article 10_ and _Article 11_, the
Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to
the Purchase Price on account thereof. Following the Closing, Landmark and
OpCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each
other, to obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval or waiver.

cannot be transferred to OpCo at the Closing or any transfer is later voided
or diminished due to a cause of the type described in clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) of the first sentence of this _Section 2.5_, Landmark and OpCo shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such arrangements to provide
to the parties the economic and operational equivalent of the transfer of such
Asset or Assumed Liability to OpCo as of the Closing and the performance by
OpCo and Landmark of their respective obligations with respect thereto.

9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. A Fund G Indemnitee or Partnership
Indemnitee, as the case may be (for purposes of this _Section 9.4_, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), shall give the indemnifying party under _Section 9.1_
or _Section 9.2_, as applicable (for purposes of this _Section 9.4_, an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), prompt written notice of any matter which it has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Agreement, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such

 



      
 

 



 

right of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ , however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
its obligations under this _Article 9_ except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure. In connection with any claim giving rise
to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any Action by a Person
who is not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost
and expense and upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, may assume the
defense of any such Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of any such Action, with its counsel and at its own cost and
expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such
Action, the Indemnified Party may, but shall not be obligated to, defend
against such Action in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but
not limited to, settling such Action, after giving notice of it to the
Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem
appropriate and no action taken by the Indemnified Party in accordance with
such defense and settlement shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations herein provided with respect to any damages
resulting therefrom. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Action
without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

contemplated by this Agreement illegal or of prohibiting or otherwise
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (ii) issued or entered any order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and has the effect of making the consummation of

otherwise preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) By the Partnership if there has been an event, change, occurrence or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with any other events,
changes, occurrences or circumstances, has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Membership Interest.

2016 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that such right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 12.1(d)_ shall not be available to the
Partnership if the Partnership has materially breached its obligations under
this Agreement in a manner that shall have proximately contributed to the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) By Fund G if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Outside Date;
provided that such right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

Fund G contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or Fund G
shall at any time have failed to perform and comply with all agreements and
covenants of Fund G contained in this Agreement requiring performance or

Partnership contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or
the Partnership shall at any time have failed to perform and comply with all
agreements and covenants of the Partnership contained in this Agreement

of cure, shall not have been cured within 10 days of the receipt of written
notice thereof by the Partnership from Fund G or, if earlier, the Outside

terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination from time to
time to Fund G specifying the basis for the Partnerships termination. Fund G

or Fund G to any Person in respect of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the covenants and agreements contained in _Article 14_ and in this _Section
12.3_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ ,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no such termination shall
relieve any Party of any liability resulting from any breach of this Agreement
prior to the time of such termination.

10_ and _Article 11_, the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall occur on August 30, 2016 or, if all of the conditions set
forth in _Article 10_ and _Article 11_ are not satisfied or waived by such
date, such other date as the Parties may agree (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

13.2 At the Closing, Fund G shall deliver to the Partnership:

Assignment Agreements, as necessary to vest all right, title and interest of
Fund G in and to the Membership Interest to the Partnership;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) all necessary forms and certificates complying with applicable Law, duly
executed and acknowledged, certifying that the transactions contemplated
hereby are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code and any
state or local equivalent thereof;

 



 

(c) copies of documents, including all leases, grants of easements and non-
disturbance agreements relating to the Assets, including any amendments,
guarantees or other documents relating thereto;

 



 

(d) a settlement statement mutually approved by the Parties;

 



 

(e) the executed counterpart to the Credit Facility Amendment Agreement and
other ancillary agreements thereto;

 



 

(f) an executed payoff letter from the administrative agent under the Fund G

statements; and

 



 

(g) each other document or instrument specified in or as may be reasonably
required by this Agreement.

 



 

13.3 At Closing, the Partnership shall deliver to Fund G:

 



 

(a) the Units (other than the Reserved Units) in book-entry form;

 



 

(b) the Cash Consideration, in immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by Fund G;

 



 

(c) the executed counterpart to the Credit Facility Amendment Agreement and
other ancillary agreements thereto;

 



 

(d) the executed counterpart to the Assignment Agreement, necessary to vest
all right, title and interest of Fund G in and to the Membership Interest to
the Partnership,

 



 

(e) the Assignment Agreement necessary to vest all right, title and interest
of the Partnership in and to the Membership Interest to OpCo, and such other
customary instruments of transfer and conveyance, including, if requested by
the partnership, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement between LD 12 and
Landmark Infrastructure Asset OpCo LLC, necessary to vest all right, title and
interest of LD 12 in and to certain of the Assets to Landmark Infrastructure
Asset OpCo LLC;

 



 

(f) a settlement statement mutually approved by the Parties; and

 



 

(g) each other document or instrument specified in or as may be reasonably

13.4 _Subsequent Closing_. Following the Closing but prior to August 30, 2017,
upon the satisfaction of Section 10.3 and the following conditions, or in the
case of the condition in _Section 13.4(c)_, a waiver of such condition by
Fund G, the Partnership shall issue the Reserved Units in book-entry form to
Fund G (the " _Subsequent Closing_ "), which Reserved Units for the avoidance
of doubt shall have no rights to distributions or voting or any other
ownership rights prior to the issuance on the date of the Subsequent Closing:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) LD 12 shall have received an Easement related to each of the Sunset
Assets;

 



 

(b) the Partnership shall have paid all consideration required under the
Sunset Purchase Agreements and closed on the respective transactions under the
Sunset Purchase Agreements; and

 



 

(c) the representations and warranties of Fund G set forth in Section 3.18 and
the Partnership set forth in _Article 4_ of this Agreement shall be true and
correct in all material respects (it being understood that, for purposes of
determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, all
qualifications and other materiality qualifications contained in such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded) as of the Subsequent
Closing with the same force and effect and as though made as of the Subsequent
Closing (except those representations and warranties that address matters only
as of a specified date, the accuracy of which shall be determined as of that
specified date in all respects).

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, if the conditions subsequent set forth in this
Section 13.4 have not been met, or waived as applicable, and the Subsequent
Closing shall not have occurred, by August 30, 2017, then neither Party shall
have any further rights or obligations under this _Section 13.4_ or to the
Reserved Units; provided, however, OpCo or LD 12 shall retain the Sunset
Assets.

 



 

13.5 _Credits and Prorations_.

 



 

(a) _General Matters_. All income and expenses relating to the Assets shall be
apportioned as of 12:01 a.m., Los Angeles time, on the day of Closing, Fund G
being charged and credited for the same prior to such date and time, and the
Partnership being charged and credited for the same on and after such date and
time. Such prorated items include the following:

 



 

(i) all rents and other accounts receivables payable with respect to the
Assets (" _Rents and A/R_ ") received by the Closing, if any;

 



 

(ii) all Property Taxes for which LD 12 has not properly accrued; and

 



 

(iii) utility charges for which LD 12 is liable, if any, such charges to be
apportioned at Closing on the basis of the most recent meter reading occurring
prior to Closing or, if unmetered, on the basis of a current bill for each
such utility.

 



 

(b) _Specific Matters_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section
13.5_:

 



 

(i) Any Property Taxes paid at or prior to Closing shall be prorated based
upon the amounts actually paid. If any Property Taxes due and payable during
the year of Closing have not been paid before Closing or properly accrued for
by LD 12, Fund G shall be charged at Closing an amount equal to that portion
of such Property Taxes which relates to the period before Closing, and LD 12
shall pay, or cause to be paid, such Property Taxes prior to their becoming
delinquent. Any such apportionment made with respect to a Property Tax year
for which the Property Tax rate or assessed valuation, or both, have not yet
been fixed shall be based upon the Property Tax rate or assessed valuation
fixed. To the extent that the actual Property Taxes for the current year
differ from the amount apportioned at Closing, the Parties shall make all
necessary adjustments by appropriate payments between themselves within thirty
30 days after such amounts are determined following Closing, subject to the
provisions of _Section 13.5(c)_ below. The Partnership shall pay all
supplemental Property Tax resulting from the change in ownership and
reassessment, if any, occurring as the result of the Closing pursuant to this
Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Charges referred to in clause (i) above that are payable by any third
party (as opposed to Fund G, the Partnership or LD 12) shall not be
apportioned hereunder, and the Partnership and LD 12 shall look solely to the
third party responsible therefor for the payment of such charges. If Fund G
shall have paid any of such charges on behalf of any third party to which it
is entitled to reimbursement, and shall not have been reimbursed therefor by
the time of Closing, the Partnership shall credit to Fund G an amount equal to
all such charges so paid by Fund G;

 



 

(iii) Unpaid and delinquent Rents and A/R collected by Fund G or the
Partnership, as the case may be, after the date of Closing shall be delivered
as follows: (1) if Fund G collects any unpaid or delinquent Rents and A/R for
the Assets, Fund G shall, within 15 days after the receipt thereof, deliver to
the Partnership any such Rents and A/R which the Partnership is entitled to
hereunder relating to the date of Closing and any period thereafter, and (2)
if the Partnership or LD 12 collects any unpaid or delinquent Rents and A/R,
the Partnership shall, within 15 days after the receipt thereof, deliver to
Fund G any such Rents and A/R which Fund G is entitled to hereunder relating
to the period prior to the date of Closing. The Parties agree that (i) all
Rents and A/R received by either Party (or LD 12) within the first 30 day
period after the date of Closing shall be applied first to delinquent Rents
and A/R, if any, in the order of their maturity, and then to current Rents and
A/R, and (ii) all Rents and A/R received by either Party (or LD 12) after the
first 30 day period after the date of Closing shall be applied first to
current Rents and A/R and then to delinquent Rents and A/R, if any, in the
inverse order of maturity. The Partnership will use commercially reasonable
efforts after Closing to collect all Rents and A/R in the Ordinary Course of
Business, but neither the Partnership nor LD 12 will be obligated to institute
any lawsuit or other collection procedures to collect delinquent Rents and
A/R. If there shall be any Rents and A/R which, although relating to a period
prior to Closing, do not become due and payable until after Closing or are
paid prior to Closing but are subject to adjustment after, then any Rents and
A/R of such type received by either Party (or LD 12) shall, to the extent
applicable to a period extending through the Closing, be prorated between Fund
G and the Partnership as of Closing and Fund Gs portion thereof shall be
remitted promptly to Fund G by the Partnership together with a reasonably
detailed accounting from the Partnership.

 



 

(c) _Final Adjustments_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any revenue or
expense amount which cannot be ascertained with certainty as of Closing shall
be prorated on the basis of the Parties reasonable estimates of such amount
and current receipts, and shall be the subject of a final proration 60 days
after Closing, or as soon thereafter as the precise amounts can be
ascertained. The Partnership shall promptly notify Fund G when it becomes
aware that any such estimated amount has been ascertained. Once all revenue
and expense amounts have been ascertained, the Parties shall jointly and in
good faith prepare a final proration statement, which final proration
statement when agreed upon by the Parties, shall be conclusively deemed to be
accurate and final.

 



 

(d) _Survival_. The provisions of this _Section 13.5_ shall survive Closing.

 



 

13.6 _Closing Costs_. The following costs of Closing shall be allocated
between Fund G and the Partnership as follows:

 



 

(a) All fees associated with reissuance of title policies delivered to the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 7.2_ shall be paid by the Partnership;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) All other title fees and premiums, all recordation fees, and all transfer,
stamp, excise or similar taxes imposed by the state, county or city in
connection with the transaction shall be divided equally and paid by Fund G
and the Partnership at Closing;

 



 

(c) All sales or similar Taxes shall be paid by the Partnership; and

 



 

(d) Each party shall bear its own counsels fees and expenses in connection
with the transactions described in this Agreement.

 



 

The provisions of this _Section 13.6_ shall survive the Closing.

14.5 _Choice of Law; Mediation; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

state. EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT INVOLVES AT LEAST U.S.
$100,000.00 AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ENTERED INTO IN EXPRESS RELIANCE
UPON 6 Del. C. § 2708. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

(b) Each Party agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether in tort or
contract or at law or in equity, exclusively in any federal or state courts
located in Delaware and (i) waives any objection to laying venue in any such

courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over it and (iii)
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, service of process upon
it may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
(or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its
address specified in _Section 14.4_. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction

condition of this Agreement or right to enforcement thereof shall be
effective, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by both Parties. Any
such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way adversely affect the rights of
the Party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The
failure of any Party to exercise any rights or privileges under this Agreement
shall not be construed as a waiver of any such rights or privileges under this
Agreement. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative
and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, none is
exclusive of any other or of any rights or remedies that any Party may
hereunder or otherwise have at law or in equity.

Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained
herein.

Agreement, each Party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection with
