repayment of all or a portion of the Intercompany Debt outstanding at such
time;

 

WHEREAS, at the REB Transfer Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, if and as necessary, Weyerhaeuser will cause (a)
the Transferred REB Assets to be transferred to and the Assumed REB
Liabilities to be assumed by WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries and (b) the

WHEREAS the parties hereto intend the Transactions to qualify for the Intended

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby,
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_New Debt and Intercompany Debt; the REB Transfers_

SECTION 1.01. _New Debt; Repayment of Intercompany Debt_. (a) Prior to the
REB Transfer Time, WRECO shall enter into a definitive agreement or
agreements (the " _New Debt Agreements_ ") providing for indebtedness (the "
_New Debt_ ") in an aggregate principal amount of not less than
$800,000,000 (the " _New Debt Amount_ ") on the terms and conditions set
forth in the New Debt Commitment Letter, or if different from the terms and
conditions set forth in the New Debt Commitment Letter, on terms and
conditions reasonably agreed to by Parent and Weyerhaeuser.

(b) Immediately prior to the REB Transfer Time, (i) WRECO shall incur the New
Debt and receive the net proceeds thereof and (ii) WRECO shall pay to WNR the
Payment Amount, in immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by Weyerhaeuser, in repayment of all or a portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Intercompany Debt outstanding at such time. In the
event that the aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Debt outstanding
immediately prior to the REB Transfer Time exceeds the Payment Amount, then
Weyerhaeuser shall cause WNR to contribute to the capital of WRECO any
remaining principal balance of the Intercompany Debt, effective as of
immediately prior to the REB Transfer Time, and after such contribution WRECO
shall have no further Liability in respect of the Intercompany Debt, except
as contemplated by Section 1.01(c). In the event that the aggregate principal
amount of the Intercompany Debt outstanding immediately prior to the REB
Transfer Time is less than the Payment Amount, then Weyerhaeuser shall cause
WRECO to distribute to WNR as a dividend the amount by which the Payment
Amount exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Debt.

 

(c) Immediately prior to the REB Transfer Time, WRECO shall pay to WNR an
amount in immediately available funds (the " _Accrued Interest Amount_ ")
equal to all unpaid interest on the Intercompany Debt that accrued between the
date hereof and the REB Transfer Time, before taking into account any
repayment or capitalization thereof pursuant to Section 1.01(b).

 



2 SECTION 1.02. _The REB Transfers_. (a) On the terms and subject to the

(the " _REB Transfer Time_ "), if and as necessary, Weyerhaeuser shall cause
the following transactions to occur (collectively, the " _REB Transfers_ "):

 

(i) if any REB Assets are held by Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary
(other than WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries) as of immediately prior to the

Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries to, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to WRECO or
a WRECO Subsidiary, and Weyerhaeuser shall cause WRECO or the
applicable WRECO Subsidiary to accept from Weyerhaeuser and any such
applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, all of Weyerhaeusers and such
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiarys right, title and interest in, to and under all such

(ii) if any REB Liabilities are Liabilities of Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary (other than WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries) as of immediately
prior to the REB Transfer Time, Weyerhaeuser shall cause WRECO or a WRECO
Subsidiary to irrevocably assume and agree to faithfully pay, perform and
discharge when due all such REB Liabilities (the REB Liabilities to be
assumed by WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 1.02(a)(ii),
collectively, the " _Assumed REB Liabilities_ "), except for any Delayed
Transfer Liabilities;

 

(iii) if any Excluded Assets are held by WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary as of
immediately prior to the REB Transfer Time, Weyerhaeuser shall cause WRECO
and all applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to assign, transfer, convey and deliver
to Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than WRECO or any WRECO
Subsidiary), and Weyerhaeuser shall, or shall cause the applicable
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary to, accept from WRECO and any such applicable WRECO
Subsidiary, all of WRECOs and such WRECO Subsidiarys right, title and
interest in, to and under all such Excluded Assets (the Excluded Assets to
be assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to Weyerhaeuser or a
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 1.02(a)(iii), collectively,
the " _Transferred Excluded Assets_ "), except for any Delayed Transfer
Assets; and 

(iv) if any Excluded Liabilities are Liabilities of WRECO or any WRECO
Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the REB Transfer Time, Weyerhaeuser
shall, or shall cause a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than WRECO or any WRECO
Subsidiary) to, irrevocably assume and agree to faithfully pay, perform and

be assumed by Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary pursuant to this
Section 1.02(a)(iv), collectively, the " _Assumed Excluded Liabilities_ "),
except for any Delayed Transfer Liabilities.

of any Transferred REB Asset to WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary or of any
Transferred Excluded Asset to Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other
than WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary) in connection with the REB Transfers
would constitute a violation of applicable Law, or would require a Consent or
Governmental Approval that has not been obtained or made prior to the REB
Transfer Time, then the assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such
Transferred REB Asset or Transferred Excluded Asset (collectively, the "
_Delayed Transfer Assets_ ") will automatically be deferred, and no such
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery will occur, until all legal
impediments are removed or such Consents or Governmental Approvals have been
obtained or made with respect to the applicable Delayed Transfer Assets.
Notwithstanding such deferral of the assignment, transfer, conveyance
and delivery of the Delayed Transfer Assets, any Delayed Transfer Asset will
still be considered an REB Asset or Excluded Asset, as the case may be, and
from the REB Transfer Time until the consummation of assignment, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of such Delayed Transfer Asset, Weyerhaeuser or the
applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary)
shall hold any Transferred REB Assets that are Delayed Transfer Assets in
trust for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably practicable, of WRECO or
the applicable WRECO Subsidiary at the sole expense of WRECO or the applicable
WRECO Subsidiary, and WRECO or the applicable WRECO Subsidiary shall hold any
Transferred Excluded Assets that are Delayed Transfer Assets in trust for the

Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary. Weyerhaeuser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to develop and implement arrangements to place WRECO and the WRECO
Subsidiaries and Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries (other than
WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries), as the case may be, insofar as reasonably
practicable, in the same position as if the Delayed Transfer Assets had been
assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered and so that all the benefits and
burdens relating to such Delayed Transfer Assets, including possession, use,
risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such
asset, inure from and after the REB Transfer Time to WRECO and the WRECO
Subsidiaries, in the case of Transferred REB Assets that are Delayed Transfer
Assets, or to Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries (other than
WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries), in the case of Transferred Excluded Assets
that are Delayed Transfer Assets. If and when the legal impediments, Consents
or Governmental Approvals, the presence or the absence of which caused the
deferral of the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of any Delayed
Transfer Assets pursuant to this Section 1.05(a), are removed, obtained or
made, as the case may be, the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery
of the applicable Delayed Transfer Asset shall be promptly effected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other applicable
Transaction Documents, without the payment of additional consideration.
On the Closing Date, Weyerhaeuser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Parent (for information purposes only) a schedule setting forth all
material Delayed Transfer Assets existing as of the Closing Date.

 

(b) Subject to Section 1.05(c), to the extent that the assumption of any
Assumed REB Liability by WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary or of any Assumed
Excluded Liability by Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than
WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary) in connection with the REB Transfers would
constitute a violation of applicable Law, or would require a Consent or
Governmental Approval that has not been obtained or made prior to the REB
Transfer Time, then the assumption of such Assumed REB Liability or Assumed
Excluded Liability (collectively, the " _Delayed Transfer Liabilities_ ") will
automatically be deferred, and no such assumption will occur, until all legal
impediments are removed or such Consents or Governmental Approvals have been
obtained or made with respect to the applicable Delayed Transfer Liability.
Notwithstanding such deferral of the assumption of the Delayed Transfer
Liabilities, any Delayed Transfer Liability will still be considered an REB
Liability or Excluded Liability, as the case may be, and from the REB Transfer
Time until the consummation of the assumption of such Delayed Transfer
Liability, Weyerhaeuser or the applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than
WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary) shall hold any Assumed REB Liabilities that are
Delayed Transfer Liabilities in trust for the use and benefit, insofar
as reasonably practicable, of WRECO or the applicable WRECO Subsidiary at the
sole expense of WRECO or the applicable WRECO Subsidiary, and WRECO or the
applicable WRECO Subsidiary shall hold any Assumed Excluded Liabilities that
are Delayed Transfer Liabilities in trust for the use and benefit, insofar as
reasonably practicable, of Weyerhaeuser or the applicable Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary (other than WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary) at the sole expense of
Weyerhaeuser or the applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary. Weyerhaeuser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and implement arrangements to
place WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries and Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries (other than WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries), as the case may
be, insofar as reasonably practicable, in

 



10  the same position as if the Delayed Transfer Liabilities had been assumed
and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Transfer
Liabilities inure from and after the REB Transfer Time to WRECO and the WRECO
Subsidiaries, in the case of Assumed REB Liabilities that are Delayed Transfer
Liabilities, or to Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries (other than
WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries), in the case of Assumed Excluded
Liabilities that are Delayed Transfer Liabilities. If and when the legal
impediments, Consents or Governmental Approvals, the presence or the absence
of which caused the deferral of the assumption of any Delayed Transfer
Assets pursuant to this Section 1.05(b), are removed, obtained or made, as
the case may be, the assumption of the applicable Delayed Transfer Liability
shall be promptly effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the other applicable Transaction Documents, without the payment of additional
consideration. On the Closing Date, Weyerhaeuser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent (for information purposes only) a schedule
setting forth all material Delayed Transfer Liabilities existing as of the
Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in Section 1.05(a) or Section 1.05(b) to
the contrary, Weyerhaeuser or WRECO may elect at any time after the Effective
Time to require the immediate assignment, transfer, assumption, conveyance or
delivery of any Delayed Transfer Asset or any Delayed Transfer Liability
notwithstanding any requirement that an immaterial Consent or an immaterial
Governmental Approval be obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if WRECO
so elects to require the immediate assignment, transfer, assumption,
conveyance or delivery of any such Delayed Transfer Assets or such Delayed
Transfer Liabilities, any Liability arising from such assignment, transfer,
assumption, conveyance or delivery will be deemed to be REB Liabilities, (ii)
if Weyerhaeuser so elects to require the immediate assignment, transfer,
assumption, conveyance or delivery of any such Delayed Transfer Assets or such
Delayed Transfer Liabilities, any Liability arising from such assignment,
transfer, assumption, conveyance or delivery will be deemed to be Excluded
Liabilities and (iii) if WRECO and Weyerhaeuser jointly agree to the immediate
assignment, transfer, assumption, conveyance or delivery of any such Delayed
Transfer Assets or such Delayed Transfer Liabilities, any Liability
arising from such assignment, transfer, assumption, conveyance or delivery
will be shared equally between WRECO and Weyerhaeuser and, notwithstanding any
provision in Section 12.04 to the contrary, the defense of any Third Party
Claim relating thereto shall be jointly managed by WRECO and Weyerhaeuser.

(d) For a period of three years after the REB Transfer Time, subject
to Section 1.05(f), (i) each of Weyerhaeuser and WRECO shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to remove all legal

Assets and the Transferred Excluded Assets as contemplated by Section 1.02 as
promptly as practicable and (ii) each of Weyerhaeuser and WRECO shall, and

_Closing Adjustment _

SECTION 5.01. _Estimated Adjustment Amount_. No later than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Weyerhaeuser shall prepare and deliver to Parent a
statement setting forth Weyerhaeusers good faith estimate of the Adjustment
Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ "). If the
Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, Parent shall, at the
Closing, pay to WNR the Estimated Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated
Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, Weyerhaeuser shall cause WNR to, at
the Closing, pay to Parent the absolute value of the Estimated Adjustment
Amount. 

SECTION 5.02. _Closing Adjustment Statement_. Within 45 days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Weyerhaeuser a statement (the "
_Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth Parents calculation of the
Adjustment Amount.

 

SECTION 5.03. _Objections; Resolution of Disputes_. The Closing Adjustment
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th day
following delivery thereof, unless Weyerhaeuser gives written notice of its
disagreement with the Closing Adjustment Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Parent prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
asserted, (ii) only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or
based on the Adjustment Amount not being calculated in accordance with Section
5.05 and (iii) be accompanied by a certificate of an executive officer of
Weyerhaeuser certifying that the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement are consistent with the requirements of Section 5.05. If a Notice
of Disagreement is received by Parent in a timely manner, then the Closing
Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall
become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date
Weyerhaeuser and Parent resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period,
Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration any and all matters that remain in
dispute and were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The dispute
resolution by the Accounting Firm shall be an arbitration under the Federal
Arbitration Act and relevant Laws of the State of New York. The Accounting
Firm shall be Deloitte LLP (or an Affiliate thereof) or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties

 



21  hereto in writing. Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision in writing resolving
the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 30 days of receipt of the
submission. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered upon such determination in
any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination
is to be enforced. The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of
the parties) pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall be borne by Parent
and Weyerhaeuser in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters
resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Other
than the fees and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence,
the fees and disbursements of Weyerhaeusers independent auditors shall be
borne by Weyerhaeuser and the fees and disbursements of Parents independent
auditors shall be borne by Parent.

SECTION 5.04. _Post-Closing Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Estimated Adjustment Amount, Parent shall, within 15 Business Days after the
Closing Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding on the parties pursuant
to Section 5.03, pay to WNR the amount by which the Adjustment Amount exceeds
the Estimated Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount is less than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount, Weyerhaeuser shall cause WNR to, within 15
Business Days after the Closing Adjustment Statement becomes final
and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 5.03, pay to Parent the amount
by which the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment Amount. Any
payment made pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing at
least two Business Days prior to such payment by the party entitled to receive
such payment, plus interest thereon at a rate of interest per annum equal to
the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase
Bank as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

party will not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with
the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any

termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any Person under, or result in the creation of any

Plan is qualified and exempt from Federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has
been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Parent, has revocation been threatened,
nor has the Parent 401(k) Plan been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification.

 

(d) No Parent Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan", as
described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (each, a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), is

Effect.

(f) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan", as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (each, a " _Parent Pension Plan_ "), and
that is intended to be tax qualified has been the subject of determination

the IRS has provided a current determination letter to the effect that such
Parent Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income Taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such
determination letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Parent, has
revocation been threatened, nor has any such Parent Pension Plan been amended
since the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor
in any respect that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs (other than any amendment to
permit WRECO Employees to participate in such plan) or require "security"
within the meaning of Section 307 of ERISA.

 

(g) No Parent Pension Plan, other than any Parent Pension Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "

Section 4975 of the Code, or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that
would reasonably be expected to subject Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any
Parent Employee to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA,
except to the extent that any such taxes or penalties, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. None of such Parent Benefit Plans and trusts has been
terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event", as such term is defined
in Section 4043 of ERISA, with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan during the
last five years, except to the extent that any such reportable events,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal", as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA, since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and
4205 with respect to any Parent Multiemployer Pension Plan.

(h) The execution and delivery of each Transaction Document do not, and the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not (i) entitle any Parent Employee to severance, termination,
change in control or similar pay and benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable
under or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Parent
Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any Parent Benefit Plan, in each case, except for any payments or
benefits required by applicable Law.

property or the vesting of property) as a result of the Transactions by any
officer, director, manager or employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary who
is a "disqualified individual", as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1, under any Parent Benefit Plan or other compensation
arrangement would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment", as such
term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, and no such disqualified
individual is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax
gross up or other payment) from Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any other
Person in the event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the
Code is imposed on such disqualified individual.

SECTION 6.12. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any claim that has been asserted against or affecting Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary with respect to an Action (and Parent is not aware of any
basis for any such Action or claim) that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or to which any of their respective properties or assets is subject
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material

affiliated group (or similar state, local or foreign filing group) filing a
consolidated U.S. Federal income Tax Return (other than the group the common
parent of which was Weyerhaeuser prior to January 1, 2010, and WNR after
December 31, 2009) or (ii) has any material liability for the Taxes of any
person (other than Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

(d) Neither WRECO nor any WRECO Subsidiary is bound by any material agreement
or arrangement with respect to Taxes other than (i) the Tax Sharing Agreement
and (ii) the Tax Allocation Agreement between WNR and WRECO, which will be
terminated on or prior to the Distribution Date in accordance with Section
1.07(a). In particular, no written agreement or other written document waiving
or extending, or having the effect of waiving or extending, the statutes of
limitations or the period of assessment or collection of any Taxes relating
to the Real Estate Business, the REB Assets, WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary,
and no power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes, has been filed or
entered into with any Taxing Authority.

 



44 (e) Except for those matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse
Effect, as of the date hereof, (i) no audit or other administrative
proceedings or proceedings before any Taxing Authority are presently pending
with regard to any Taxes or Tax Return relating to the Real Estate Business,
the REB Assets, WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary as to which any Taxing Authority
has asserted in writing any claim and (ii) no Taxing Authority is now
asserting in writing any deficiency or claim for Taxes or any adjustment to
Taxes with respect to the Real Estate Business, the REB Assets, WRECO or any
WRECO Subsidiary for which WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary may be liable with
respect to Taxes that has not been fully paid or finally settled.

 

(f) Neither WRECO nor any WRECO Subsidiary has agreed to make or is required
to make any adjustment for a taxable period ending after the Closing Date
under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or
otherwise, except where such adjustments have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an REB
Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Within the past two years, WRECO has not been a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify for tax-
free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (other than in connection with
the Distribution).

 

(h) Neither Weyerhaeuser (with respect to Real Estate Business and the REB
Assets) nor WRECO has, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, "participated" in a
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.6011-4,
other than a transaction exempted from the reporting requirements of such
Regulation.

 

(i) Neither Weyerhaeuser nor WRECO has taken or agreed to take any action or
knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that has prevented,
or would reasonably be expected to prevent, the Distribution from qualifying
as tax-free pursuant to Section 355 of the Code, or that has prevented, or
would reasonably be expected to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code.

SECTION 7.10. _Employment Agreements; ERISA Compliance; Excess
Parachute Payments_. (a) Section 7.10(a) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure
Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, a true and complete list of (i) each
WRECO Benefit Plan and (ii) each material Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan.
Weyerhaeuser has delivered or made available to Parent true and complete
copies of (1) each WRECO Benefit Plan and Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan, in
each case, required to be listed in Section 7.10(a) of the Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter (or, in the case of any unwritten WRECO Benefit Plan or
Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan required to be listed in Section 7.10(a) of the
Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter, a description thereof), (2) the most recent
annual report on Form 5500 filed with respect to each such WRECO Benefit Plan
and Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (3) the
most recent

 



45  summary plan description for each such WRECO Benefit Plan and Weyerhaeuser
REB Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is required and (iii)
the most recent actuarial valuation report, if any, for each such WRECO
Benefit Plan and Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan.

(b) The WRECO Benefit Plans have been administered in compliance with their
terms and applicable Law, other than instances of non-compliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Each Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan has been the subject of determination
letters from the IRS with respect to all Tax Law changes with respect to
which the IRS has provided a current determination letter to the effect that
such Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan is qualified and exempt from Federal income
Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no
such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of
Weyerhaeuser, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Weyerhaeuser
401(k) Plan been amended since the date of its most recent determination
letter or application therefor in any respect that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect its qualification.

(d) No WRECO Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan", as
described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (an " _REB Welfare Plan_ "), is funded or
insured through a "welfare benefits fund", as such term is defined in Section
419(e) of the Code. Each REB Welfare Plan that is a "group health plan", as
such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, complies with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code. No REB Welfare Plan
provides health or life insurance benefits after termination of employment,
except where coverage is mandated by applicable Law or the cost thereof is
borne entirely by the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents).

 

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse
Effect, no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in
the imposition of Controlled Group Liability on WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary
following the Effective Time as a result of WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary being
treated as a single employer with Weyerhaeuser prior to the Distribution for
purposes of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

(f) No WRECO Benefit Plan is or will be at the Effective Time a
"multiemployer pension plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA. No WRECO Benefit
Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(g) The execution and delivery of each Transaction Document do not, and the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not, (i) entitle any REB Employee to severance, termination,
change in control or similar pay and benefits under any WRECO Benefit Plan
or Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable
under or trigger any 

 



46  other material obligation pursuant to, any WRECO Benefit Plan or
Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan with respect to any REB Employee or (iii) result
in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any WRECO Benefit Plan, in
each case, except for any payments or benefits required by applicable Law or
for which Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries (other than WRECO and
the WRECO Subsidiaries) shall be solely liable.

 

(h) No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of the Transactions by any
WRECO Employee who is a "disqualified individual", as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, under any WRECO Benefit Plan or
Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment", as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, and no
such disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional payment
(including any tax gross up or other payment) from WRECO, any WRECO
Subsidiary or any other Person in the event that the excise tax required by
Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual.

 

SECTION 7.11. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
Weyerhaeuser, any claim that has been asserted against or affecting
Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary relating to the Real Estate
Business with respect to an Action (and Weyerhaeuser is not aware of any basis
for any such Action or claim) that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect, nor
is there any Judgment outstanding against Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary or to which any of their respective properties or assets is subject
relating to the Real Estate Business that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect. This Section 7.11 does not
relate to Environmental Claims, which are the subject of Section 7.13, or
intellectual property matters, which are the subject of Section 7.15.

SECTION 7.12. _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. With respect to the Real
Estate Business only, Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries are, and
have been since January 1, 2011, in compliance with all applicable Laws,
except for instances of non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to the Real Estate Business only, neither
Weyerhaeuser nor any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has received any written
communication since January 1, 2011 from a Governmental Entity that alleges
that Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is not in compliance in any
material respect with any applicable Law, which alleged non-compliance has not
been materially resolved as of the date hereof. After giving effect to the
REB Transfers, WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries will possess all Governmental
Approvals necessary for the lawful conduct of the Real Estate Business as
currently conducted, except for any failure to have such Governmental
Approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect. This Section
7.12 does not relate to Tax matters, which are the subject of Section 7.09, or
Environmental Laws, which are the subject of Section 7.13.

SECTION 7.13. _Environmental Matters_. (a) Except for those matters
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect:

 

(i) with respect to the Real Estate Business only, Weyerhaeuser and the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries are, and have been since January 1, 2009, in
compliance with all Environmental Laws;

 



47 (ii) since January 1, 2009, neither Weyerhaeuser nor any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has received any written notice that alleges that the
Real Estate Business is in violation of, or has liability under, any
Environmental Law, which alleged violation or liability has not been
materially resolved as of the date hereof; 

(iii) Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries have obtained and are in
compliance with all Environmental Permits necessary for the operation of the
Real Estate Business as currently conducted, all such Environmental Permits
are valid and in good standing and neither Weyerhaeuser nor any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary has been advised by any Governmental Entity of any actual or
potential change in the status or terms and conditions of any such
Environmental Permit;

(iv) there are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the knowledge of
Weyerhaeuser, threatened that have been asserted against or affecting
Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary relating to the Real Estate
Business;

 

(v) to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, there have been no Releases of any
Hazardous Material that have formed the basis of any Environmental Claim
relating to the Real Estate Business pending against Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or against any Person whose liabilities for such
Environmental Claims relating to the Real Estate Business Weyerhaeuser or
any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has retained or assumed, either contractually or
by operation of Law; and

(vi) to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, neither Weyerhaeuser nor any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has retained or assumed, either contractually or by
operation of Law, any Liabilities that have had or would reasonably be
expected to form the basis of any Environmental Claim or Environmental
Liability relating to the Real Estate Business against Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary.

(b) This Section 7.13 contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of Weyerhaeuser and WRECO with respect to environmental matters,
including Environmental Laws, Environmental Liabilities and Environmental
Claims.

 

SECTION 7.14. _Real and Personal Property_. (a) Section 7.14(a) of the
Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list, as of the
date hereof, of all REB Owned Real Property. After giving effect to the REB
Transfers, (i) WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary will have good and insurable fee
simple title to all REB Owned Real Property, in each case free and clear of
all Liens other than (A) Liens securing indebtedness reflected in the WRECO
Financial Statements, (B) Liens consisting of zoning or planning restrictions,
permits, easements, covenants and other restrictions or limitations on
the use or occupancy of real property or irregularities in title thereto,
which do not materially impair the use of such property as it is presently
used or intended to be used in connection with the Real Estate Business, 

 



48  (C) Liens for current Taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies
on property not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and
for which adequate reserves have been created in accordance with GAAP, (D)
mechanics, carriers, workmens, materialmens, repairmens and similar Liens
arising in the ordinary course of business and (E) Liens which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the use of such assets as they are presently used or intended
to be used in connection with the Real Estate Business (the items in clauses
(A) through (E), collectively, " _REB Permitted Liens_ ") and (ii) there are
no reversion rights, outstanding options or rights of first refusal in favor
of any other Person to purchase, lease, occupy or otherwise utilize the REB
Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the use of such REB
Owned Real Property as it is presently used or intended to be used in
connection with the Real Estate Business. To the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser,
there is no pending or threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceeding
with respect to any REB Owned Real Property. No developer-related charges or
assessments imposed by any Governmental Entity or other Person
for improvements (or otherwise) against any REB Owned Real Property held for
development are unpaid, except for charges or assessments reflected in the
Interim WRECO Balance Sheet or incurred after the date of the Interim WRECO
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business. No Law or Judgment exists
or is pending before a Governmental Entity that restricts the development or
sale of REB Owned Real Property that is currently under development or being
held for sale by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, other than any
such Law or Judgment that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect. With
respect to any REB Owned Real Property that is under development as a
subdivision or community, such subdivisions or communities under development
are or will be supplied with utilities, including electricity, water,
telephone, sanitary sewer and storm sewer, and other services necessary for
the intended operation of such subdivisions or communities, all of which
utilities and services are adequate for such operation pursuant to all
applicable Laws, other than any failure to supply utilities or services that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 7.14(b) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets forth a true
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all REB Optioned Real Property.
After giving effect to the REB Transfers, WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary will
have a valid option to acquire all REB Optioned Real Property pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of the relevant option or purchase Contract, in
each case free and clear of all Liens other than REB Permitted Liens.
Weyerhaeuser has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of each
material option or purchase Contract under which the REB Optioned Real
Property is held. There is no default under any such Contract by Weyerhaeuser
or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, by any
other party thereto that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Section 7.14(c) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter sets forth a true
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all REB Leased Real Property.
After giving effect to the REB Transfers, WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary will
have good and valid title to the leasehold estates in all REB Leased Real
Property, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than REB Permitted
Liens. Weyerhaeuser has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of
each 

 



49  material lease agreement under which the REB Leased Real Property is held.
There is no default under any such lease by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, by any other party thereto
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) After giving effect to the REB Transfers, WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary will
have good and valid title to all personal properties and assets necessary for
the conduct of the Real Estate Business, including the REB Governmental
Approvals, the REB Third Party Approvals and the Development Reimbursements,
free and clear of all Liens other than REB Permitted Liens, except for any
failure to have good and valid title that, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material
Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 7.15. _Intellectual Property_. (a) Section 7.15(a) of the Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all Registered
Intellectual Property owned by Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary and
included in the REB Intellectual Property Rights (the " _REB Registered
Intellectual Property_ "). The REB Registered Intellectual Property is
subsisting and, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, valid and enforceable. As of
the date hereof, Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is the sole and
exclusive owner of all the REB Registered Intellectual Property, free and
clear of all Liens other than REB Permitted Liens. Neither Weyerhaeuser nor
any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has granted an exclusive license to any REB
Registered Intellectual Property, and no material license fees are currently
being paid for the use by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary of any
third party Intellectual Property Rights used or held for use solely in the
operation or conduct of the Real Estate Business.

 

(b) Except for those matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse
Effect, no claims are pending or, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, have been
asserted, as of the date hereof against Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary by any Person (i) claiming that Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary is infringing or has infringed any Intellectual
Property Right in the operation or conduct of the Real Estate Business as
currently conducted or (ii) challenging the validity, ownership,
patentability, enforceability, registrability or use by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary of any REB Registered Intellectual Property. Except
for those matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have an REB Material Adverse Effect, as
of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, the conduct of the Real
Estate Business by or on behalf of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary
is not infringing upon, misappropriating, violating, diluting or constituting
the unauthorized use of, any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party,
and no Person is infringing or misappropriating the rights of Weyerhaeuser or
any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary with respect to any REB Registered Intellectual
Property.

 

(c) To the knowledge of Weyerhaeuser, all current and former employees,
consultants and contractors of Weyerhaeuser or any of the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries who have contributed to the development of material
Intellectual Property Rights that are being used in the conduct of the Real
Estate Business have signed agreements assigning their rights in such
contributions to Weyerhaeuser or the applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary.

 



50 (d) The REB Intellectual Property Rights and the Intellectual Property Rights
licensed to WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary pursuant to the REB Contracts
constitute all of the material Intellectual Property Rights reasonably
necessary for the conduct of the Real Estate Business as currently conducted.

Real Estate Business has any material outstanding obligation, including any
indemnification obligations;

(vi) any (A) Contract granting to Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary

7.16(a) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter or entered into after the date
hereof is or will be in full force and effect (except to the extent any of
them expires in accordance with its terms), and neither Weyerhaeuser nor any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary has violated any provisions of, or committed or
failed to perform any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any REB Material
Contract, except for any violation or default that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an REB
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of each written REB Material
Contract, and a summary of each oral REB Material Contract, listed in Section

to the other parties hereto and to the Representatives of such other parties
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period from the date

systems, Contracts, commitments, Representatives and Records (including
financial Records, but, in the case of Weyerhaeuser and WRECO, excluding
Records that constitute Excluded Assets), and during such period, each of
Weyerhaeuser, WRECO, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to (in the case of Weyerhaeuser, with respect to the Real Estate

document filed by it during the period from the date hereof to the Effective
Time pursuant to the requirements of U.S. Federal or state securities laws and
(ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as such requesting party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any party may withhold (A) any documents (or portions thereof) or
information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (B) any document (or portions thereof) or information which may
constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work product
and the transfer of which, or the provision of access to which, as reasonably
determined by such partys counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such
privilege and (C) any document (or portion thereof) or information relating to
pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such
document (or portion thereof) or information, as determined by such
partys counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for such
party or any of its Affiliates. If any material is withheld by a party
pursuant to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the requesting
party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. Upon its execution
of a work paper access letter in customary form, each of Parent and
Weyerhaeuser shall be afforded

transfer to WRECO or a WRECO Subsidiary all REB Records stored in tangible
form in the possession of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary
(including any such REB Records held in storage by a third party), except for
any REB Records that constitute Excluded Assets, and (ii) transfer to
Weyerhaeuser or a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary all Records that constitute Excluded
Assets stored in tangible form in the possession of WRECO or any WRECO
Subsidiary (including any such Records held in storage by a third party),
in each case at WRECOs expense. Weyerhaeuser shall be entitled to retain
copies of the REB Records transferred to WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 9.03(b).

 

(c) After the Distribution Date, except in the case of an Action by one party
against another party, each of Weyerhaeuser, WRECO, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to each other party, upon written request, the
former, current and future directors, officers, employees and other
Representatives of the Real Estate Business as witnesses, to the extent that
any such Person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors,
officers, employees and other Representatives) may reasonably be required in
connection with any Action in which the requesting party may from time to
time be involved, regardless of whether such Action is a matter with respect
to which indemnification may be sought hereunder. The requesting party shall
bear all costs and expenses in connection therewith.

 

(d) After the Distribution Date, WRECO shall, and shall cause the WRECO
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (and in any
event within 90 days after the Distribution Date) remove, erase, delete or
otherwise destroy all Weyerhaeuser information (whether in print, electronic
or other forms) in the possession of any WRECO Employee that does not
constitute an REB Asset.

(e) Following the Distribution Date, for so long as such information is
retained by a party or any of its Subsidiaries, upon reasonable written
notice, each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford or
cause to be afforded to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties,
systems, Contracts and Records (including financial records but, in the case
of Weyerhaeuser, excluding Records that constitute Excluded Assets) relating
to the Real Estate Business for any reasonable business purpose, including in
respect of litigation, insurance matters, financial reporting of such party
and its Affiliates, including by, as reasonably requested by the other party,
providing copies to the other party of any of the foregoing systems, Contracts
and Records (including financial records but, in the case of Weyerhaeuser,
excluding Records that constitute Excluded Assets) related to the Real Estate
Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party requesting such access
agrees to reimburse the other party promptly for all reasonable out-of-pocket

 



62  costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may withhold (A) any documents (or
portions thereof) or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party, (B) any document (or portions
thereof) or information which may constitute privileged attorney-client
communications or attorney work product and the transfer of which, or
the provision of access to which, as reasonably determined by such partys
counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such privilege and (C) any document (or
portion thereof) or information relating to pricing or other matters that are
highly sensitive if the exchange of such document (or portion thereof) or
information, as determined by such partys counsel, might reasonably result in
antitrust difficulties for such party or any of its Affiliates. If any
information is withheld by a party pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, such party shall inform the other party as to the general nature of
what is being withheld. Weyerhaeuser may redact such portions of any Records
that do not relate to the REB Assets, the REB Liabilities or the Real Estate
Business.

(f) All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 9.03 (or, in the case
of Section 9.03(b), retained by Weyerhaeuser) shall be held by the parties as
Confidential Information, as such term is defined in the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2013, between Weyerhaeuser
and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 9.04. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. (a) From the date hereof
through the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of
performance is expressly provided for herein), prior to, at and after the REB
Transfer Time, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including (i) obtaining all necessary or advisable Governmental
Approvals and making all necessary or advisable registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and taking all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining
all necessary or advisable Consents, (iii) defending against any Actions
challenging this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the

the purposes of the Transaction Documents, other than, in the case of each of

of Section 9.04(b). In connection with and without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction Document and (B) if
any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable

obtaining any necessary or advisable Consents and Governmental Approvals
pursuant to this Section 9.04(a).

 



63 (b) Each of the parties hereto shall (i) file, or cause to be filed, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof all notification and

Review Laws in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to

of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Review Laws and to obtain all Governmental Approvals under any Review Laws,
so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions).

 

(c) Nothing in Section 9.04(a) or 9.04(b) shall require any of the parties
hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries to (i) pay any consideration
to any third party from whom any Consent or Governmental Approval is
requested, other than filing fees paid to Governmental Entities, or (ii)
dispose of any of its assets or limit its freedom of action with respect to
any of its businesses, or consent to any disposition of any assets or limits
on its freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, or commit or

to remove any impediments to the Transactions relating to the HSR Act or
other applicable Review Laws or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any

 



64  injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding relating to Review Laws, other than dispositions, limitations,
consents or commitments that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Real Estate Business and the Parent Business, taken as a whole.

 

SECTION 9.05. _Rights Under Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policies_. (a) Weyerhaeuser
shall, and shall cause the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries to, keep all
Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policies currently maintained with respect to the REB
Assets and the Real Estate Business, or suitable replacements therefor, in
full force and effect through the close of business on the Distribution Date.

 

(b) Each of Parent and WRECO acknowledges that all Weyerhaeuser Insurance
Policies are not part of the Real Estate Business and are Excluded Assets.
Subject to Section 9.05(d), neither WRECO nor any WRECO Subsidiary will have
any rights under the Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policies from and after the REB
Transfer Time.

 

(c) From the date hereof through the Effective Time, each of the parties
hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to obtain for
WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries any insurance policies reasonably determined
by Parent to be necessary to replace the coverage currently provided by the
Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policies with respect to the REB Assets and the Real
Estate Business for incidents arising prior to the Distribution Date. All
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 9.05(c) shall be promptly
reimbursed by Parent.

 

(d) In the event that any REB Asset or the Real Estate Business suffers or has
suffered any damage, destruction or other casualty loss or any REB Liability
that is insured under the Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policies and arises or has
arisen prior to the Distribution Date, Weyerhaeuser shall, or shall cause the
appropriate Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary to, surrender to WRECO after the
Distribution Date any insurance proceeds received by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary under any Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policy with respect
to such damage, destruction or casualty loss, less (i) any amount of such
insurance proceeds applied by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary to
the physical restoration of such asset, (ii) the amount of all applicable
deductibles and co-payment provisions and all payment, reinsurance or
reimbursement obligations of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary in
respect thereof and (iii) the amount of Weyerhaeusers and each Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiarys reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, if any, incurred in
connection with the foregoing. Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries
may, at any time, without liability or obligation to WRECO, amend, commute,
terminate, buy out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any
Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policy. Neither Weyerhaeuser nor any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary shall bear any Liability for the failure of an
insurer to pay any claim under any Weyerhaeuser Insurance Policy.

SECTION 9.06.  _No Use of Retained Names_. WRECO shall, and shall cause the
WRECO Subsidiaries to, promptly, and in any event (a) within 60 days after the
Distribution Date, (a) make all necessary filings and take all other necessary
actions to discontinue any references to the Retained Names, (b) within 60
days after the Distribution Date, revise print

 



65  advertising, product labeling and all other information or other materials,
including any Internet or other electronic communications vehicles, to delete
all references to the Retained Names and (c) within 60 days after the
Distribution Date, change signage and stationery and otherwise discontinue use
of the Retained Names. In no event shall WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary use any
Retained Names after the Distribution in any manner or for any purpose
different from the use of such Retained Names by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary during the 90-day period preceding the Distribution
Date. After the Distribution Date, WRECO shall, and shall cause the WRECO
Subsidiaries to, file applications to amend or terminate any certificate of
assumed name or d/b/a filings, within 60 days after Parent or any of its
Affiliates becomes aware of such assumed name or d/b/a filing, so as to
eliminate the right of WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries to use the Retained
Names.

SECTION 9.07. _Weyerhaeuser Options, Weyerhaeuser PSUs and Weyerhaeuser
RSUs_. (a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Board of
Directors of Weyerhaeuser (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans) and the Board of Directors of WRECO shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:

(i) prior to the Distribution, each REB Employee who holds a Weyerhaeuser
equity award that is described in clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) below (each,
a " _Weyerhaeuser Equity Award_ ") shall surrender all of such REB Employees
Weyerhaeuser Equity Awards in exchange for substituted WRECO equity awards as
set forth in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) below, which shall, as of the
Effective Time, become Parent Equity Awards as specified in this Section 9.07
(any REB Employee who holds a Weyerhaeuser Equity Award, a " _Rollover
Employee_ ");

 

(ii) immediately prior to the Distribution, each outstanding option to acquire
Weyerhaeuser Common Shares granted under the Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans held by
a Rollover Employee (whether vested or unvested) (each, a " _Weyerhaeuser
Option_ ") shall be surrendered to Weyerhaeuser in exchange for an option
granted by WRECO to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Weyerhaeuser Option, a number of WRECO Common Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share), determined by multiplying the
number of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares subject to such Weyerhaeuser Option by
the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per WRECO Common Share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the per share exercise
price for the Weyerhaeuser Common Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to
such Weyerhaeuser Option divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio (each, as
so granted, a " _Substituted WRECO Option_ ");

(iii) any Weyerhaeuser Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock
option", as defined in Section 422 of the Code, that may not be treated in the
manner described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.07(a) and
that remains an incentive stock option shall be adjusted in accordance with
the requirements of Section 424 of the Code in a manner that most closely
produces the economic results obtained with respect to other Substituted WRECO
Options (it being understood that it is the intention of the parties hereto
that Substituted WRECO Options so granted by WRECO qualify, to the fullest
extent

 



66  permissible, as "incentive stock options", as defined in Section 422 of the
Code, to the extent that such Weyerhaeuser Options qualified as "incentive
stock options" immediately prior to the Distribution);

(iv) immediately prior to the Distribution, each outstanding performance
share unit with respect to Weyerhaeuser Common Shares granted under the
Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans held by a Rollover Employee (each, a " _Weyerhaeuser
PSU_ ") shall be surrendered to Weyerhaeuser in exchange for a grant of time-
vesting restricted share units by WRECO, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Weyerhaeuser PSU (except that such grant shall not
be subject to any performance-based vesting conditions or requirements), with
respect to the number of WRECO Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole share), determined by multiplying the number of Weyerhaeuser Common
Shares subject to such Weyerhaeuser PSU (which number shall be determined (A)
without regard to any performance-based vesting criteria applicable to such
Weyerhaeuser PSU relating to Weyerhaeusers relative total shareholder return
and (B) by assuming that any other performance-based vesting criteria
applicable to such Weyerhaeuser PSU were satisfied (1) at target level
immediately prior to the Distribution, in the event the Distribution occurs
prior to the determination of such performance by the Board of Directors of
Weyerhaeuser (or, if appropriate, any committee administering
the Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans) with respect to such awards or (2) based on
actual performance, in the event the Distribution occurs on or following such
determination of such performance with respect to such awards) by the Option
Exchange Ratio (each, as so granted, a " _Substituted WRECO PSU_ "); and

(v) immediately prior to the Distribution, each outstanding grant of
restricted stock units with respect to Weyerhaeuser Common Shares granted
under the Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans held by a Rollover Employee (each, a "
_Weyerhaeuser RSU_ ") shall be surrendered to Weyerhaeuser in exchange for a
grant of time-vesting restricted stock units by WRECO, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Weyerhaeuser RSU, with respect to the
number of WRECO Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole
share), determined by multiplying the number of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares
subject to such Weyerhaeuser RSU by the Option Exchange Ratio (each, as so
granted, a " _Substituted WRECO RSU_ ").

 

(b) A holder of a Substituted WRECO Option may not exercise such Substituted
WRECO Option until the Effective Time.

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent and
the Board of Directors of WRECO shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to effect the following:

(i) as of the Effective Time, each outstanding Substituted WRECO Option shall
cease to represent a right to acquire WRECO Common Shares and shall be
converted into a right to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Substituted WRECO Option prior to the Effective Time,
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of WRECO
Common Shares subject to such Substituted WRECO Option (each Substituted WRECO
Option, once converted into an option in respect of Parent Common Stock, a "
_Substituted Parent Option_ ");

 



67 (ii) as of the Effective Time, each outstanding grant of Substituted WRECO
PSUs shall be converted into a grant of time-vesting restricted stock units,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Substituted
WRECO PSU prior to the Effective Time, with respect to that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of WRECO Common Shares subject to
such Substituted WRECO PSU (each Substituted WRECO PSU grant, once converted
into a grant in respect of Parent Common Stock, a " _Substituted Parent PSU_
"); and

 

(iii) as of the Effective Time, each outstanding grant of Substituted WRECO
RSUs shall be converted into a grant of time-vesting restricted stock units,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Substituted
WRECO RSU prior to the Effective Time, with respect to that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of WRECO Common Shares subject to
such Substituted WRECO RSU (each Substituted WRECO RSU grant, once converted
into a grant in respect of Parent Common Stock, a " _Substituted Parent RSU_
").

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Substituted Parent
Options, Substituted Parent PSUs and Substituted Parent RSUs (collectively,
the " _Parent Equity Awards_ "), with the result that all obligations of WRECO
with respect to Substituted WRECO Options, Substituted WRECO PSUs and
Substituted WRECO RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be obligations of Parent as of the Effective Time.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Substituted Parent Options, Substituted Parent PSUs
and Substituted Parent RSUs appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights with respect to, and instruments evidencing the grant or assumption of,
such Substituted Parent Options, Substituted Parent PSUs and Substituted
Parent RSUs. Such Substituted Parent Options, Substituted Parent PSUs and
Substituted Parent RSUs, shall, except as provided in Section 9.07(a)(iv) with
respect to Substituted WRECO PSUs, continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions as the terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Weyerhaeuser Stock Plans.

 

SECTION 9.08. _Benefit Plans_. (a) _Prior Service Credit_. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to,
give to each WRECO Employee full credit for all purposes (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, early retirement eligibility and early
retirement subsidies, vesting and, except with respect to defined
benefit pension plans, benefit accrual) under any Employee Benefit Plan
provided, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for
such WRECO Employees service with Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Distribution.

 

(b) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits_. For the one-year period
immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall, and shall

 



68  cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, provide to each WRECO Employee (i) base
salary and bonus and incentive compensation opportunities that are no less
favorable than those provided to such WRECO Employee as of immediately prior
to the Distribution and (ii) other employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such WRECO
Employee as of immediately prior to the Distribution. 

(c) _WRECO Benefit Plans and Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plans_. Effective on or
prior to the Distribution Date, (i) WRECO shall, or shall cause the
applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities with respect to each
WRECO Benefit Plan and (ii) except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, each WRECO Employee shall cease active participation in each
Weyerhaeuser REB Benefit Plan. In accordance with and without limiting the
generality of Section 9.08(b), from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, administer each WRECO
Benefit Plan in all material respects in accordance with its terms. Nothing
in this Section 9.08(c) shall limit the ability of Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries, WRECO or the WRECO Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any
WRECO Benefit Plan at any time, in accordance with its terms.

(d) _Cash Incentive Bonus Plans_. Without limiting the generality of Section
9.08(c), effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, WRECO shall, or
shall cause the applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities with
respect to the WRECO Employees under each Weyerhaeuser Employee Benefit Plan
that is a cash-based bonus or incentive compensation plan set forth in
Section 9.08(d) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "
_WRECO Employee Incentive Plans_ "). From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, maintain the WRECO
Employee Incentive Plans pursuant to their terms as in effect as of the
Effective Time and make payments to the WRECO Employees at the times
prescribed thereunder with respect to the WRECO fiscal year in which
the Effective Time occurs (and, to the extent such payments have not been
made as of the Effective Time, with respect to the WRECO fiscal year prior to
the WRECO fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs).

 

(e) _Retention Arrangements_. Without limiting the generality of Section
9.08(c), effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, WRECO shall, or
shall cause the applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities with
respect to the WRECO Employees under each Weyerhaeuser Employee Benefit Plan
(i) that is a retention plan set forth in Section 9.08(e)(i) of
the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter, together with all individual awards and
agreements with any WRECO Employee with respect thereto, or (ii) that is an
individual retention letter agreement with any WRECO Employee materially
consistent with the form of retention letter agreement set forth in Section
9.08(e)(ii) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter, including, in each case,
any such awards or agreements entered into after the date hereof not in
contravention of this Agreement (the plans, awards and agreements in clauses
(i) and (ii), collectively, the " _WRECO Employee Retention Arrangements_ ").
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries to, maintain the WRECO Employee Retention Arrangements pursuant
to their terms as in effect as of the Effective Time and make payments to the
WRECO Employees at the times prescribed thereunder.

 



69 (f) _Certain Welfare Benefits Matters_.

 

(i) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.08(b), as of immediately
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries to, have in effect Employee Benefit Plans that are "employee
welfare benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
(collectively, " _New Welfare Plans_ ") that will provide welfare benefits to
WRECO Employees (and any dependents and beneficiaries thereof). Parent shall,
and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, (A) waive all limitations as to
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the WRECO Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries under
the New Welfare Plans to the extent waived under the applicable
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Weyerhaeuser
or the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Distribution (each,
a " _Weyerhaeuser Welfare Plan_ ") and (B) provide each WRECO Employee and his
or her eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit under New Welfare
Plans for any co-payments and deductibles paid under corresponding
Weyerhaeuser Welfare Plans prior to the Effective Time in the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements (and any annual and lifetime
maximums) under any New Welfare Plans in which such WRECO Employee
participates.

 

(ii) Effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, WRECO shall, or shall
cause the applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities of
Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries to WRECO Employees and their
eligible dependents in respect of health insurance under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Sections 601 _et_
_seq._ and Sections 701 _et_ _seq._ of ERISA, Section 4980B and Sections 9801
_et_ _seq._ of the Code and applicable state or similar Law.

(iii) From and after the Distribution Date, Weyerhaeuser shall retain all
Liabilities in accordance with the Weyerhaeuser Welfare Plans for payment of
all medical, dental, vision, health, non-occupational short-term disability
benefit and long-term disability benefit claims (collectively, " _Welfare
Benefit Claims_ ") incurred under such plans prior to the Distribution Date
with respect to any WRECO Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
and WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries shall not assume any Liability with
respect to such Welfare Benefit Claims, except that WRECO shall assume
Liability for such Welfare Benefit Claims to the extent required by applicable
Law or to the extent such Welfare Benefit Claims (A) are incurred under any
WRECO Benefit Plan or (B) are insured under an insurance policy in respect
of which (1) WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary (or, as of the Effective Time,
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary) becomes the beneficiary or (2) a WRECO
Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) is the beneficiary and such
insurance policy transfers with such WRECO Employee pursuant to applicable
Law to WRECO or any WRECO Subsidiary as of the Distribution Date or to Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary as of the Effective Time. WRECO and the WRECO
Subsidiaries shall be liable for payment of all Welfare Benefit Claims
incurred on or after the Distribution Date with respect to any WRECO Employee

 



70  (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) and, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, cause all such
Welfare Benefit Claims to be assumed by and administered under the New
Welfare Plans. For purposes of the foregoing, a claim shall be deemed to be
incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment, and
business travel accident insurance benefits and long-term disability
benefits, upon the death, disability or accident giving rise to such benefits,
(ii) health, dental and prescription drug benefits (including in respect of
any hospital confinement), upon provision of such services, materials
or supplies, and (iii) non-occupational short-term disability benefits, upon
the initiation of any claim for such benefit payment.

 

(iv) From and after the Distribution Date, Weyerhaeuser shall retain Liability
for all claims for payment of all claims for workers compensation benefits
that are incurred prior to the Distribution Date with respect to any WRECO
Employee, except that WRECO shall assume Liability for such claims to the
extent required by applicable Law or to the extent such claims relate to any
WRECO Benefit Plan. WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries shall be liable for
payment of all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on
or after the Distribution Date with respect to any WRECO Employee. A claim for
workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event
giving rise to the claim (the " _Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs. If the
Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following
the Distribution Date, the claim shall be the joint Liability of
Weyerhaeuser, on the one hand, and WRECO (and, effective as of the Effective
Time, Parent), on the other hand, and shall be equitably apportioned between
such parties based upon the relative periods of time that the Workers
Compensation Event transpired preceding and following the Distribution Date.

 

(g) _Tax-Qualified Savings/401(k) Plan_.

 

(i) Effective not later than the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Parent Subsidiaries to, have in effect one or more defined contribution
plans that include a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning
of Section 401(k) of the Code (and a related trust exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code) (as applicable, the " _New 401(k) Plan_ "). Each
WRECO Employee participating in a defined contribution plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code sponsored by Weyerhaeuser or the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Distribution (each, a " _Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan_ ")
shall become a participant in the corresponding New 401(k) Plan as of the
Effective Time and each WRECO Employee shall be eligible to participate in a
New 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time.

(ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Parent Subsidiaries to,
cause the New 401(k) Plan to accept a "direct rollover" to such New 401(k)
Plan of the account balances of each WRECO Employee (including promissory
notes evidencing all outstanding loans) under a Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan in
which such WRECO Employee participates, if such direct rollover is elected in
accordance with applicable Law and the terms of the Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan
by such WRECO Employee.

 



71 (h) _Accrued Vacation_. Effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, WRECO
shall, or shall cause the applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to, assume Liability
for all vacation days (regular, supplemental or banked) accrued or earned but
not yet taken by each WRECO Employee as of the Distribution Date (the "
_Accrued Vacation Days_ "). In the event that a WRECO Employee is entitled
under applicable Law or any policy of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary to be paid for any Accrued Vacation Days on or after the
Distribution Date, (i) WRECO or the applicable WRECO Subsidiary or, solely to
the extent required by applicable Law (as reasonably determined by
Weyerhaeuser), Weyerhaeuser or the applicable Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, shall
pay any required amounts to such WRECO Employee, (ii) such amounts, whether
or not paid by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, shall be REB
Liabilities and (iii) to the extent any such amounts are paid by Weyerhaeuser
or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary, Weyerhaeuser or the applicable
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 12.03(a). Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, honor all the Accrued Vacation Days for
which payout is not made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

(i) _Flexible Spending Account Plans_. Effective not later than the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, have in effect
flexible spending arrangements under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section
125 of the Code (the " _New Flexible Spending Account Plan_ "), and from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall be liable for all Liabilities and
account balances of the Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending Account Plan maintained
in the United States with respect to WRECO Employees and their dependents
(the " _Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending Account Plan_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, all claims for reimbursement which have not been paid as of
the Distribution Date and credited under the New Flexible Spending Account
Plan shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of the New Flexible
Spending Account Plan. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
(i) Weyerhaeuser shall, or shall cause the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries to,
transfer to Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary an amount in cash
equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate contributions to the
Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending Account Plan made by WRECO Employees prior to
the Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs over
the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to WRECO Employees prior to the
Effective Time for such year from such plan and (ii) Parent shall, or shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, cause such amounts to be credited to each
such WRECO Employees accounts under the New Flexible Spending Account Plan.
In connection with such transfer, Parent shall deem that such employees
deferral elections made under the Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending Account Plan
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs shall continue in effect
under the New Flexible Spending Account Plan for the remainder of the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs. If the aggregate reimbursement
payouts made to WRECO Employees from the Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending
Account Plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions made by
the WRECO Employees to such plan prior to the Effective Time for such plan
year, Parent shall make a payment equal to the value of such excess to
Weyerhaeuser as soon as practicable following Parents receipt of additional
contributions from the applicable WRECO Employee.

 



72 (j) _No Benefit Plan Transfers_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, other than as a result of (i) direct rollovers from the
Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan to the New 401(k) Plan, to the extent such direct
rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of the
Weyerhaeuser 401(k) Plan by the applicable WRECO Employee, (ii) transfers
from the Weyerhaeuser Flexible Spending Account Plan to the New Flexible
Spending Account Plan or (iii) the transfer of the assets of or relating to
any WRECO Benefit Plan pursuant to the REB Transfers, there shall be no
transfer of assets from any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by
Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary to any Employee Benefit Plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries.

 

(k) _Severance_. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.08(c), effective
on or prior to the Distribution Date, WRECO shall, or shall cause the
applicable WRECO Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities with respect to the
REB Employees under each Weyerhaeuser Employee Benefit Plan (i) that is a
change in control plan set forth in Section 9.08(k)(i) of the Weyerhaeuser
Disclosure Letter, together with all individual awards and agreements with any

Section 9.08(k)(ii) of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter, together with all
individual awards and agreements with any REB Employee with respect thereto,

contemplated by Section 1.08(a) and any termination of any REB Employees
employment that occurs at or following the consummation of the Transactions,

Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, provide to
each WRECO Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period with severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided
to such WRECO Employee in the event of a termination of employment under the
applicable severance plan of Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries as
in effect with respect to such WRECO Employee as of the Distribution Date
(including any severance benefits under any REB Employee Severance

Liabilities under the Weyerhaeuser Pension Plan, the Weyerhaeuser Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Weyerhaeuser Salaried Employees Retirement Plan,
and Weyerhaeuser shall make payments to WRECO Employees with vested rights
thereunder in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and applicable
Law, as in effect from time to time. As of the Distribution Date, each WRECO
Employee shall cease active participation in such plans. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cooperate with and provide information to
Weyerhaeuser as necessary to permit Weyerhaeuser to satisfy its obligations
with respect to WRECO Employees who participated in any such plans on or
prior to the Distribution Date.

Distribution Date that arise out of the operation or conduct of the Real
Estate Business or the employment by Weyerhaeuser or the Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries of any REB Employee or any former employee of WRECO or any WRECO
Subsidiary. From and after the Distribution Date, WRECO and the WRECO
Subsidiaries (and, effective as of the Effective Time, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries) shall be liable for all employment and employee benefits-
related Liabilities incurred after the Distribution Date that arise out of
the operation or conduct of the Real Estate Business or the employment by
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries of any WRECO Employee.

applicable Law) and obtaining any Governmental Approvals required hereunder.

(p) _Form S-8_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of

"employment loss" (as defined in WARN) experienced by any REB Employee during
the 90-day period prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall not, and shall cause
the Parent Subsidiaries not to, take any action after the Effective Time that
would cause any termination of employment of any employees by Weyerhaeuser or
any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary that occurs on

 



74  or before the Effective Time to constitute a "plant closing" or a "mass
layoff" or a "group termination" under WARN or create any Liability or penalty

terminations under applicable Law.

SECTION 9.09. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification; Liability

occurring in connection with any of the Transaction Documents or the

SECTION 9.15.  _Covenants of Parent Regarding Non-Solicitation_. (a) Parent

or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, the
making of any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any confidential information with respect to, any Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and direct
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, in
response to an unsolicited written Parent Acquisition Proposal, if the Board
of Directors of Parent determines, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, Parent may
(and may authorize and permit the Parent Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 9.15(c), (1) furnish
information with respect to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Parent Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions
substantially similar to those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and
(2) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such
Parent Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Parent
Acquisition Proposal. In the event that, pursuant to clause (1) of
the foregoing sentence, Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives furnishes to a Person making a Parent Acquisition
Proposal (or its Representatives) any non-public information with respect to
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that has not previously been furnished to
Weyerhaeuser or its Representatives, Parent shall furnish all such information
to Weyerhaeuser substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to
such Person.

 

(b) Parent agrees that neither its Board of Directors nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Weyerhaeuser or WRECO), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify
in a manner adverse to the other party), the recommendation by the Board of
Directors of Parent to the holders of Parent Common Stock that they give

recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit
Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Parent Acquisition Proposal, other than any confidentiality agreement entered
into in accordance with Section 9.15(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to compliance with
the following sentence, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval the Board of Directors of Parent may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change following a determination by the Board of Directors of Parent that a
Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal. At least
five Business Days prior to the making of any Adverse Recommendation Change
by the Board of Directors of Parent pursuant to the foregoing sentence,
Parent shall provide Weyerhaeuser and WRECO written notice (a " _Notice of
Parent Superior Proposal_ ") advising Weyerhaeuser and WRECO that Parents
Board of Directors

 



77  intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including
the material terms and conditions of the Parent Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors of Parent (it being
understood and agreed that (A) any amendment to the financial terms of such
Parent Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Parent Superior
Proposal and a new five Business Day period and (B) in determining whether to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of Parent shall
take into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Weyerhaeuser or WRECO in response to a Notice of Parent
Superior Proposal or otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Parent
Superior Proposal is received less than five Business Days prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, then the five Business Day period contemplated above
shall be shortened such that it will expire as of the close of business on
the day preceding the Parent Stockholders Meeting, unless the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is postponed.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in Sections 9.15(a) and
9.15(b), Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, advise Weyerhaeuser and
WRECO orally and in writing of the receipt of any Parent Acquisition Proposal

Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall keep Weyerhaeuser and WRECO reasonably
informed of any material developments with respect to any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto).

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 9.15 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Parent from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if its Board of
Directors (after consultation with its outside counsel) determines that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, it being understood, however, that this clause (ii) shall not
be deemed to permit its Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change except, in each case, to the extent permitted by Section 9.15(b).

SECTION 9.16.  _Covenants of Weyerhaeuser Regarding Non-Solicitation_.
Weyerhaeuser shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take
any other action to knowingly facilitate, the making of any proposal that
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an REB Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any confidential information
with respect to, any REB Acquisition Proposal or (iii) execute or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to
any REB Acquisition Proposal. Weyerhaeuser shall, and shall cause the
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries and direct their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any REB
Acquisition Proposal.

368(a) of the Code, (iii) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement will
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of

the Intended Tax Treatment (it being understood that no party will be required
to agree to any such amendment that it determines in good faith materially
adversely affects the value of the Transactions to such party or its
stockholders) and (3) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
opinions referred to in Sections 10.02(e) and 10.03(f), including by
executing customary letters of representation.

respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, the Weyerhaeuser Merger
Tax Opinion and the Parent Merger Tax Opinion in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Weyerhaeuser and Parent, respectively.

SECTION 9.18. _Replacement of Guarantees_. At or as soon as
practicable following the Closing, Parent shall provide, or cause a Parent
Subsidiary to provide, replacement Guarantees with respect to each of the
Guarantees set forth in Section 9.18 of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter and
each other Guarantee issued prior to the Effective Time with the prior
written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other
than WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries) for the benefit of WRECO or any WRECO
Subsidiary or with respect to any REB Liability or the Real Estate Business,
in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Weyerhaeuser and
the respective banks, insurance companies or other
counterparties. Weyerhaeuser, WRECO and Parent shall cooperate to obtain any
necessary release of such Guarantees issued by Weyerhaeuser or any
Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Weyerhaeuser and Parent. In the event that any such Guarantees are not
replaced at the Closing, Parent shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for any interest
or other expenses paid by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary on or
after the Closing Date with respect thereto.

Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries) or to
assume, or cause a Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (other than WRECO and the WRECO
Subsidiaries) to assume, some or all of the Assumed Excluded Liabilities, in
each case at any time prior to close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the REB Transfer Time and (ii) any such transfer to be
effected as a distribution by WRECO to WNR or as a repayment by WRECO of a
portion of the Intercompany Debt outstanding at such time.

 

(b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that, subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the transfer of the
Transferred Excluded Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Excluded
Liabilities shall be structured in such a way that such transfers and
assumptions shall neither benefit nor burden Parent and the Surviving
Corporation.

Subsidiary. For the purposes of this Section 9.23, the placement of "help

commercially reasonable efforts to enforce in accordance with its terms any
confidentiality agreement between Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any third Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates),

the Real Estate Business after the Closing, Parent and Weyerhaeuser shall
negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of a transition services
agreement providing for Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries to
deliver, for a period of up to three months, corporate-level services that are
currently provided by Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries (other
than WRECO and the WRECO Subsidiaries) to the Real Estate Business and that
the parties determine to be reasonably necessary to effect an orderly
transition of the Real Estate Business, except that the transition
services agreement shall not include any insurance, legal, tax, accounting or

 _Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

 

SECTION 11.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of each party hereto;

 

(b) by either Weyerhaeuser or Parent:

 

(i) if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before the date that is 12
months after the date hereof, unless the failure to consummate the
Transactions is the result of a material breach of any Transaction Document by
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the passage of such period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which
any party shall be subject to a non-final Judgment restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions;

 

(ii) if the Parent Stockholder Approval has not been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at the Parent Stockholders Meeting;

(iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
shall have issued a Judgment that permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits the consummation of the Transactions, and any such Judgment shall
have become final and non-appealable; or

 

(iv) if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted a Law that prohibits or
makes illegal the consummation of the Transactions; or

(c) by Weyerhaeuser:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained in any Transaction
Document, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b) and (B)
cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written
notice to Parent of such breach, unless Weyerhaeuser or WRECO is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any
Transaction Document; or

 

(ii) if the Board of Directors of Parent makes an Adverse Recommendation
Change; or

 



85 (d) by Parent, if Weyerhaeuser or WRECO breaches or fails to perform in any
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in any
Transaction Document, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b) and
(B) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to Weyerhaeuser of such breach, unless Parent or Merger Sub is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in any Transaction Document.

 

SECTION 11.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 11.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of
Weyerhaeuser, WRECO, Parent and Merger Sub, other than Sections 6.19, 7.17,
9.03(e), 9.10, 9.14(b), 11.03 and 11.04, this Section 11.02 and Article XIII,
which provisions shall survive such termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to Section 11.04, a termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages resulting from the
willful and material breach by such party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

 

SECTION 11.03. _Termination Fees_. (a) If:

 

(i) Weyerhaeuser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(ii);
or

 

(ii) either Parent or Weyerhaeuser terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.01(b)(ii) or pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i) in circumstances
where the Parent Stockholder Approval has not been obtained at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, and (A) (1) in the case of a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i), a Parent Acquisition Proposal has
been made prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting and not withdrawn more
than five days prior to the vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock or (2)
in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(b)(ii), a Parent Acquisition Proposal has been made that is either
publicly disclosed or otherwise becomes publicly known prior to or at the time
of the Parent Stockholders Meeting and that is not withdrawn more than five
days prior to the vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock and (B) Parent
enters into an agreement with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or
any Parent Acquisition Proposal is consummated, after the date hereof and
prior to the expiration of 12 months following termination of this Agreement,

then in any such case Parent shall pay to Weyerhaeuser $20,000,000, _less_
any amounts paid by Parent to Weyerhaeuser pursuant to Section 11.03(b)) (the
" _Parent Termination Fee_ ") in immediately available funds to an account
designated by Weyerhaeuser. Such payment shall be due (x) in the case of a
termination specified in clause (i), within five Business Days after written
notice of termination by Weyerhaeuser or (y) in the case of a termination
specified in clause (ii), at or prior to the earlier of the entering into of
the agreement and the consummation of the transaction referred to therein.
Parent shall not be obligated to make more than one payment pursuant to this
Section 11.03(a).

 



86 (b) If a Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 11.03(a) or if
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Weyerhaeuser pursuant to
Section 11.01(b)(ii) or pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i) in circumstances where
the Parent Stockholder Approval has not been obtained at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, then Parent shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for its out-
of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions and not otherwise reimbursed pursuant to Section 9.14(b). Such
reimbursement shall be paid (i) concurrently with payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, if a Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section
11.03(a) or (ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
11.01(b)(ii) or pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i) in circumstances where the
Parent Stockholder Approval has not been obtained at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, prior to the termination of this Agreement by Parent or within five
Business Days after written notice of termination by Weyerhaeuser, as the
case may be. Parent shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in excess of
$10,000,000 pursuant to this Section 11.03(b).

 

SECTION 11.04. _Effect of Termination Fee Payment_. The parties hereto agree
that if Parent pays to Weyerhaeuser the amounts required by Sections 11.03(a)
and 11.03(b) as a result of the occurrence of any of the events referenced in
Section 11.03(a) or 11.03(b), Weyerhaeuser and WRECO shall have no other
remedy for monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub, except as set forth in Section 9.14(b).

SECTION 11.05. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time. Any amendment to this Agreement shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto may, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

SECTION 11.07. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.05 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 11.06 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of any of
the parties hereto, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized
designee of its Board of Directors. After the Parent Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.05 that
by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of Parent shall be
effective only with the approval of such stockholders. After the consummation
of the Distribution, any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.05
that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of WRECO shall be
effective only with the approval of such shareholders.

SECTION 12.04. _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) _Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. If any party (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any Action or the
assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or
assessment for which indemnity may be sought under Section 12.02 or 12.03 (a
" _Third Party Claim_ "), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
pursuant to this Article XII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the
other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written notice of such Third
Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent
known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party
Claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified
Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall actively pursue such defense in good faith, (ii) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost

 



90  and expense (except as contemplated by the following sentence) and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (iii) the Indemnified
Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iv) the Indemnifying
Party shall not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement provides for (x) relief other
than money damages or (y) money damages if the Indemnifying Party has not
acknowledged in writing that it shall be responsible for such money damages,
in the case each of clauses (A) and (B), without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party reasonably agree that a conflict of interest exists in
respect of a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to retain separate counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified
Party in the defense of the Third Party Claim, and the reasonable legal fees
and expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Third Party
Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief other
than monetary damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be
separated from any related claim for monetary damages. Each party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party
Claims and shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against,
settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties shall also
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or
any judgment that was consented to by the Indemnified Party without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

(b)  _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any
matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim giving rise to the claim of
indemnity pursuant hereto. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from
receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist
the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity
by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such
assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and
copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters,
furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of
such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

 

SECTION 12.05. _Indemnification as Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to
Section 12.07(a), Weyerhaeuser, WRECO and Parent acknowledge and agree that,
following the consummation of the Distribution, Weyerhaeusers, WRECOs, and
Parents sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating
to Article I or II, the Real Estate Business, the

 



91  REB Assets, the Excluded Assets, the REB Liabilities, the Excluded
Liabilities, the REB Transfers, the WRECO Spin or the Distribution shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XII. In
furtherance of the foregoing and subject to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article XII, Weyerhaeuser, WRECO and Parent hereby waive, from
and after the Distribution Date, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action Weyerhaeuser or any other Weyerhaeuser Indemnitee, on the one hand, and
Parent, WRECO or any other WRECO Indemnitee, on the other hand, may have
against Parent, WRECO or any of their respective Affiliates or,
respectively, Weyerhaeuser or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
Representatives arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise (including
with respect to environmental matters generally and any matters under
Environmental Laws). This Section 12.05 will not apply to any breach
following the Distribution Date of any other Section of this Agreement or the
Tax Sharing Agreement.

SECTION 12.06. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. (a) The amount of any
Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article XII shall be net
of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies
with respect to such Loss.

(b) An Indemnifying Party is authorized, in connection with payment of any
Loss for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party under
this Article XII, to set off and apply any and all payments due to such
Indemnifying Party under Article V or this Article XII against any of and all
of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party under
this Article XII. The rights of the Indemnifying Party under this Section
12.06(b) are in addition (but without duplication) to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of set-off) which such Indemnifying Party
may have.

SECTION 12.07. _Additional Matters_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, indemnification for Tax matters shall be governed
solely and exclusively by the terms, provisions and procedures of the Tax
Sharing Agreement and not by this Article XII.

 

(b) In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for special, punitive,
exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, or lost profits,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise,
except to the extent that such damages are actually payable by the Indemnified
Party in connection with a Third Party Claim.

Transaction Document and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
each Transaction Document in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
provided that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery

entitled at law or in equity.

 

SECTION 13.11. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, provided that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any federal court located in

Transaction Document or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to any Transaction Document or any Transaction in any court other

sitting in the State of Delaware and (d) waives any right to trial by jury

cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions, including with respect to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the New Debt Commitment Letter, the New Debt or the

of action, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the New
Debt Commitment Letter, the New Debt or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
Laws of another jurisdiction and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the
New Debt Commitment Letter, the New Debt or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby. The Financing Sources are intended third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 13.11.

voting rights of any class of the capital stock of Parent.

(b) Stockholder shall not commit or agree to take any action inconsistent
with any provision of Section 3.01(a).

SECTION 3.02. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to,
and appoints, Weyerhaeuser, and any individual designated in writing by
Weyerhaeuser, and each of them individually, as Stockholders proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place
and stead of Stockholder, to vote the Subject Shares, or grant a consent or
approval in respect of the Subject Shares, in a manner consistent with Section
3.01. Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Weyerhaeuser is entering
into the Transaction Agreement in reliance upon Stockholders execution and
delivery of this Agreement. Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable
proxy set forth in this Section 3.02 is given in connection with the execution
of the Transaction Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to
secure the performance of the duties of Stockholder under this Agreement.
Stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with
an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked. Stockholder hereby
ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause
to be done by virtue hereof. Such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended

Subject Shares to any Person, (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether
by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to any Subject Shares

action that would make any representation or warranty of Stockholder contained
herein untrue or incorrect or would restrict, limit or interfere with the

to restrict Stockholders right to Transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock

all existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval,
Stockholder may (and may authorize and permit Guarantor and their respective
controlled Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to) furnish
such information to, and participate in such discussions and negotiations
with, a Person (other than Stockholder, Guarantor or any of their respective
Affiliates) making a Parent Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) to
the same extent that Parent is permitted to do so pursuant to Section 9.15 of
the Transaction Agreement. In the event that, pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, Stockholder, Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates or any
of their respective Representatives furnishes to a Person making a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (or its Representatives) any non-public information that
has not previously been furnished to Weyerhaeuser or its Representatives,
Stockholder shall furnish all such information to Weyerhaeuser substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person. Stockholder shall,
as promptly as practicable, advise Weyerhaeuser orally and in writing of the
receipt of any Parent Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof, the material

public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law or court process, in which case Stockholder shall, and

provisions shall survive such termination and (B) liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination.

Stockholder is a married individual and the Subject Shares of such
Stockholder constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other
approval for this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of, such Stockholders spouse, enforceable against
such spouse in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally or by principles
governing the availability of equitable remedies). If such Stockholder is a
trust, no trust of which such Stockholder is a trustee requires the consent of

delivery by such Stockholder of this Agreement do not, and the compliance by
such Stockholder with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default (or an event that, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any Person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of such Stockholder under, any
provision of (i) any Contract to which such Stockholder is a party or by which
any of his or its properties or assets is bound or (ii) subject to the
filings and other matters referred to in Section 2.04(b), any Judgment or Law
applicable to such Stockholder or his or its properties or assets, other than,
in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, any such item that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would not reasonably be
expected to be material and adverse to the ability of such Stockholder to
perform his or its obligations hereunder.

 

(a) No Governmental Approval is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to such Stockholder in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, other than compliance by such Stockholder with
and filings under Sections 13(d) and 16 of the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 2.05. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
such Stockholder, any claim that has been asserted against or affecting such
Stockholder with respect to an Action (and such Stockholder is not aware of
any basis for any such Action or claim), nor is there any Judgment outstanding
against such Stockholder or to which any of his or its properties or
assets is subject that, individually or in the aggregate, has been or would
reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to the ability of such

Agreement or any of the Transactions is sought, such Stockholder shall vote,
or cause to be voted, the Subject Shares of such Stockholder in favor

the capital stock of Parent.

 

(b) The Stockholders shall not commit or agree to take any action inconsistent
with any provision of Section 3.01(a).

 

SECTION 3.02. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants
to, and appoints, Weyerhaeuser, and any individual designated in writing by
Weyerhaeuser, and each of them individually, as such Stockholders proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place
and stead of such Stockholder, to vote the Subject Shares of such
Stockholder, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such Subject Shares,
in a manner consistent with Section 3.01. Each Stockholder understands and
acknowledges that Weyerhaeuser is entering into the Transaction Agreement in
reliance upon such Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement.
Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 3.02 is given in connection with the execution of the Transaction
Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance
of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Each Stockholder
hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest
and may under no circumstances be revoked. Each Stockholder hereby ratifies
and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue hereof. Such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be
irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 212(e) of the DGCL.
Each Stockholder shall, upon written request by Weyerhaeuser, as promptly as
practicable execute and deliver to Weyerhaeuser a separate written instrument
or proxy that embodies the terms of this irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 3.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proxy and appointment granted
hereby shall be automatically revoked, without any action by any Stockholder,
upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.10.

Agreement, each Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) sell,

A-15  otherwise dispose of (including by gift), hedge or utilize a derivative to
transfer the economic interest in (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), or enter
into any Contract, option or other arrangement or understanding (including
any profit sharing agreement) with respect to the Transfer of, any Subject
Shares to any Person, (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by
proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to any Subject Shares that
conflicts or is inconsistent with this Agreement, (iii) take any other action
that would make any representation or warranty of the Stockholders contained
herein untrue or incorrect or would restrict, limit or interfere with the
performance of the Stockholders obligations hereunder or (iv) commit or agree
to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

SECTION 3.04. _Non-Solicitation_. Each Stockholder shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of his or its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, the making of any
proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any confidential information with respect to, any Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Each Stockholder shall, and shall cause his or its Affiliates and
direct their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval,
each Stockholder may (and may authorize and permit his or its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives to) furnish such information to, and
participate in such discussions and negotiations with, a Person (other than
such Stockholder or any of his or its Affiliates) making a Parent Acquisition
Proposal (and its Representatives) to the same extent that Parent
is permitted to do so pursuant to Section 9.15 of the Transaction Agreement.
In the event that, pursuant to the foregoing sentence, a Stockholder or any of
his or its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives furnishes to
a Person making a Parent Acquisition Proposal (or its Representatives) any
non-public information that has not previously been furnished to Weyerhaeuser
or its Representatives, such Stockholder shall furnish all such information to
Weyerhaeuser substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person. The Stockholders shall, as promptly as practicable, advise
Weyerhaeuser orally and in writing of the receipt of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof, the material terms and conditions of any such
Parent Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such
Parent Acquisition Proposal. The Stockholders shall keep Weyerhaeuser
reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any such
Parent Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto). Nothing
in this Section 3.04 shall be deemed to limit or affect any actions taken (or
omitted to be taken) by a Stockholder who is an individual in his capacity as
an officer or director of Parent to the extent such actions (or omissions)
would be permitted under and are taken in compliance with the Transaction
Agreement in such individuals capacity as an officer or director of Parent.

 

SECTION 3.05. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Each Stockholder shall, and
shall cause his or its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the parties to the Transaction Agreement in
doing, all things necessary or advisable to cause the matters set forth
on Exhibit D to the Transaction Agreement to occur on the Closing Date.

 



A-16 SECTION 3.06. _Public Announcements_. Each Stockholder shall, and shall cause
his or its Affiliates to, consult with Weyerhaeuser regarding any press
release or other public statement issued by the Stockholders or their
Affiliates with respect to the Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law or court process, in which case
such Stockholder shall, and shall cause his or its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with Weyerhaeuser
before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.

SECTION 4.02. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement

public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term

A-17  provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 4.03.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

SECTION 4.04. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together with the Transaction Agreement to the extent referenced

Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

 

SECTION 4.05. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and

of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

SECTION 4.06.  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or

in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf

SECTION 4.09. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, provided that

 



A-18  if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State

event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement in any court other than the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware and (iv) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action

 _Form of Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

 

[   ]

ARTICLE I.

 

The name of this corporation is:

 

[   ]

ARTICLE II.

 

The period of duration of this corporation shall be perpetual.

 

ARTICLE III.

The purpose for which this corporation is organized is to engage in any form
of financial, real estate, recreation, service or other business not contrary
to law.

 

ARTICLE IV.

1\. The aggregate number of shares which this corporation is authorized to
issue is 110,000,000 shares, consisting of 10,000,000 preferred shares having
a par value of $0.04 per share and 100,000,000 common shares having a par
value of $4.00 per share. Shares redeemed, purchased or otherwise reacquired,
or surrendered to this corporation on conversion, shall have the status of
authorized and unissued shares of the class of which they were a part when
initially issued and may be reissued as part of the same or a different
series of the same class of which they were a part when initially issued,
unless, as part of the action of the Board of Directors taken to create any
series, the Board of Directors restricts the right of reissuance, in
which case such restricted right will be operative.

2\. The Board of Directors is expressly vested with authority to divide the
preferred shares into series, each of which shall be so designated as to
distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and
classes. All preferred shares shall be identical except in each case as to the
following relative rights and preferences, as to which the Board of Directors
may fix and determine variations among the different series of each class:

(a) The rate of dividend; 

(b) Whether shares may be redeemed and, if so, the redemption price and the
terms and conditions of redemption; (c) The amount payable upon shares in the event of voluntary and involuntary
liquidation;

 

(d) Sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase of shares;

 

(e) The terms and conditions, if any, on which shares may be converted; and

 

(f) The voting rights, if any.

 

3\. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of the preferred shares
of each series and the common shares are as follows:

 

(a) Out of the funds of this corporation legally available for payment of
dividends, the holders of the preferred shares of each series shall be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors,
cumulative dividends at the rate determined by the Board of Directors for such
series, and no more. Dividends on the preferred shares shall accrue on a daily
basis from such date as may be fixed by the Board of Directors for any
series. Unless dividends at the rate prescribed for each series of preferred
shares shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment in full on
all outstanding preferred shares for all past dividend periods and the
current dividend period, no dividends shall be declared or paid upon any class
of shares ranking as to dividends subordinate to the preferred shares and no
sum or sums shall be set aside for the redemption of preferred shares of any
series (including any sinking fund payment therefor) or for the purchase,
redemption (including any sinking fund payment therefor) or other acquisition
for value of any class or series of shares ranking as to dividends or assets
on a parity with or subordinate to any such series of preferred shares.
Accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares shall not bear interest.

 

(b) Out of any funds of this corporation legally available for payment of
dividends and remaining after full cumulative dividends upon all series of
preferred shares then outstanding shall have been paid or set apart for
payment for all past dividend periods and the current dividend period, then,
and not otherwise, the Board of Directors may declare and pay or set apart for
payment dividends on the common shares, and the holders of preferred shares
shall not be entitled to share therein.

(c) In the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation of this corporation,
before any distribution of the assets shall be made to the holders of any
class of shares ranking as to assets subordinate to the preferred shares, the
holders of the preferred shares of each series shall be entitled to receive
out of the assets of this corporation available for distribution to its
shareholders the sum of (i) the amount per share determined by the Board of
Directors as provided in paragraph 2(c) of this Article IV, and (ii) the
amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, such sum
constituting the "preferential amount" for the preferred shares. If, in the
event of such liquidation, the assets of this corporation available for
distribution to its shareholders shall be insufficient to permit full payment
to the holders of the preferred shares of each series of their respective
preferential amounts, then such assets shall be distributed ratably among
such holders in proportion to their respective preferential amounts. If, in
the event of such liquidation, the holders of the preferred shares of each
series shall have received

 



B-2  full payment of their respective preferential amounts, the holders of the
common shares shall be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of the
preferred shares of each series, to share ratably in all remaining assets of
the corporation available for distribution to shareholders. None of the
consolidation or merger of this corporation with or into any other corporation
or corporations, the sale or lease of all or substantially all of the assets
of this corporation or the merger or consolidation of any other corporation
into and with this corporation shall be deemed to be a voluntary or
involuntary liquidation.

 

(d) The holders of preferred shares shall have no voting rights except as
provided by Washington statutes or by or pursuant to this Article IV.

(e) Subject to any applicable provision of law or this Article IV, this
corporation shall have the right to purchase, or otherwise reacquire, at
public or private sale or otherwise any shares of any class, except that no
preferred shares shall be purchased unless dividends on all preferred shares
have been declared and paid or set apart for payment in full for all past
dividend periods.

(f) Except as otherwise required by law, the holders of common shares of this
corporation shall be entitled to one vote per common share on all matters to
be voted on by this corporations shareholders. Subject to any rights granted
to preferred shares issued pursuant to this Article IV, all common shares of
this corporation shall have all of the rights ordinarily associated with
common shares.

4\. The Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the issuance
of shares of this corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized, without
first offering such shares to the shareholders of this corporation.

 

ARTICLE V.

Except as may otherwise be provided by the Board of Directors, no holder of
any shares of this corporation shall have any preemptive right to purchase,
subscribe for or otherwise acquire any securities of this corporation of any
class or kind now or hereafter authorized.

ARTICLE VI.

 

There shall be no cumulative voting of shares in this corporation.

 

ARTICLE VII.

Any corporate action that may be approved by a shareholder vote at a meeting
of the shareholders of this corporation may be approved without a meeting or a
vote if the corporate action is approved by a single consent or multiple
counterpart consents each in the form of an executed record delivered to this
corporation by (i) all shareholders entitled to vote on the corporate action
or (ii) shareholders holding of record, or otherwise entitled to vote, in the
aggregate not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to approve such corporate action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote on the corporate action were present and voted. This corporation shall
comply with any provisions of the Washington 

 



B-3  business corporation act that require notice by this corporation in
connection with shareholder consents being sought or obtained for the approval
of any corporate action. Approval of corporate action by execution of
shareholder consents pursuant to this Article VII has the effect of a vote at
a shareholders meeting.

ARTICLE VIII.

Any corporate action for which the Washington business corporation act, as
then in effect, would otherwise require approval by either a two-thirds vote
of the shareholders of the corporation or by a two-thirds vote of one or more
voting groups shall be deemed approved by the shareholders or the voting
group(s) if it is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of shares entitled to vote or, if approval by voting groups is
required, by the holders of a majority of shares within each voting group
entitled to vote separately. Notwithstanding this Article VIII, effect shall
be given to any other provision of these articles of incorporation that
specifically requires a greater vote for approval of any particular corporate
action.

 

ARTICLE IX.

The shareholders shall have the power to adopt, alter, amend or repeal
bylaws, and the Board of Directors shall have the same power except with
respect to bylaws for which shareholder approval is required by law.

 

ARTICLE X.

This corporation shall have at least one director, the actual number to be
fixed in accordance with this corporations bylaws.

ARTICLE XI.

To the fullest extent permitted by the Washington business corporation act, a
director of this corporation shall not be liable to this corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages for conduct of that director as a director.
Any amendment to or repeal of this Article XI shall not adversely affect any
right of a director of this corporation under this Article XI with respect to
any acts or omissions of that director occurring prior to amendment or repeal.

ARTICLE XII.

 

To the fullest extent permitted by this corporations bylaws and the
Washington business corporation act, this corporation shall indemnify each
person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is
involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any threatened,
pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether formal or
informal, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the
fact that he or she is or was a director of this corporation. The Board of
Directors shall be entitled to determine the terms of indemnification,
including advance of expenses, and to give effect thereto through the
adoption of bylaws, approval of agreements, or by any other manner approved by
the Board of Directors. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article XII shall
not adversely affect any right of an individual with respect to any right to
indemnification arising prior to such amendment or repeal.

 



B-4 Exhibit C

 

 _Form of Amended and Restated Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

 

OF

 

[   ]

SECTION 1

 

 _SHAREHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS  MEETINGS _

 

1.1 _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of the shareholders of this
corporation (the "Corporation") for the election of directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting
shall be held each year at the principal office of the Corporation, or at some
other place either within or without the State of Washington as designated by
the Board of Directors, on the day and at the time specified in Exhibit A,
which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, or on such
other day and time as may be set by the Board of Directors. If the
specified day is a Sunday or a legal holiday, then the meeting will take
place on the next business day at the same time or on such other day and time
as may be set by the Board of Directors.

 

1.2 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose
or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or a majority of the
Board of Directors, or any shareholder or shareholders holding in the
aggregate two thirds of the voting power of all shareholders. The meetings
shall be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors may prescribe,
or, if not held upon the request of the Board of Directors, at such time and
place as may be established by the President or by the Secretary in the
Presidents absence. Only business within the purpose or purposes described
in the meeting notice may be conducted.

1.3 _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of the place, date and time of the annual
shareholders meeting and notice of the place, date, time and purpose or
purposes of special shareholders meetings shall be delivered not less than 10
(or, if required by Washington law, 20) or more than 60 days before the date
of the meeting, (i) by tangible medium transmitted by mail, private carrier,
personal delivery, telephone, wire or wireless equipment which transmits a
facsimile of the notice, (ii) by electronic transmission in accordance with
applicable law, or (iii) in any other manner approved by law, by or at the
direction of the President or the Secretary, to each shareholder of record
entitled to notice of such meeting. Notice given in accordance with
the foregoing shall be effective when and as provided under applicable law.

1.4 _Waiver of Notice_. Except where expressly prohibited by law or the
Corporations articles of incorporation, notice of the place, date, time and
purpose or purposes of any shareholders meeting may be waived by any
shareholder at any time, either before or after the meeting. Such waiver may
be provided by the shareholder to the Corporation either (i) in an executed
and dated written record or (ii) if the Corporation has designated an address,
location or system to which such waiver may be electronically transmitted and
such waiver is electronically  transmitted to such designated address, location, or system, in an executed
and dated electronically transmitted record. Attendance at the meeting in
person or by proxy waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of
the meeting unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting. A shareholder
waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at a meeting that is
not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the
shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

 

1.5 _Shareholders  Action Without a Meeting_. Any action that may be taken at
a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting or a vote if (i)
the action is taken by a single consent or multiple counterpart consents of
all shareholders entitled to vote on the action and each such consent is in
the form of an executed record and delivered to the Corporation or (ii) the
action is taken by a single consent or multiple consents of shareholders
holding of record, or otherwise entitled to vote, in the aggregate not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to approve or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action
were present and voted, and each such consent is in the form of an executed
record and delivered to the Corporation. The Corporation shall comply with any
provisions of the Washington business corporation act that require notice by
the Corporation in connection with shareholder consents being sought or
obtained for approval of any corporation action. Any consent delivered to the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be inserted in the minute book
as if it were the minutes of a meeting of the shareholders and each consent
shall be (i) in an executed record or (ii) if the Corporation has designated
an address, location, or system to which the consent may be electronically
transmitted and the consent is electronically transmitted to the designated
address, location, or system, in an executed electronically transmitted
record.

 

1.6 _Telephone Meetings_. Shareholders may participate in a meeting of
shareholders by means of a conference telephone or any similar communications
equipment that enables all persons participating in the meeting to hear each
other during the meeting. Participation by such means shall constitute
presence in person at a meeting.

 

1.7 _List of Shareholders_. At least 10 days before any shareholders meeting,
the Secretary of the Corporation or the agent having charge of the share
transfer books of the Corporation shall have compiled a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order and by voting group, with the address of each shareholder
and the number, class, and series, if any, of shares owned by each.

1.8 _Quorum and Voting_. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of
a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter at a meeting shall
constitute a quorum of shareholders for that matter. If a quorum exists,
action on a matter shall be approved by a voting group if the votes
cast within a voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within
the voting group opposing the action, unless a greater number of affirmative
votes is required by the Corporations articles of incorporation or by law. If
the Corporations articles of incorporation or Washington law provide for
voting by two or more voting groups on a matter, action on a matter is taken
only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately. Action
may be taken by one voting group on a matter even though no action is taken
by another voting group.

 



C-2 1.9 _Adjourned Meetings_. If a shareholders meeting is adjourned to a
different place, date or time, whether for failure to achieve a quorum or
otherwise, notice need not be given of the new place, date or time if the new
place, date or time is announced at the meeting before adjournment. When a
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
has been made as provided in these bylaws, that determination shall apply to
any adjournment thereof, unless Washington law requires fixing a new record
date. If Washington law requires that a new record date be set for the
adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to
shareholders as of the new record date. Any business may be transacted at an
adjourned meeting that could have been transacted at the meeting as originally
called. 

1.10 _Proxies_. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for
the shareholder by (i) executing a writing authorizing another person or
persons to act for the shareholder as proxy or (ii) transmitting or
authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission which contains or
is accompanied by information from which it can be reasonably verified that
the transmission was authorized by the shareholder or by the shareholders
attorney-in-fact. The Corporation shall require the holders of proxies by
transmission to provide to the Corporation copies of the transmission and
the Corporation shall retain copies of the transmission for at least 60 days
after each shareholder vote or action where such proxy was exercised. The
appointment shall be valid for 11 months unless the appointment form expressly
provides for a longer period. An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless
the appointment is coupled with an interest. No revocation shall be effective
until written notice thereof has actually been received by the Secretary of
the Corporation or any other person authorized to tabulate votes.

1.11 _Fixing Record Date_. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as
the record date for determining shareholders entitled: (i) to notice of or to
vote at any shareholders meeting or any adjournment thereof; (ii) to receive
payment of any share dividend; or (iii) to receive payment of any
distribution. The Board of Directors may in addition fix record dates with
respect to any allotment of rights or conversion or exchange of any securities
by their terms, or for any other proper purpose, as determined by the Board of
Directors and by law. The record date shall be not more than 70 days and, in
case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days (or such longer
period as may be required by Washington law) prior to the date on which the
particular action requiring determination of shareholders is to be taken. If
no record date is fixed for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, the record date shall be the date
before the day on which notice of the meeting is delivered. If no record date
is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to a distribution
(other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the
Corporations own shares), the record date shall be the date on which the
Board adopted the resolution declaring the distribution. If no record date is
fixed for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend, the record
date shall be the date on which the Board of Directors authorized the
dividend.

 



C-3 SECTION 2

 

 _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

 

2.1 _Number and Qualification_. The business affairs and property of the
Corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors. The
number of directors of the Corporation is set forth in Exhibit A. The Board of
Directors may increase or decrease this number by resolution, but in no event
shall the actual number of directors be less than three (3). A decrease in
the number of directors shall not shorten the term of an incumbent director.

2.2 _Election; Term of Office_. The directors shall be elected by the
shareholders at each annual shareholders meeting or at a special
shareholders meeting called for such purpose. Despite the expiration of a
directors term, that director continues to serve until that directors
successor is elected and qualified or until there is a decrease in the
authorized number of directors.

2.3  _Vacancies_. Except as otherwise provided by law, vacancies in the Board
of Directors, whether caused by resignation, death, retirement,
disqualification, removal, increase in the number of directors, or otherwise,
may be filled for the remainder of the term by the Board of Directors, by the
shareholders, or, if the directors in office constitute less than a quorum of
the Board of Directors, by an affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
directors. The term of a director elected to fill a vacancy expires at the
next shareholders meeting at which directors are elected. A vacancy that will
occur at a specific later date may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but
the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

2.4 _Quorum and Voting_. At any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
presence in person (including presence by electronic means such as a
telephone conference call) of a majority of the number of directors presently
in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no case shall a quorum be less than one-
third of the authorized number of directors. If a quorum is present at the
time of a vote, the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at
the time of the vote shall be the act of the Board of Directors and of the
Corporation except as may be otherwise specifically provided by the
Corporations articles of incorporation, by these bylaws, or by law. A
director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors when action is
taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken unless: (i) the director
objects at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon the directors
arrival, to holding the meeting or to transacting business at the meeting;
(ii) the directors dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in
the minutes of the meeting; or (iii) the director delivers notice of the
directors dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting
before the adjournment of the meeting or to the Corporation within a
reasonable time after adjournment of the meeting. The right of dissent or
abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action
taken.

 

2.5 _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation shall be held immediately following the adjournment of the annual
meeting of the shareholders at the office of the Corporation, or at such other
place as may have been designated for the holding of the annual meeting of
shareholders pursuant to Section 1.1 hereof.

 



C-4 2.6 _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be
held at such place, date and time as shall from time to time be fixed by
resolution of the Board of Directors.

2.7 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
held at any place and at any time and may be called by the Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President, or any two or more directors.

 

2.8 _Notice of Meetings_. Unless the Corporations articles of incorporation
provide otherwise, any annual meeting or regular meeting of the Board of
Directors may be held without notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of
the meeting. Any special meeting of the Board of Directors must be preceded by
at least two days notice of the date, time, and place of the meeting, but not
of its purpose, unless the Corporations articles of incorporation or these
bylaws require otherwise. Notice may be given (i) orally, (ii) by tangible
medium transmitted by mail, private carrier, personal delivery,
telephone, wire or wireless equipment which transmits a facsimile of the
notice, (iii) by electronic transmission in accordance with applicable law, or
(iv) in any other manner allowed by law. Oral notice shall be sufficient only
if a record of such notice is included in the Corporations minute book.
Notice given in accordance with the foregoing shall be effective as provided
by applicable law. Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors may be
waived by any director at any time. The waiver shall be set forth either (i)
in an executed record or (ii) if the Corporation has designated an address,
location, or system to which waiver may be electronically transmitted and the
waiver is electronically transmitted to the designated address, location, or
system, in an executed electronically transmitted record. The waiver shall be
delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes, either before or
after the meeting. Attendance or participation by a director at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of any required notice of the meeting unless the
director promptly objects to holding the meeting or to the transaction of any
business on the grounds that the meeting was not lawfully convened and the
director does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the
meeting.

2.9 _Directors  Action Without A Meeting_. The Board of Directors or a
committee thereof may take any action without a meeting that it could properly
take at a meeting if one or more consents setting forth the action are
executed by all of the directors, or all of the members of the committee, as
the case may be, either before or after the action is taken, and if the
consents are delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or
filing with the corporate records. Consents shall be set forth either (i) in
an executed record or (ii) if the Corporation has designated an address,
location, or system to which the consent may be electronically transmitted and
the consent is electronically transmitted to the designated address, location,
or system, in an executed electronically transmitted record. Such action
shall be effective when the last director executes the consent, unless the
consent specifies a later effective date.

 

2.10 _Committees of the Board of Directors_. The Board of Directors, by
resolutions adopted by a majority of the directors in office, may create from
among its members one or more committees and shall appoint the members
thereof. Each such committee must have two or more members, who shall be
directors and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. Each
committee of the Board of Directors may exercise the authority of the Board
of Directors to the extent provided in its enabling resolution and any
pertinent subsequent resolutions adopted in

 



C-5  like manner, provided that the authority of each such committee shall be
subject to applicable law. Each committee of the Board of Directors shall keep
regular minutes of its proceedings and shall report to the Board of Directors
when requested to do so.

2.11 _Telephone Meetings_. Members of the Board of Directors or of any
committee appointed by the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of
the Board of Directors or committee by means of a conference telephone or
similar communications equipment that enables all persons participating in the
meeting to hear each other during the meeting. Participation by such means
shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.

2.12 _Compensation of Directors_. The Board of Directors may fix the
compensation of directors as such and may authorize the reimbursement of their
expenses.

---|---|--- 
 

4.2 _Consideration for Shares_. Shares of the Corporation may be issued for

the Board of Directors and shareholders, and all actions taken without a
meeting, and all actions taken by a committee exercising the authority of the
Board of Directors. The Corporation or its agent shall maintain, in 

 



C-8  a form that permits preparation of a list, a list of the names and addresses
of its shareholders, in alphabetical order by class of shares, and the number,

maintain appropriate accounting records, and at its principal place of
business shall keep copies of: (i) its articles of incorporation or restated

from minutes of any meeting of the Board of Directors, records of any action
of a committee of the Board of Directors, records of actions taken by the
Board of Directors without a meeting, minutes of shareholders meetings held
or records of action taken by shareholders without a meeting not within the
past three years, accounting records of the Corporation, or the record of
shareholders; provided that the shareholder shall have made a demand
describing with reasonable particularity the shareholders purpose and the
records the shareholder desires to inspect, and provided further that the
records are directly connected to the shareholders purpose. This Section 5.3
shall not affect any right of shareholders to inspect records of the
Corporation that may be otherwise granted to the shareholders by law.

 

5.4 _Waiver of Section 1501 of California General Law_. To the extent that
the Corporation is subject to compliance with Section 1501 of the California
General Corporation Law, so long as the Corporation has less than 100 holders
of record of its shares, the annual report to shareholders referred to in
Section 1501 of the California Corporations Code is expressly dispensed with,

fiscal year, or in any event prior to its annual meeting of shareholders, the

SECTION 10

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OTHERS_

 

10.1 _Grant of Indemnification_. Subject to Section 10.2, each person who was
or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved
(including, without limitation, as a witness) in any threatened, pending, or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether formal or informal, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director of the Corporation or
who, while a director of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other
enterprise, or employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, costs, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director and shall inure
to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.

 



C-10 10.2 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding Section 10.1, no
indemnification shall be provided hereunder to any such person to the extent
that such indemnification would be prohibited by the Washington business
corporation act or other applicable law as then in effect, nor, except as
provided in Section 10.4 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce
rights to indemnification, shall the Corporation indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person except where such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

10.3 _Advancement of Expenses_. The right to indemnification conferred in
this Section 10 shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
reasonable expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of
its final disposition, except where the Board of Directors shall have adopted
a resolution expressly disapproving such advancement of expenses, if the
director furnishes the Corporation (i) a written affirmation of the directors
good faith belief that the director has met the standard of conduct
as described by the Washington business corporation act, and (ii) a written
undertaking, executed personally or on the directors behalf to repay the
advance if it is ultimately determined that the director did not meet the
standard of conduct as described by the Washington business corporation act,
which undertaking must be an unlimited general obligation of the director but
need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability
to make repayment. The authorization of payments for such advancement of
expenses may be made by resolution adopted by the shareholders or the Board of
Directors.

 

10.4 _Right to Enforce Indemnification_. If a claim under Section 10.1 is not
paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been
received by the Corporation, or if a claim for expenses incurred in defending
a proceeding in advance of its final disposition authorized under Section 10.3
is not paid within 20 days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, to the extent
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting such claim. The claimant shall be presumed to be
entitled to indemnification hereunder upon submission of a written claim (and,
in an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, where the required
undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation), and thereafter the
Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that
the claimant is so entitled. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action with respect to expenses authorized under Section 10.3) that
the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible
hereunder or under the Washington business corporation act for
the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of or reimbursement or
advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
the claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth herein or
in the

 



C-11  Washington business corporation act nor (except as provided in Section 10.3)
an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the claimant is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is
not so entitled.

 

10.5 _Nonexclusivity_. The right to indemnification and the payment of
expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Section 10 shall be valid to the extent
consistent with Washington law.

10.6 _Indemnification of Officers, Employees and Agents_. The Corporation
may, by action of its Board of Directors from time to time, provide
indemnification and pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding to officers, employees and agents of the Corporation on the same
terms and with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Section 10
with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors
of the Corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by,
the Washington business corporation act or on such other terms as the Board
may deem proper.

10.7 _Insurance and Other Security_. The Corporation may maintain insurance,
at its expense, to protect itself and any individual who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, a
partnership, a joint venture, a trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in that capacity or
arising from the individuals status as an officer, director, agent, or
employee, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against the same liability under the Washington business
corporation act. The Corporation may enter into contracts with any director or
officer of the Corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Section 10
and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means
(including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of
such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this
Section 10\.

 

10.8 _Amendment or Modification_. This Section 10 may be altered or amended at
any time as provided in these bylaws, but no such amendment shall have the
effect of diminishing the rights of any person who is or was an officer or
director as to any acts or omissions taken or omitted to be taken prior to the
effective date of such amendment.

 

10.9 _Effect of Section_. The rights conferred by this Section 10 shall be
deemed to be contract rights between the Corporation and each person who is
or was a director or an officer. The Corporation expressly intends each such
person to rely on the rights conferred hereby in performing such persons
respective duties on behalf of the Corporation.

 

SECTION 11

 

 _REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS_

 

Unless otherwise restricted by the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President and the Secretary of the
Corporation are each authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of
the Corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of other
corporations standing in the name of the Corporation. This authority may be
exercised by any such officer either in person or by a duly executed proxy or
power of attorney.

Return that includes as Weyerhaeuser Group member. In connection therewith, in
the event that the RMT Group (or any member thereof) actually utilizes any
Weyerhaeuser Tax Asset to reduce its Tax liability (determined by treating
any Weyerhaeuser Tax Asset that is a deduction as the last item of deduction
claimed on a Tax Return of the RMT Group), Parent shall make a payment to WNR
in an amount equal to the overall net reduction in Tax liability realized as a
result of utilizing the relevant Weyerhaeuser Tax Asset, taking into account
the net effect of all federal, state and local Taxes. Any such payment shall
be made within 30 days after the RMT Group (or any member thereof), as the

increased for any reason, Parent shall pay WNR for the benefit of any such
increase in a manner consistent with this provision. To the extent that,

Weyerhaeuser Tax Attributes arising from such losses will be properly
recognized while WRECO is a member of the WNR consolidated group under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii), and shall report the losses
consistent herewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Weyerhaeuser shall be responsible for any Transfer Taxes

the parties are unable to resolve all disputed issues within the following
10-day period, they shall submit the remaining disputed issues to the Tax
Advisor for resolution at least five days prior to the due date for filing the
applicable income Tax Return (including extensions). The preparing partys
return positions with respect to the disputed issues shall be upheld except
for any such positions that the Tax Advisor concludes do not satisfy the
Applicable Penalty Standard. The non-preparing party shall be liable for all
fees and expenses of the Tax Advisor incurred under this Section 3.01(d);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the preparing party shall be liable for all such
fees and expenses incurred with respect to any Tax Return for which the Tax
Advisor concludes a preparing party return position did not satisfy the
Applicable Penalty Standard. In the case of Tax Returns that are not Income
Tax Returns (including Business and Occupations Tax Returns for the State
of Washington) (" _Non-Income Tax Returns_ ") the preparing party will
deliver drafts of such Non-Income Tax Returns at least two days prior to the
date on which such Non-Income Tax Returns are required to be filed.

 

(e) Parent shall not cause or permit any WRECO Group member to file any
amended Tax Return with respect to a Joint Return or a WRECO Separate Return
for any Pre-Transaction Agreement Period.

(f) Except as required by any Transaction Document, Parent shall not cause or
permit any WRECO Group member to take any action on the Closing Date other
than in the ordinary course of business, including the sale of any assets,
distribution of any dividend or making of any Tax election.

 

SECTION 3.02. _Treatment of Transactions_. The parties shall report the
Transactions for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the Tax
Opinion, unless, and then only to the extent, an alternative position is
required pursuant to a Final Determination. Except in the case of a WRECO
Separate Return, a Transfer Tax Return and a Tax Return of the RMT Group,
Weyerhaeuser shall determine the Tax reporting of any issue relating to the
Transactions that is not covered by the Tax Opinion.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Tax-Free Treatment of Distribution and Related Transaction_

 

SECTION 4.01. _Representations_. (a) Weyerhaeuser represents and warrants to
Parent that, as of the Closing Date, (i) Weyerhaeuser knows of no facts that
could cause any Transaction to fail to qualify for Intended Tax Treatment,
(ii) Weyerhaeuser has no plan or intention to take any action inconsistent
with the Weyerhaeuser Representation Letter or any covenant of Weyerhaeuser
set forth this Agreement and (iii) no pre-Distribution acquisition or

 



E-12  sale of Weyerhaeuser Common Shares by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiary will be part of a plan (or series of related transactions), within
the meaning of Section 355(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.355-7(b), that includes the Distribution.

(b) Parent represents and warrants to Weyerhaeuser that, as of the Closing
Date, (i) Parent knows of no facts that could cause any Transaction to fail to
qualify for Intended Tax Treatment and (ii) Parent has no plan or intention to
take any action inconsistent with the Parent Representation Letter or any
covenant of the RMT Group member set forth in this Agreement. Parent further
represents and warrants that, immediately before the Effective Time, the
amount of shares of Parent Capital Stock treated as outstanding for purposes
of Section 355(e) of the Code will not exceed 33,000,000 shares. Any equity-
based compensation awards in respect of Parent Capital Stock outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall be treated as vested or exercised,
as the case may be, and the resulting Parent Capital Stock shall be treated
as outstanding stock for purposes of the calculation in the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

SECTION 4.02. _Covenants_. (a) During the Restricted Period, (i) Weyerhaeuser
shall not, and shall not permit any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary (or any officers
or directors acting on behalf of Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary,
or any Person acting with the implicit or explicit permission of any such
officers or directors) to, take or fail to take any action if such action (or
the failure to take such action) would (A) be inconsistent with any covenant,
representation or statement made by Weyerhaeuser in the Weyerhaeuser
Representation Letter or in this Agreement or (B) prevent, or be
reasonably likely to prevent, any Transaction from qualifying for Intended
Tax Treatment, and (ii) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any RMT Group
member (or any officers or directors acting on behalf of any RMT Group member,
or any Person acting with the implicit or explicit permission of any such
officers or directors) to, take or fail to take any action if such action (or
the failure to take such action) would (A) be inconsistent with any covenant,
representation or statement made by Parent in the Parent Representation
Letter or in this Agreement or (B) prevent, or be reasonably likely to
prevent, any Transaction from qualifying for Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.02(a), during the Restricted
Period, subject to Section 4.02(d), Parent shall not, and shall not permit
any RMT Group member (or any officers or directors acting on behalf of any RMT
Group member, or any Person acting with the implicit or explicit permission of
any such officers or directors) to:

 

(i) enter into any agreement, understanding, arrangement or substantial
negotiations, as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(h), pursuant
to which any Person would (directly or indirectly) acquire, or have the right
to acquire Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock. For these purposes, an
acquisition of Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock, as applicable,
shall include, without limitation, any recapitalization, repurchase or
redemption of Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock, any issuance of
Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock (including any nonvoting stock) or
an instrument exchangeable or convertible into Parent Capital Stock or WRECO
Capital Stock (whether pursuant to an exercise of stock options, as a result
of a capital contribution to Parent or WRECO, as applicable, or otherwise),
any option grant, any amendment to the certificate or articles of
incorporation (or other

 



E-13  organizational document) of Parent or WRECO, as applicable, or any other
action (whether effected through a shareholder vote or otherwise) affecting
the voting rights of Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock (including
through the conversion of any Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock into
another class of capital stock); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) WRECO shall
be permitted to issue WRECO Capital Stock to Parent; (B) Parent shall be
permitted to issue options, restricted stock, and deferred stock units in
respect of a number of shares of Parent Capital Stock and that does not exceed
the Option Amount pursuant to an employee stock purchase agreement, equity
compensation agreement, retirement plan or other compensation arrangement; (C)
vesting of any restricted stock or deferred stock units that a Safe Harbor
VIII Person is entitled to receive (or would be entitled to receive
upon achieving the relevant hurdles in existence) as of the Effective Time
shall not be treated as an acquisition of Parent Capital Stock for purposes of
this Section 4.02(b)(i); (D) Parent shall be permitted to issue Parent Capital
Stock to a Safe Harbor VIII Person pursuant to the exercise of an option to
acquire Parent Capital Stock that was granted at or prior to the Effective
Time; (E) with respect to any issuances of options, restricted stock or
deferred stock units in respect of shares of Parent Capital Stock in excess
of the Option Amount, after Weyerhaeusers receipt and acceptance of, and
solely to the extent consistent with, an Equity Compensation Opinion delivered
to Weyerhaeuser by Parent, until the earlier of (1) any amendment of the
Covered Compensation Arrangement and (2) a change in applicable Tax Law,
Parent or WRECO, as applicable, may issue options, restricted stock and
deferred stock units in respect of Parent Capital Stock and WRECO Common
Stock pursuant to an employee stock purchase agreement, equity compensation
agreement, retirement plan or other compensation arrangement that is described
in the Equity Compensation Opinion (such arrangement, the "Covered
Compensation Arrangement"), and Parent or WRECO, as applicable, may issue the
shares of Parent Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock underlying such options,
restricted stock and/or deferred stock units upon the exercise or vesting
thereof, and any such shares shall not be treated as an acquisition of Parent
Capital Stock or WRECO Capital Stock, as applicable; (F) subject to compliance
with Section 4.02(d), Parent may redeem, retire, repurchase or otherwise
acquire Parent Capital Stock in a manner that complies with the requirements
of Revenue Procedure 96-30 (as in effect prior to the release of Revenue
Procedure 2003-48); and (G) Parent may adopt a shareholder rights plan (and
issue Parent Capital Stock in accordance therewith) that is described in or
is similar to the shareholder rights plan described in IRS Revenue Ruling
90-11 (for this purpose a shareholder rights plan will be considered similar
to the plan described in IRS Revenue Ruling 90-11 only if the principal
purpose for the adoption of the plan providing for such rights is to establish
a mechanism by which a publicly held corporation can, in the future, provide
shareholders with rights to purchase stock at substantially less than fair
market value as a means of responding to unsolicited offers to acquire the
corporation);

(ii) merge or consolidate Parent or WRECO with any other Person, or liquidate
or partially liquidate Parent or WRECO;

(iii) cause or permit Parent or WRECO to be treated as other than a
corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes; or

 



E-14 (iv) cause or permit WRECO to cease to engage in the Active Trade or Business,
or engage in any transaction that could result in WRECO ceasing to be a
company whose separate affiliated group, as defined in Section 355(b)(3)(B) of
the Code, is so engaged; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Merger, the
WRECO Group shall, with respect to transactions not in the ordinary course of
business, be permitted to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets with
an aggregate value up to 331/3% of its assets (determined based on the gross
fair market value of the WRECO Groups assets immediately before the Closing
Date) in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
prevent the WRECO Group from selling or disposing of assets in the ordinary
course of business and any such sales shall be disregarded for purpose of
applying the limitation set forth in this Section 4.02(b)(iv).

 

(c) To the extent that as a result of a subsequent amendment to the Code or
the Treasury Regulations, any action or a failure to take any action by
Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser Subsidiaries or an RMT Group member could
affect any Transactions qualification for the Intended Tax Treatment, then
the covenants contained in Section 4.02(a)(i)(B) and in Section
4.02(a)(ii)(B) shall automatically be deemed to incorporate by reference such
actions and the failure to take such actions, and the RMT Group shall comply
with the requirements of the relevant amendment through the end of the
Restricted Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such action or failure to
take any such action before the date the relevant amendment is enacted shall
constitute a breach of such Sections to the extent such actions or failure to
take such actions would not have otherwise constituted a breach of such
Sections before such date.

(d) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any RMT Group member to, take any
action prohibited by Sections 4.02(b) and (c), unless (i) Weyerhaeuser
receives prior written notice describing the proposed action in reasonable
detail and (ii) Parent delivers to Weyerhaeuser (A) an Unqualified Opinion
and Weyerhaeuser, in its reasonable discretion, which discretion shall be
exercised in good faith solely to preserve the Intended Tax Treatment,
provides its written consent permitting the proposed action, or (B) a
Ruling. Weyerhaeusers obligation to cooperate in connection with Parents
delivery of an Unqualified Opinion or Ruling is as expressly set forth in
Section 5.05(b) below. The right of Weyerhaeuser and the Weyerhaeuser
Subsidiaries to indemnification for Transaction Taxes shall be determined
without regard to whether the RMT Group satisfies any or all of the
requirements of this Section 4.02(d).

 

ARTICLE V

_Tax Contests; Indemnification; Cooperation_

SECTION 5.01. _Notice of Tax Contests_. If any party (the " _Indemnitee_ ")
receives written notice of the commencement of any Tax Contest for which
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement, and such Indemnitee intends to
seek indemnity pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall promptly
provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written notice of
such Tax Contest, and thereafter shall promptly forward or make available to
the Indemnifying Parties copies of all notices and communications with a
Taxing Authority solely to the extent relating to such Tax Contest. Failure
of the Indemnitee to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Parties from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.

 



E-15 SECTION 5.02. _Control of Tax Contests_. (a) Except as provided in Section
5.02(b), Weyerhaeuser shall have the right to (i) contest, compromise or
settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed or asserted with respect to any
Tax liability of a Weyerhaeuser Group member, any Tax liability reflected on
a Joint Return, or any tax liability reflected on a WRECO Separate Return for
a Pre-Transaction Agreement Period, and (ii) file, prosecute, compromise or
settle any Adjustment Request (and determine the manner in which any Refund
shall be received) with respect to any such Taxes for any such period. If any
Tax Contest described in the preceding sentence relates to WRECO Group Taxes
or Transaction Taxes with respect to which Parent could be liable under
Section 2.02(a) (either an " _RMT Issue_ "), (A) Weyerhaeuser shall (1) keep
Parent fully informed, in all material respects, regarding the progress of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Contest, (2) promptly provide Parent with
copies of any correspondence relating to Taxes received from any Taxing
Authority in connection with such Tax Contest and (3) provide Parent with
drafts of any correspondence relating to Taxes from Weyerhaeuser to any Taxing
Authority in connection with such Tax Contest and provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such correspondence and (B) if Parent
acknowledges its liability in writing for all the Taxes that would be owed to
a Taxing Authority in the event of an adverse determination with respect to
the RMT Issue, Weyerhaeuser shall not settle or compromise such RMT Issue
without Parents written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Parent withholds its consent to a
settlement or compromise described in clause (B) above, Parent shall be liable
for any Taxes resulting from a Final Determination to the extent the basis for
the Final Determination is such that the RMT Group would have liability for
the applicable Taxes under this Agreement or if the Final Determination fails
to clearly articulate the basis for liability such that it is not reasonably
ascertainable which party would be liable for the Taxes under this Agreement.
Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Final Determination clearly provides the basis for such
determination.

 

(b) Parent shall have the right to (i) contest, compromise or settle any
adjustment or deficiency proposed or asserted with respect to any Tax
liability reflected on any WRECO Separate Return for a period ending after the
date of the Transaction Agreement (including any Straddle Period) and any Tax
liability reflected on a Transfer Tax Return, and (ii) file,
prosecute, compromise or settle any Adjustment Request (and determine the
manner in which any Refund shall be received) with respect to any Tax
reflected on such Tax Returns for such period. If any Tax Contest described in
the preceding sentence relates to Weyerhaeuser Group Taxes or Transaction
Taxes with respect to which Weyerhaeuser could be liable under Section 2.02(b)
(either, a " _Weyerhaeuser Issue_ "), (A) Parent shall (1) keep Weyerhaeuser
fully informed, in all material respects, regarding the progress of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Contest, (2) promptly provide Weyerhaeuser
with copies of any correspondence relating to Taxes received from any Taxing
Authority in connection with such Tax Contest and (3) provide Weyerhaeuser
with drafts of any correspondence relating to Taxes from Parent to any Taxing
Authority in connection with such Tax Contest and provide Weyerhaeuser with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such correspondence and (B) if
Weyerhaeuser acknowledges its liability in writing for all the Taxes that
would be owed to a Taxing Authority in the event of an

 



E-16  adverse determination with respect to the Weyerhaeuser Issue, Parent shall
not settle or compromise such Weyerhaeuser Issue without Weyerhaeusers
written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. If Weyerhaeuser withholds its consent to a settlement or
compromise described in clause (B) above, Weyerhaeuser shall be liable for any
Taxes resulting from a Final Determination to the extent the basis for the
Final Determination is such that the Weyerhaeuser Group would have liability
for the applicable Taxes under this Agreement or if the Final Determination
fails to clearly articulate the basis for liability such that it is not
reasonably ascertainable which party would be liable for the Taxes under this
Agreement. Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Final Determination clearly provides the basis for such
determination.

 

SECTION 5.03. _Indemnification Payments_. (a) The Indemnitee shall notify the
Indemnifying Party promptly in writing of its discovery of any matter that
does not involve a Tax Contest giving rise to the claim of indemnity pursuant
to this Agreement. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of
this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 10 days
from receipt of any such notice to give notice of a dispute of the claim to
the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Unless the
Indemnifying Party gives notice of a dispute of the claim within such 10-day
period, the Indemnifying Party shall make the claimed payment to the
Indemnitee within 10 days after receiving notice of (i) the Indemnitees
payment of a Tax for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under this
Agreement or (ii) a Final Determination which results in the Indemnifying
Party becoming obligated to make a payment to the Indemnitee under this
Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall not be required to make any payments under this Agreement to
Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary until the aggregate amount of
such payments due (but for this Section 5.03(b)) exceeds the net amount paid
by WRECO to WNR after the date of the Transaction Agreement in respect of
(without duplication), (i) WRECO Group Taxes or (ii) payables that
arise after the date of the Transaction Agreement pursuant to the Tax
Allocation Agreement, dated January 1, 2010, between WNR and WRECO, and
thereafter Parent shall only be required to make payments to the extent of
such excess. Weyerhaeuser will provide Parent with evidence of the amounts
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, in a form mutually agreed upon by the
parties. For purposes of calculating the net amount paid by WRECO to WNR in
the previous sentence, any increase after the date of the Transaction
Agreement in the amount of Intercompany Debt in respect of Taxes or payables
described in clause (i) or (ii) above shall be taken into account as a payment
from WRECO to WNR.

 

SECTION 5.04. _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. In the absence of a Final
Determination to the contrary, any amount payable with respect to any Tax
under this Agreement shall be treated as occurring immediately prior to the
WRECO Spin, as an intercompany distribution or a contribution to capital, as
the case may be.

 

SECTION 5.05. _Cooperation_. (a) Each of Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to Section 5.05(b) below, cooperate
fully with all

 



E-17  reasonable requests from the other parties in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns and Adjustment Requests, the resolution
of Tax Contests and any other matters covered herein. If any parties fail to
comply with any of their obligations set forth in this Section 5.06(a), and
such failure results in the imposition of additional Taxes, the nonperforming
parties shall be liable for such additional Taxes.

 

(b) In connection with the foregoing, Weyerhaeuser shall, at Parents sole
expense, reasonably cooperate with Parent, upon its written request, in
connection with obtaining (i) a Ruling or (ii) an Unqualified Opinion. Such
cooperation shall include Weyerhaeuser providing any information, submissions,
representations and covenants reasonably requested by a recipient that has
previously executed with Weyerhaeuser an appropriate confidentiality
agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Weyerhaeuser and that permits
reliance by Weyerhaeuser. This Section 5.05 shall not require Weyerhaeuser to
take any action (including the provision of information, submissions,
representations or covenants) that could reasonably be expected to affect
Weyerhaeusers indemnity obligation for Taxes under this Agreement, decrease
in any respect Parents indemnity obligation for Taxes under this Agreement,
or cause Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary to have any liability to
any third party, including any liability for increased Taxes. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that, in the case of a Ruling, Parent shall
immediately notify Weyerhaeuser if the IRS seeks any non-publicly available
information regarding Weyerhaeuser or any of its Affiliates, and Parent shall
not provide any such information to the IRS without Weyerhaeusers written
consent, which consent can be withheld or provided in Weyerhaeusers sole and
absolute discretion. Parent shall promptly withdraw any such Ruling request
(and immediately notify Weyerhaeuser in writing of such withdrawal)
if Weyerhaeuser does not affirmatively consent to provide the requested
information within 48 hours of Parents notification to Weyerhaeuser regarding
the request therefor. Parent shall provide to Weyerhaeuser, for its review and
approval prior to filing, a copy of any Ruling request and any other
submissions made to the IRS in connection therewith, and Parent shall provide
to Weyerhaeuser a copy of any Ruling obtained in connection with such request.

 

SECTION 5.06. _Tax Records_. Each of Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, retain all Tax Records in its possession relating
to or relevant to any Tax matter for which any party may have an indemnity
obligation hereunder until expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax
periods to which such Tax Records relate (giving effect to any
valid extensions made known to the Purchaser) plus six months.

SECTION 5.07. _Confidentiality_. Any information or documents provided under
this Agreement shall be kept confidential by the recipient parties, except as
may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or
the resolution of any Tax Contest. In addition, if Weyerhaeuser, WRECO or
Parent determines that providing such information could be commercially
detrimental, violate any Law or agreement or waive any privilege, the parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to permit compliance with the
obligations under this Agreement in a manner that avoids any such harm or
consequence.

 



E-18 ARTICLE VI

 

 _Dispute Resolution_

 

SECTION 6.01 _Tax Disputes_. The parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any dispute arising in connection with this Agreement within 30
days of the date on which any such dispute arises. Upon written notice by a
party after such 30-day period, the matter will be referred to a U.S. tax
counsel or other tax advisor of recognized national standing (the "
_Tax Advisor_ "). Weyerhaeuser and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
jointly select a Tax Advisor within five days of such written notice. If
Weyerhaeuser and Parent do not agree on the selection of the Tax Advisor
within such five-day period, the Tax Advisor shall be selected by
Weyerhaeusers and Parents respective U.S. tax counsel or other advisors of
recognized national standing within the following 10-day period. The Tax
Advisor may, in its discretion, obtain the services of any third party
necessary to assist it in resolving the dispute. The Tax Advisor shall furnish
written notice to the parties of its resolution of the dispute as soon as
practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days after acceptance of the
matter for resolution. Any such resolution by the Tax Advisor shall be binding
on the parties, and the parties shall take, or cause to be taken, any action
necessary to implement such resolution. All fees and expenses of the Tax
Advisor shall be shared equally by Weyerhaeuser and Parent. If any dispute
regarding the preparation of a Tax Return is not resolved before the due date
for filing such return, the return shall be filed in the manner deemed correct
by the party responsible for filing the return without prejudice to the
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, provided that the preparing
party shall file an amended Tax Return, within 10 days after the completion of
the process set forth in this Section 6.01, reflecting any changes made in
connection with such process.

SECTION 7.02. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement

public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall

substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term

that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

SECTION 7.04. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents, constitutes the

or remedies.

SECTION 7.05. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless

interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without

without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 7.07. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time. Any amendment to this Agreement shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto. The parties hereto may, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the terms or conditions contained
in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights hereunder or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

SECTION 7.08. _Termination_. This Agreement shall automatically
terminate, without further action by any party hereto, upon the termination
of the Transaction Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01 thereof. In the event
of any such termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the

other than Section 5.07 and this Article VII, which provisions shall survive
such termination.

 

SECTION 7.09. _Survival_. All Sections of this Agreement shall be
unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as
