 _Agreement_

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

SECTION I- MERGER

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with Section 264 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _Corporation Law_ "), Adjoined shall be merged (the "
_Merger_ ") with and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Adjoined shall cease and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_
") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Adjoined
in accordance with the Corporation Law.

  



  

1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon
as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall file
a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Corporation Law and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the Corporation Law. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (the time the Merger becomes effective being
referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the Corporation Law.

  



  

1.4 _Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement._

  



  

(a) The Certificate of Formation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving
Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) The operating agreement of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the operating agreement of the Surviving Company
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

  



  

1.5 _Managers_. The managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the managers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

1.6 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

1.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
outstanding capital stock of Adjoined or any interests in Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) Each outstanding interest in Merger Sub shall be converted into and
become an interest in the Surviving Company.

  



  

(b) Each share of Adjoined capital stock that is held in the treasury of
Adjoined (collectively the " _Treasury Shares_ ") shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each share of Adjoined capital stock that is owned by Parent or Merger
Sub, if any, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(d) Subject to _Section 1.7(f) _hereof, each share of Adjoined Series B
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding shall be converted into the right to
receive from Parent, in the manner set forth in _Section 1.8_ and _Section
2.2_ hereof (i) $1.50 in cash, _plus_  (ii) .0671 shares of Parents common
stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), _plus_ (iii)
the consideration specified in _Section 1.7(e) _hereof. Subsequent to the
Closing, Parent and the Owners Representative shall cooperate in good faith
to implement rounding procedures for this _Section 1.7(d) _to ensure that,
pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_, (i) each holder of Adjoined Series
B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time receives an amount
of cash and Parent Common Stock (valued at the Specified Price) equal to at
least $2.59 multiplied by the total number of shares of Adjoined Series
B Preferred Stock owned by such holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) all holders of Adjoined Series B Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time receive, in the aggregate, a total
amount of cash and Parent Common Stock (valued at the Specified Price) of not
less than $25,016,191.00 (but in no event more than $25,016,195.00).

  



  

(e) Subject to _Section 1.7(f) _hereof, each share of Adjoined capital
stock issued and outstanding, including each share of Common Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock (other than shares of capital
stock to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.7(b) _and  _Section
1.7(c) _hereof) shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent, in
the manner set forth in _Section 1.8_ and _Section 2.2_ hereof, cash and
Parent Company Stock with an aggregate value (based on the Specified Price)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the remainder of (i) the
"Merger Price" specified in _Section 1.8_ below, _minus_ (ii)
$25,016,191.00, by (y) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Adjoined
capital stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.  As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Adjoined capital stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Adjoined capital stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger consideration specified in this
_Section 1.7_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued
and outstanding shares of Adjoined capital stock held by a Person (a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing or otherwise contractually waived his

  



        
   

  



  

right of appraisal and who shall have properly demanded appraisal in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the Corporation Law
concerning the right of holders of Adjoined capital stock to dissent from the
Merger and require appraisal of their shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted as described in _Section 1.7(d) _and/or _Section 1.7(e)
_but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to Section 262
of the Corporation Law. If, after the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shareholder withdraws demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise
loses his right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the Corporation Law,
his Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.7(d) _and/or _Section 1.7(e)_. Adjoined shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares received by Adjoined,
and (ii) the opportunity to participate with Adjoined (or, subsequent to the
Effective Time, the Owners Representative) in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. Adjoined (or, subsequent to
the Effective Time, the Owners Representative) will not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and will not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), settle or offer to settle any such demands. Subject to _Section
1.12_, the Sellers shall be severally responsible (in accordance with each
Sellers Proportionate Share) for the excess, if any, of (x) all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
arising out of, or incurred in connection with, Adjoineds (or, subsequent to
the Effective Time, the Owners Representatives) negotiations or proceedings
relating to any demand for appraisal of the Dissenting Shares, including,
without limitation, any payment required to be made to any Dissenting
Shareholder with respect to the settlement or resolution of any appraisal
proceeding relating thereto _over_ (y) the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration that would have otherwise been payable with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 1.7(d) _and/or  _Section 1.7(e)
_hereof (such excess being referred to as the " _Excess Appraisal Costs_ ").

  



  

1.8 _Aggregate Merger Price_. As payment in full for the shares of Adjoined
capital stock being acquired by Parent pursuant to the Merger, Parent shall
pay, in the manner set forth in _Section 2.2_, the sum of (i) One Hundred
Sixty-Five Million Dollars ($165,000,000.00) (the " _Base Merger Price_ "),
_minus_ (ii) the amount of the Companys Funded Indebtedness as of the
Closing, if any, _plus_ (iii) the amount of the Companys Available Cash as
of the Closing, _minus_ (iv) the excess, if any, of $9,000,000 (the " _Target
Working Capital Amount_ ") over the Companys Working Capital as of the
Closing, _plus_ (v) the excess, if any, of the Companys Working Capital as
of Closing over the Target Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (vi) $7,600,000.00
(which the parties acknowledge satisfies the Companys deemed purchase price
"earn-out" obligations under the Gazelle Agreement) (such sum is herein
referred to as the " _Merger Price_ "), subject to further adjustment as
provided in _Section 7.3_ hereof. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, Parent shall pay the Merger Price by delivering to (i) the Escrow
Agent $10,150,000 in cash and 452,558 shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii)
the Exchange Agent a cash amount equal to 58% of the Merger Price (it being
agreed that the Estimated Merger Price shall be used until the Merger Price
shall become final pursuant to _Section 1.11_ hereof), _minus_
the $10,150,000 in cash to be delivered to the Escrow Agent, and a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the remainder of (1) the quotient of
(x) 42% of the Merger Price (it being agreed that the Estimated Merger Price
shall be used until the Merger Price shall become final pursuant to _Section
1.11_ hereof), _divided by_ (y) $16.241 (the " _Specified Price_ "), _minus_
 (2) the 452,558 shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Escrow
Agent. Any calculation of a portion of a share of Parent Common Stock shall
be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, and any cash payment
shall be rounded to the nearest cent. At Closing, after payments have been
made to Dissenting Shareholders, if any, not less than 42% of the aggregate
Merger Price shall be in the form of Parent Common Stock (based on the
Specified Price).

  



  

1.9 _Estimated Merger Price_. Not later than two business days prior to the
scheduled Closing Date, Parent and Adjoined shall jointly and in good faith
estimate the Merger Price (the " _Estimated Merger Price_ "). Parent and
Adjoined shall acknowledge the Estimated Merger Price in a writing that
specifies the estimated Working Capital, Available Cash and Funded
Indebtedness (if any) reflected therein. Adjoined shall provide to Parent
and its representatives any working papers, trial balances and similar
materials available to or prepared by Adjoined or its representatives in
connection with Adjoineds estimate of the Merger Price hereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

1.10 _Post-Closing Review of Merger Price_. As soon as practical (and in no
event later than 60 days after the Closing Date), Parent shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Owners Representative (i) if and only if
Parent obtains such audited balance sheet within 60 days after the Closing
Date, an audited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing, accompanied
by a report of a recognized firm of certified public accountants to the
effect that the balance sheet reflects fairly in all material respects
the financial condition of the Company immediately after Closing, and (ii)
a calculation of the Merger Price, including such schedules and data as may
be appropriate to support such calculation and specifically setting forth
Parents calculation of the Companys Available Cash, Working Capital and
Funded Indebtedness as of the Closing, all in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Owners Representative and the Owners Accountants shall
be entitled to review Parents calculation of the Merger Price, and any
working papers, trial balances and similar materials relating thereto
prepared by Parent or its accountants.

  



  

1.11 _Disputes_. The following clauses (i) and (ii) set forth the procedures
for resolving disputes among the parties with respect to the determination of
the Merger Price:

  



  

(i) Within 60 days after delivery to the Owners Representative of Parents
calculation of the Merger Price pursuant to _Section 1.10_, the
Owners Representative may deliver to Parent a written report (the " _Owners
 Report_") prepared, at the option of the Owners Representative, by
themselves or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Owners  Accountants_")
advising Parent either that such preparers (A) agree with Parents
calculation of the Merger Price, or (B) deem that one or more adjustments are
required. If Parent shall concur with the adjustments proposed in the Owners
Report, or if Parent shall not object thereto in a writing delivered to the
Owners Representative within 30 days after Parents receipt of the Owners
Report, the calculation of the Merger Price set forth in such Owners Report
shall become final and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
adjustment absent fraud.  If the Owners Representative do not submit an
Owners Report within the 60-day period provided herein, then the Merger
Price as calculated by Parent shall become final and shall not be subject to
further review, challenge or adjustment absent fraud.

  



  

(ii) In the event that the Owners Representative submit an Owners Report
and Parent and the Owners Representative are unable to resolve the
disagreements set forth in such report within 30 days after the date of the
Owners Report, then such disagreements shall be referred to the Miami,
Florida office of BDO Seidman, LLP or another recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants selected by mutual agreement of the Owners
Representative and Parent (the " _Settlement Accountants_ "), and the
determinations of the Settlement Accountants with respect to the Merger Price
shall be final and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
adjustment absent fraud. The Settlement Accountants shall use their best
efforts to reach a determination not more than 60 days after such referral.

  



  

(iii) Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this _Section 1.11_. Parent and the Sellers (severally in accordance
with each Sellers Proportionate Share) shall each pay one half of the costs
and expenses of the services of the Settlement Accountants.

  



  

1.12 _Post-Closing Merger Price and Excess Appraisal Costs Payments_. Subject
to this _Section 1.12_, the Sellers shall be severally responsible (in
accordance with each Sellers Proportionate Share) for the excess, if any, of
(x) the Estimated Merger Price,  _over_ (y) the Merger Price (such excess
being referred to as the " _Merger Price Shortfall_ "). If the Merger Price
is greater than the Estimated Merger Price, then Parent shall pay to
the Owners Representative (for redistribution to Adjoineds pre-
Closing stockholders) an amount equal to the amount of such excess (it being
agreed such excess shall be paid 58% in cash and 42% in Parent Common Stock
valued at the Specified Price). Parent agrees that it shall seek the first
$1,000,000 of Merger Price Shortfall and Excess Appraisal Costs (in the
aggregate) solely from the Escrow Fund. If the aggregate Merger Price
Shortfall and Excess Appraisal Costs exceed $1,000,000, then Parent may (but
shall not be obligated to) (i) claim such excess under the Escrow Agreement,
or (ii) require each Seller to severally pay (in accordance with such
Sellers Proportionate Share) such excess. If the aggregate Merger Price
Shortfall and Excess Appraisal Costs are less than $1,000,000, then the
Owners Representative and Parent shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay to the Sellers (in accordance with each Sellers Proportionate Share) the
excess of (x)

  



        
   

  



  

$1,000,000, over (y) the aggregate Merger Price Shortfall and Excess
Appraisal Costs. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.12_ shall be
made (i) 42% by the cancellation or delivery of Parent Common Stock (valued
at the Specified Price), as applicable, and (ii) 58% by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
receiving party not later than five (5) business days after the date upon
which the Merger Price shall become final and binding upon the parties.

  



  

SECTION II- CLOSING

  



  

2.1 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") shall be held at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the fifth (5th)
business day after all the conditions stated in _Section VI_ of this
Agreement shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions), at the Chicago offices of Winston and Strawn
LLP, 35 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601. The date upon which the
Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." The
Closing shall be deemed completed as of 11:59 p.m. local time on the evening
of the Closing Date.

  



  

2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, at and upon the
Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall deposit with American Stock and
Trust Company or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Owners Representative (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") certificates representing
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and the
amount of cash payable in the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) an
aggregate of $10,150,000 in cash and 452,558 shares of Parent Common Stock
(together with any investment proceeds thereon, collectively the " _Escrow
Fund_ ") otherwise payable to Adjoineds stockholders pursuant to _Section
1.7(e) _hereof shall instead be delivered to American Stock and Trust Company,
as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), (ii) Adjoined shall, by written
notice with reasonable supporting documentation, direct Parent to deliver a
portion of the cash component of the Merger Price to satisfy all unpaid
Transaction Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company (it being agreed
that any such directed payments shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the
Merger Price otherwise payable to Adjoineds stockholders pursuant to
_Section 1.7(e) _hereof, and that the liabilities retired with such directed
payments shall not be reflected in the calculation of the Companys Working
Capital at Closing), and (iii) Parent shall deduct from the cash component of
the Merger Price otherwise payable to any Adjoined stockholder the amount of
any then outstanding note receivable due Adjoined from such stockholder.
The Escrow Fund and any directed payments pursuant to clause (ii) of
the preceding sentence shall reduce each Sellers Proportionate Share of the
Merger Price otherwise payable to Adjoineds stockholders pursuant to
_Section 1.7(e) _hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Merger Consideration,
exclusive of the Escrow Fund, is referred to herein as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

  



  

(b) Each holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Adjoined
capital stock (other than Dissenting Shares or Treasury Shares) who
surrenders or has surrendered such certificate (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificate),
together with duly executed transmittal materials, to the Exchange Agent
shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to the cash consideration and a
certificate representing Parent Common Stock into which the shares of
Adjoined capital stock shall have been converted pursuant hereto, as well as
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
certificate representing shares of Adjoined capital stock upon compliance
with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each
certificate representing shares of Adjoined capital stock shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time of the Merger to evidence only the
right to receive cash and Parent Common Stock upon such surrender. Parent
shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former
holder of Adjoined capital stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until
such holder surrenders his certificate or certificates representing shares of
Adjoined capital stock for exchange as provided in this _Section 2.2_. If
any certificate for shares of Adjoined capital stock, or any check

  



        
   

  



  

representing cash and/or declared but unpaid dividends, is to be issued in a
name other than that in which a certificate surrendered for exchange is
issued, the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such exchange
shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the certificate
surrendered or provide funds for their purchase or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Adjoined capital stock for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(d) Former stockholders of Adjoined shall not be entitled to vote after the
Effective Time of the Merger at any meeting of Parent stockholders until such
holders have exchanged their certificates representing Adjoined capital stock
for certificates representing Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 2.2_, each certificate theretofore
representing shares of Adjoined capital stock (other than Dissenting Shares
and Treasury Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time of the Merger
represent for all purposes only the right to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash as set forth in this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time of the Merger with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time of
the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate of
Adjoined capital stock with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, until the holder of such certificate of Adjoined capital
stock shall surrender such certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such certificates of Adjoined capital stock
for which shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued, there shall be paid
to the holder of the certificates without interest, (i) the amount of any
cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
of the Merger theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
of the Merger but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Adjoined for six months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any stockholders of Adjoined who have not theretofore
complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of cash, shares of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of
Adjoined capital stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon; _provided_ that,
subject to applicable state escheat law or unclaimed property law, any holder
of a certificate formerly representing shares of Adjoined capital stock who
later surrenders such certificate (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding a loss or destruction of such certificate) to
Parent shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to receive a certificate
representing Parent Common Stock and cash into which the shares of Common
Stock shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement as well as cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled.

  



  

(f) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Adjoined capital stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Adjoined capital
stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
or the Exchange Agent.

  



  

2.3 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Parent or Adjoined changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock or Adjoined capital stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or

  



        
   

  



  

similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent Common Stock or
Adjoined capital stock, as the case may be, and the record date therefor
shall be prior to the Effective Time, the amount of cash Merger Consideration
and Parent Common Stock Merger Consideration per share of Adjoined capital
stock shall be proportionately adjusted. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, Parent shall merge, be acquired or consolidate with, by or
into any other corporation (a " _Business Combination_ ") and the terms
thereof shall provide that Parent Common Stock shall be converted into or
exchanged for the shares of any other corporation or entity, then provision
shall be made as part of the terms of such Business Combination so that
stockholders of Adjoined who would be entitled to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
of each share of Parent Common Stock issuable to such stockholders as
provided herein, the same kind and amount of securities or assets as shall be
distributable upon such Business Combination with respect to one share of
Parent Common Stock (provided that nothing herein shall be construed so as to
release the acquiring entity in any such Business Combination from its
obligations under this Agreement as the successor to Parent).

  



  

2.4 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger; instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of Adjoined capital stock
who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all certificates of the same class of Adjoined
capital stock delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Specified Price.

  



  

2.5 _Payment of Funded Indebtedness_. Adjoined represents and warrants to
Parent that all Contracts evidencing Funded Indebtedness of the Company are
set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ hereto. Adjoined will use all
reasonable commercial efforts to provide to Parent, at least three business
days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, customary pay-off letters from all
holders of Funded Indebtedness (which letters shall contain payoff amounts,
per diems, wire transfer instructions and an agreement to deliver, upon full
payment, UCC-3 termination statements, other appropriate releases and any
original stock certificates, promissory notes or other evidences of
indebtedness marked canceled), and make arrangements, reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and its lenders, for such holders to provide to Adjoined recordable
form lien releases, canceled notes, trademark and patent assignments and
other documents reasonably requested by Parent upon the repayment of all such
Funded Indebtedness.

  



  

2.6 _Closing Deliveries_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Adjoined shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Parent:

  



  

(i) the written resignations, effective as of the Effective Time, of such

the " _Records_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Owners Representative
may retain (and, subsequent to the Closing, the Surviving Company shall
provide the Owners Representative with reasonable access to and the right to
copy) (1) copies of any Tax Returns and Records relating thereto; (2) copies
of any Records that any of Adjoineds stockholders are reasonably likely to
need for complying with Legal Requirements; and (3) copies of any Records
that in the reasonable opinion of the Owners Representative will be required
in connection with the performance of the covenants set forth in this
Agreement;

  



  

(iv) the Certificate of Merger, duly executed by Adjoined;

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Owners Representative:

required of Parent and/or Merger Sub in order to consummate the Merger.

  



  

2.7 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

  



  

(i) by the mutual written consent of Parent and Adjoined; or

  



  

(ii) by Parent by giving written notice to Adjoined at any time (A) in the
event Adjoined has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, such breach results or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, Parent has
notified Adjoined of the breach, and the breach has continued uncured for a
period of 15 days after the notice thereof, or (B) if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before April 30, 2006 by reason of the failure to satisfy
any condition precedent under _Section 6.2_ hereof (unless the failure
results primarily from Parent breaching any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement); or

Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 30, 2006 by reason of the
failure to satisfy any condition precedent under _Section 6.1_ hereof
(unless the failure results primarily from Adjoined breaching any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement).

  



  

2.8 _Effect of Termination_. The provisions of _Section VIII_ and _Sections
9.2 through 9.6_ shall survive any termination pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

SECTION III- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ADJOINED AND OWNERS

  



  

A. _Adjoined Representations_. Adjoined hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that, as of the date hereof:

  



        
   

  



  

3.1 _Corporate Existence and Qualification_.  Adjoined is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Adjoined has the corporate power to own, manage, lease and hold
its properties and to carry on its business as and where such Properties are
presently located and such business is presently conducted. Neither the
character of the Companys Properties nor the nature of the Companys
business requires Adjoined to be duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction outside those identified in _Schedule 3.1_
attached hereto, except where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, and
Adjoined is qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing in each
jurisdiction listed in _Schedule 3.1_.

  



  

3.2 _Authority, Approval and Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Adjoined, and Adjoined has all requisite corporate
power and capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and all Collateral
Agreements executed and delivered or to be executed and delivered in
connection with the transactions provided for hereby, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Collateral Agreements, and to
perform its obligations hereunder and under the Collateral Agreements. This
Agreement and each Collateral Agreement to which Adjoined is a party
constitutes, or upon execution and delivery will constitute, the legal, valid
and binding obligation of Adjoined, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by general equitable principles or
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or similar laws and
judicial decisions from time to time in effect which affect creditors rights
generally. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation by Adjoined of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Adjoined (including approval of Adjoineds
board of directors and stockholders) and, except for the notice required by
Section 228 of the Corporation Law, no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Adjoined are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

3.3 _Capitalization and Corporate Records._

  



  

(a) Adjoineds authorized capital stock consists of (i) 16,934,285 shares of
preferred stock, $.00001 par value, of which 7,275,523 have been designated
as "Series A Preferred Stock" and 9,658,762 have been designated as "Series B
Preferred Stock," and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock. As of the date
hereof, Adjoined has issued and outstanding 19,346,893 shares of Common
Stock, 7,275,523 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and 9,658,761 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock. All issued and outstanding shares of
Adjoineds capital stock are owned of record as set forth on _Schedule
3.3(a) _hereto. All of the outstanding shares of Adjoineds capital stock are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and were not
issued in violation of (i) any preemptive or other rights of any Person to
acquire securities of Adjoined, or (ii) any applicable federal or state
securities laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the " _Securities Laws_ "). Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.3(a)_, no shares of Adjoined capital stock are held in Adjoineds treasury.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(b)_, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, convertible securities, warrants, calls or similar
agreements relating to any shares of capital stock of Adjoined. _Schedule
3.3(b) _sets forth a true and complete listing of all outstanding Adjoined
stock options, including (i) the name of the holder thereof, (ii) the number
and class and/or series of Adjoined capital stock subject thereto, (iii)
the per share exercise price, (iv) the date of grant, and (v) any applicable
vesting schedule.

  



  

(c) Except for the subsidiaries of Adjoined set forth on _Schedule 3.3(c)
_(the " _Subsidiaries_ "), Adjoined does not own, directly or indirectly,
any outstanding securities of or other equity-related interests in any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other Person. _Schedule 3.3(c)
_hereto sets forth the name of each Subsidiary, the number of shares of each
Subsidiarys authorized capital stock, the number and class of shares thereof
duly issued and outstanding, the names of all shareholders or equity holders,
the number of shares of stock owned by each shareholder or the amount of
equity owned by each equity holder and, with respect to each Subsidiary, the
jurisdiction in which it was incorporated or organized. The outstanding
shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and all such shares represented as being owned by Adjoined or

  



        
   

  



  

another Subsidiary are owned by it free and clear of any and all liens,
mortgages, pledges, adverse claims, encumbrances or other restrictions or
limitations whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3(c)
_hereto. There is no existing option, warrant, call, commitment or agreement
to which any Subsidiary is a party requiring, and there are no convertible
securities of any Subsidiary outstanding which upon conversion would require,
the issuance of any additional shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary or
other securities convertible into shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary
or other equity security of any Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of
incorporation or organization. Each Subsidiary has the corporate or limited
liability company, as applicable, power to own, manage, lease and hold its
properties and to carry on its business as and where such properties are
presently located and such business is presently conducted. Neither the
character of any Subsidiarys properties nor the nature of any Subsidiarys
business requires any Subsidiary to be duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation, or other entity, in any jurisdiction outside those
identified in _Schedule 3.3(c) _attached hereto, except where the failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, and each Subsidiary is qualified as a foreign corporation, or
other entity, and in good standing in each jurisdiction listed in _Schedule
3.3(c)_.

  



  

(d) The copies of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or organizational
documents, as the case may be, of Adjoined and the Subsidiaries provided to

and the Subsidiaries made available to Parent for review were correct and
complete in all material respects as required by law as of the date of such
review, no further entries have been made through the date of this Agreement,
and such stock and minute books contain an accurate record of all material
corporate actions of the stockholders and directors (and any committees
thereof) of Adjoined and the Subsidiaries taken by written consent or at a
meeting since Adjoineds inception or, if applicable, the date of Adjoineds
acquisition of the Subsidiary.  All material corporate actions taken by the
Company have been duly authorized or ratified as required by law.

  



  

3.4 _No Company Defaults or Consents_. Except as otherwise set forth in
_Schedule 3.4_ attached hereto, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the carrying out of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
will:

  



  

(i) violate or conflict with any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
the charter or bylaws of Adjoined or any Subsidiary;

in any material respect;

binding upon or applicable to Adjoined or any Subsidiary;

consent, action, approval or authorization of, or registration, declaration,
notice or filing with, any private non-governmental third party or any

Collateral Agreements executed and delivered or to be executed and delivered
by it in connection with the transactions provided for hereby, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Collateral Agreements, and to
perform its obligations hereunder and under the Collateral Agreements. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements and
the performance of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby has been
duly and validly authorized and approved by all corporate or limited
liability company action necessary on the part of each of Parent and Merger
Sub (including approval of the board of directors or managers, as the case
may be, of Parent and Merger Sub) and no other corporate proceedings
or limited liability company proceedings, as the case may be, on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby. There is no
applicable Legal Requirement or requirement of any other Person (including
the Nasdaq National Market) which requires the approval or adoption by
Parents stockholders of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has received the opinion of UBS
Securities LLC, financial advisor to Parent, to the effect that, as of the
date hereof, the Merger Price is fair to Parent from a financial point of
view. This Agreement and each Collateral Agreement to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party constitutes, or upon execution and delivery will constitute,
the legal, valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
general equitable principles or by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, or similar laws and judicial decisions from time to time in
effect which affect creditors rights generally.

  



  

4.3 _No Default or Consents_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the carrying out of the transactions contemplated hereby will:

  



  

(i) violate or conflict with any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
Parent or Merger Sub;

  



  

(ii) violate any Legal Requirements applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in any
material respect;

performance required by, or give any other party the right to terminate, any
material Contract or Permit binding upon or applicable to Parent or Merger
Sub;

  



  

(iv) require Parent or Merger Sub to obtain or make any waiver, consent,

copy of the commitment letter, dated February 10, 2006, of LaSalle Bank

to satisfy all of Parents obligations under this Agreement. Since the date
of the execution of the Commitment Letter, there has not been any change
or modification to the Commitment Letter. Parent has no knowledge that all of
the conditions to lenders funding requirements under the Commitment Letter
will not be satisfied. Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent will not (i) be insolvent (either

of evaluating the merits and risks of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Merger Sub and Parent have conducted an independent investigation
of the Company and its business operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects in making their determination

documents, including any financial statements or schedules included therein,
are referred to as the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). Parent SEC Documents, at

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (b) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be,

published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto when filed,

and security documents, other definitive financing documents or other
reasonably requested certificates or documents, and (iv) using reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain, at Parents sole expense, comfort letters of
accountants and legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.8_  shall require
Adjoined or any Subsidiary to (i) incur any financial obligation prior to the
Closing, or (ii) engage in any activities that could reasonably be expected
to interfere in any material respect with the operation of the Business.

  



  

(b) Parent shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to cause to be
satisfied those conditions to the consummation of the financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter which are within the reasonable control of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates. Parent shall also promptly (i) provide
the Owners Representative with copies of any written changes or termination
of the Commitment Letter and any written commitments for alternative
financing, and (ii) advise the Owners Representative of any material change
in the terms, timing or likelihood of consummating the financings
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Upon Adjoineds reasonable request,
Parent shall also from time to time orally advise Adjoined as to the status
of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

Adjoined shall cause the officers, directors, employees and other agents of
Adjoined and the Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, take any action
to solicit, initiate or encourage any offer or proposal or indication of
interest in a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
any equity interest in, or any portion of the assets of Adjoined and the
Subsidiaries, other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or sales of assets in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. Adjoined shall promptly advise Parent
of the nature of any written offer, proposal or indication of interest that
is submitted to the Company and the identity of the Person making such
written offer, proposal or indication of interest.

  



  

5.10 _Stockholder Approval._

  



  

(a) Adjoined agrees to promptly provide to all stockholders of the Company

the Corporation Law (the " _Notice of Merger_ ").

  



  

(b) Parent and Adjoined shall jointly prepare and provide the Owners and the
Non-Consenting Stockholders all information and documents required by the
Corporation Law, as well as all information and documents necessary or
reasonably requested by Parent, including copies of Parent SEC Documents (the
" _Disclosure Statement_ "), to ensure that neither Parents issuance of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger nor the approval of the Merger by
Adjoineds stockholders requires registration under applicable Federal or
state securities laws. In addition, each of Parent and Adjoined warrants and
agrees that none of the information provided by it specifically for inclusion
in the Disclosure Statement will at the time the Disclosure Statement is
first mailed or otherwise provided to Adjoineds stockholders contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

  



  

(c) The Owners, severally and not jointly, hereby agree that, from and after
the date hereof and until this Agreement shall have been terminated, at any
meeting of the holders of the Adjoined capital stock, however called, or in
connection with any written consent of the holders of Adjoined capital stock,
such Owner shall vote (or cause to be voted) such Owners shares of Adjoined
capital stock (" _Shares_ ") in favor of adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger and the approval of the terms thereof and each of
the other actions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Owners also
severally agrees during such period:

  



  

(i) not to enter into any agreement or understanding with any Person to vote
in any manner inconsistent herewith;

  



  

(ii) not to (i) sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose
of, enforce or permit the execution of the provisions of any redemption
agreement with Adjoined or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for
sale, sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition
of, any of its Shares, or any Shares acquired after the date hereof, or any
interest in any of the foregoing, except to Parent, (ii) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney, deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter into a
voting agreement with respect to any Shares, or any interest in any of the
foregoing, except to Parent or Merger Sub or as otherwise provided herein; or
(iii) take any action that would have the effect of preventing,
disabling, restricting, limiting or interfering with the Owners performance
of such Owners obligations under this Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) that the obligations hereunder shall attach to such stockholders
Shares and shall be binding upon any Person to which legal or beneficial
ownership of such Shares shall pass, whether by operation of law or
otherwise, including, without limitation, such Owners heirs, guardians,
administrators or successors.

  



        
   

  



  

5.11 _Tax Treatment._

  



  

(a) Neither Parent nor Adjoined shall, nor shall they permit their
subsidiaries to, knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any
action which action or failure to act (i) would prevent, or could be
reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) prevent Adjoined or
Parent from receiving the opinions contemplated by _Section 6.1(c)_ and
_Section 6.2(c)_ hereof.

  



  

(b) Parent shall provide to Winston and Strawn LLP (or such other counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent) and Greenberg Traurig, LLP (or such other

hereof. Adjoined shall provide to Winston and Strawn LLP (or such other counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent) and Greenberg Traurig, LLP (or such other
counsel reasonably acceptable to Adjoined) a certificate containing
representations reasonably requested by counsel in connection with the
opinions to be delivered pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_  and _Section 6.2(c)_
hereof.

  



  

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and Adjoined shall each confirm to Winston and Strawn
LLP and to Greenberg Traurig, LLP, on such dates as shall be reasonably
requested by such firms, the accuracy and completeness of the tax
representation letters delivered pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)_. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and Adjoined shall use its best efforts prior to
the Effective Time to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code. Following delivery of the tax representation
letters pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)_ , each of Parent and Adjoined shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Winston and Strawn LLP and
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, respectively, to deliver to it the tax opinions
contemplated by _Section 6.2(c)_  and _Section 6.1(c)_ , respectively.

  



  

5.12 _Stock Options_. As promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, Adjoined shall take all necessary action to cancel as of the
Effective Time each unexercised and then outstanding option for Adjoined
capital stock granted under any Benefit Program or Agreement or otherwise,
and shall deliver to Parent copies of documentation evidencing such action.

  



  

5.13 _Interim Financial Statements_. Prior to the Closing, Adjoined shall
deliver to Parent, no later than 15 business days after the end of each
calendar month, unaudited financial statements of the Company as of the end

7.3 _Post-Closing Indemnity_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the other
provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, _Section 9.1_
 hereof), from and after the Closing, the stockholders of Adjoined
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Sellers_ ") shall severally
(in accordance with each Sellers Proportionate Share) indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and its subsidiaries from and against any and all
Damages arising out of or resulting from (i) a breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any of the representations or warranties made by Adjoined in this Agreement
(disregarding for purposes of this indemnification any "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers referenced in such representations and
warranties), (ii) a breach or default in performance by Adjoined of any
covenant or agreement of Adjoined contained in this Agreement (other than
covenants or agreements of Adjoined or the Surviving Company to be performed
subsequent to Closing), and/or (iii) except to the extent paid on or prior to
the Closing Date or to the extent that any accrual, reserve or other
liability therefor is reflected in the Companys Working Capital as of
Closing, any Income Taxes of the Company allocable to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Any payment made to
Parent by the Sellers pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this
_Section 7.3_  shall constitute a reduction in the Merger Price hereunder.
Parent and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to rely upon the
representations and warranties made by the Owners and Adjoined in this
Agreement regardless of any information provided by Adjoined to Parent
pursuant to _Section 5.4_ hereof or any investigation or audit conducted
before the Closing or the decision of Parent to complete the Closing.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the other
provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, _Section 9.1_
 hereof), from and after the Closing, each Owner shall indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its subsidiaries from and against any and all
Damages arising out of or resulting from (i) a breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any of the representations or warranties made by such Owner in this
Agreement, and/or (ii) a breach or default in performance by such Owner of
any covenant or agreement of such Owner contained in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including, but not
limited to, _Section 9.1_  hereof), from and after the Closing, Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers from and against any and all Damages
arising out of or resulting from (i) a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of
the representations or warranties made by Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement (disregarding for purposes of this indemnification any
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers referenced in such
representations and warranties), and/or (ii) a breach or default in
performance by Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or agreement of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement. The Sellers shall be entitled to rely
upon the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this
Agreement regardless of any information provided by Parent to Adjoined
pursuant to _Section 5.4_ hereof or any investigation or audit conducted
before the Closing or the decision of the Owners Representative to complete
the Closing.

  



  

7.4 _Non-Disclosure._

  



  

(a) _General_. In consideration of the payment of the Merger Price, and in
order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby,

  



        
   

  



  

each Owner hereby severally covenants and agrees that such Owner shall not at
any time divulge, communicate, or use to the detriment of Parent or the
Surviving Company (i) any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, or (ii)
any material non-public information of any kind concerning Parent or its
business that may be in the possession of such Owner, in each case except as
required by law or in connection with the defense of a claim against such
Owner.

  



  

(b) _Injunction_. It is recognized and hereby acknowledged by the parties
hereto that a breach or violation by an Owner of _Section 7.4(a)_ may cause
irreparable harm and damage to Parent in a monetary amount which may be
virtually impossible to ascertain. As a result, each Owner recognizes and
hereby acknowledges that Parent shall be entitled (without the requirement of
posting a bond) to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction
enjoining and restraining any breach or violation of _Section 7.4(a)_ by
such Owner and/or his Affiliates, either directly or indirectly, and
that such right to injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever
other rights or remedies Parent may possess hereunder, at law or in equity.
Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall be construed to prevent
Parent from seeking and recovering from any Owner Damages sustained by it as
a result of any breach or violation by such Owner and/or his Affiliates,
either directly or indirectly, of _Section 7.4(a)_.

  



  

7.5 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company and each Subsidiary to include in their
respective governing documents provisions relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of former officers and directors consistent in all material
respects with those currently set forth in Adjoineds and such Subsidiarys
charter or bylaws for the benefit of the officers and directors of Adjoined
and such Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall jointly
and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the directors and
officers of Adjoined and each Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Management_ ") against all Damages arising out of or in
connection with their service as officers and directors of Adjoined or a
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law or the charter or bylaws of Adjoined and such
Subsidiary in effect as of the date of this Agreement (to the extent
consistent with applicable law), and Parent and the Surviving Company shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, promptly reimburse the
Indemnified Management for all expenses incurred in connection therewith
(subject to an undertaking from the applicable member of Indemnified
Management to repay to Parent such reimbursed expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such member is not entitled to indemnification).

  



  

(c) This _Section 7.5_  shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Indemnified Management and their respective heirs and
personal representatives, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of Parent and the Surviving Company.

  



  

7.6 _Key Employee Non-Compete_. In consideration of the payment of the
Merger Price, and in order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Key Employees
hereby severally covenants and agrees that:

  



  

(a) Without the prior written consent of Parent, such Key Employee shall not
for a period of three (3) years from and after the Effective Time (the "
_Non-Compete Period_ ") (A) directly or indirectly acquire or own in any
manner any interest in any Person (other than Parent) which engages in or
competes with the Combined Business anywhere in the world (the " _Territory_
") (and, in the case of each of Andrew Duncan and David Northington, such
Persons activity of engaging in or competing with the Combined Business
within the Territory accounts for greater than 25% of the revenue or profit
of such Person, so long as neither Mr. Duncan nor Mr. Northington has any
participation whatsoever in any capacity (including, without limitation, as
an owner, manager, employee, advisor, consultant, officer, director, operator
or otherwise) in such Persons activity of engaging in or competing with the
Combined Business within the Territory), (B) be employed by or serve as an
employee, agent, officer, director of, or as a consultant to, any Person
(other than Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Affiliates) which engages in or competes with the Combined Business within
the Territory (and, in the

  



        
   

  



  

case of each of Andrew Duncan and David Northington, such Persons activity
of engaging in or competing with the Combined Business within the Territory
accounts for greater than 25% of the revenue or profit of such Person, so
long as neither Mr. Duncan nor Mr. Northington has any participation
whatsoever in any capacity (including, without limitation, as an owner,
manager, employee, advisor, consultant, officer, director, operator or
otherwise) in such Persons activity of engaging in or competing with the
Combined Business within the Territory), or (C) utilize his special knowledge
of the Combined Business or his relationships with customers, suppliers or
others to compete with the Combined Business in the Territory; _provided_ ,
_however_ , (x) nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent any Key Employee
from acquiring through market purchases and owning, solely as an investment,
less than three percent (3%) in the aggregate of the equity securities of any
class of any issuer whose shares are registered under §12(b) or 12(g) of the
Exchange Act, and are listed or admitted for trading on any United States
national securities exchange or are quoted on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, or any similar system of
automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices in common use, so
long as such Key Employee is not a member of any "control group" (within the
meaning of the rules and regulations of the SEC) of any such issuer, and (y)
the covenants in this _Section 7.6(a)_ shall automatically terminate as to
Andrew Duncan if his employment with Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective subsidiaries is terminated without Cause by Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective subsidiaries (or if Mr. Duncan
terminates his employment with any of such Persons for Good Reason) and shall
automatically terminate as to David Northington if his employment with
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective subsidiaries is
terminated without Cause by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries (or if Mr. Northington terminates his employment with
any of such Persons for Good Reason). Such Key Employee acknowledges and
agrees that the covenants in this _Section 7.6(a)_ are reasonable and
necessary in terms of time, area and line of business to protect Parents and
its subsidiaries legitimate business interests, which include their
interests in protecting their (i) valuable confidential business information,
(ii) substantial relationships with customers, suppliers and others
throughout the Territory, and (iii) goodwill associated with their ongoing
business. Such Key Employee expressly authorizes the enforcement of the
covenants provided for in this _Section 7.6(a)_ by (A) Parent and its
subsidiaries, (B) any successors to Parents and its subsidiaries business,
and (C) Parents permitted assigns. To the extent that the covenants provided
for in this _Section 7.6(a)_ may later be deemed by a court to be too broad
to be enforced with respect to its duration or with respect to any particular
activity or geographic area, the court making such determination shall have
the power to reduce the duration or scope of the provision, and to add or
delete specific words or phrases to or from the provision. The provision as
modified shall then be enforced.

  



  

(b) Without the prior written consent of Parent, such Key Employee shall not
during the Non-Compete Period, directly or indirectly, for himself or for any
other Person (other than Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates), (i) attempt to employ or enter into any contractual
arrangement with any current or former employee of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, unless such employee or
former employee has not been employed by Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective subsidiaries for a period in excess of nine (9) months,
and/or (ii) call on or solicit any of the current, former or prospective
customers or clients of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries with respect to any material facet of the Combined
Business.

  



  

(c) It is recognized and hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto that a
breach or violation by a Key Employee of any or all of the covenants and
agreements contained in _Section 7.6_  may cause irreparable harm and damage
to Parent in a monetary amount which may be virtually impossible to
ascertain. As a result, each Key Employee recognizes and hereby acknowledges
that Parent shall be entitled (without the requirement of posting a bond) to
an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and
restraining any breach or violation of any or all of the covenants and
agreements contained in _Section 7.6_ by such Key Employee and/or his
Affiliates, either directly or indirectly, and that such right to injunction
shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other rights or remedies
Parent may possess hereunder, at law or in equity. Nothing contained in this
_Section 7.6_ shall be construed to prevent Parent from seeking and
recovering from any Key Employee Damages sustained by it as a result of
any breach or violation by such Key Employee and/or his Affiliates, either
directly or indirectly, of _Section 7.6_.

  



        
   

  



  

7.7 _Tax Matters_. Each party agrees that it shall (a) unless there is a
final determination by the IRS or other applicable taxing authority, report
the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Code Section 368(a) on
its United States Tax Returns and (b) retain such records and file such
information as is required to be retained and filed pursuant to Treasury
Regulation sections 1.368-3 and 1.367(a)-3 (including, without limitation,
the reporting requirements under Treasury Regulation
section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6)) in connection with the Merger. No party shall
knowingly take any action, knowingly fail to take any action, knowingly cause
any action to be taken or knowingly cause any action to fail to be taken that
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Code Section 368(a).

grants the Owners Representative full power and authority:

therewith;

(vii) to give such instructions and to take such action or refrain from
taking such action, on behalf of such Seller, as the Owners Representative
deems, in his sole discretion, necessary or appropriate to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement.

(i) in all matters in which action by the Owners Representative is required
or permitted, the Owners Representative is authorized to act on behalf of
such Seller, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the
Owners or other Sellers or between any Seller and the Owners Representative,
and Merger Sub and Parent shall be entitled to rely on any and all action
taken

  



        
   

  



  

by the Owners Representative under this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the
Sellers, notwithstanding any knowledge on the part of Merger Sub or Parent of
any such dispute or disagreement;

  



  

(ii) notice to the Owners Representative, delivered in the manner provided
in _Section 9.5_ , shall be deemed to be notice to all the Sellers for the

(iii) the power and authority of the Owners Representative, as described in
this Agreement, shall continue in force until all rights and obligations of
the Sellers under this Agreement shall have terminated, expired or been fully
performed;

  



  

(iv) subsequent to the Effective Time, a majority in interest of the Sellers
(based on the number of shares of Adjoined capital stock owned immediately
prior to the Effective Time) shall have the right, exercisable from time to
time upon written notice delivered to the Owners Representative and Parent:
(1) to remove the Owners Representative, with or without cause; and (2) to
appoint any Seller reasonably acceptable to Parent to fill a vacancy caused
by the death, resignation or removal of the Owners Representative;

  



  

(v) a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Owners Representative
shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction from all of the
Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Sellers.
Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Owners Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
every such Seller. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any
Persons for any acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Owners Representative. In furtherance of the
foregoing, any reference to a power of the Sellers under this Agreement, to
be exercised or otherwise taken, shall be a power vested in the Owners
Representative; and

  



  

(vi) the Owners Representative shall have the right to vote (or grant a

8.4 _Indemnification and Release of Owners  Representative_. Each Seller

(except such Damages as result from the Owners Representatives gross
negligence or willful misconduct) that the Owners Representative may suffer
or incur in connection with any action or omission of the Owners
Representative in his capacity as such. Each Seller shall bear its
Proportionate Share of such Damages. The Owners Representative shall not be
liable to any Seller with respect to any action or omission taken or omitted
to be taken by the Owners Representative pursuant to this _Section
VIII_ except for the Owners Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

  



  

SECTION IX- MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

9.1 _Limitation on Liability._

  



  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Parents and its
subsidiaries sole recourse and remedy with respect to the Sellers
indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 7.3_  (other than claims for
fraud) shall be to make a claim against the Escrow Fund pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and this _Section 9.1_
and, in the case of any covenant or agreement which contemplates performance
after the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
seek specific performance or injunctive relief.

  



  

(b) (i) The Owners and other Sellers shall have no liability to indemnify
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_  or _Section 7.3(b)(i)_ (A) unless Parent or
any of its subsidiaries provides to the Owners Representative a written
notice with respect to Parents or such subsidiarys claim (including,
without limitation, a contingent claim (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
may include a contingent claim with respect to any of the matters set forth
in _Schedule 3.10_ ))on or before March 31, 2007, (B) with respect to any
liability to the extent reflected in the calculation of the Companys Working
Capital as of Closing, or (C) with respect to the Terminated Employees or
401(k) Termination.

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) Parent shall have no liability to indemnify pursuant to _Section
7.3(c)(i)_ (A) unless the Owners Representative or a Seller provides to
Parent a written notice with respect to Sellers claim on or before March 31,
2007, or (B) with respect to any liability to the extent reflected in the
calculation of the Companys Working Capital as of Closing.

  



  

(c) (i) The Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify as and to the extent set
forth in _Section 7.3_ only if the aggregate of all of their liability under
such indemnity obligations exceeds $1,650,000 (it being agreed that such
$1,650,000 figure is to serve as a "trigger" for indemnification), and then
only to the extent such aggregate exceeds $825,000, it being understood that
such $825,000 figure is to serve as a "deductible" (for example, if the
indemnity claims for which the Sellers would, but for the provisions of this
_Section 9.1(c)(i)_ , be liable aggregate $2,000,000, the Sellers would then
be liable for $1,175,000, and not $2,000,000). In addition, in no event shall
the aggregate liability of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.3_  exceed the
Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this
_Section 9.1(c)(i)_ shall not apply to (i) Sellers obligations pursuant to
_Section 1.7(f)_ , _Section 1.12_ or _Section 9.4_ , (ii) Owners obligations
arising out of or resulting from a breach or default in performance of
_Section 7.4_ , (iii) Key Employees obligations arising out of or resulting
from a breach or default in performance of _Section 7.6_ , or (iv) Sellers
obligations arising out of or resulting from a breach of, or inaccuracy in,
the last sentence of _Section 3.26_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers
shall severally (in accordance with each Sellers Proportionate Share)
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its subsidiaries from and against any
and all Damages arising out or resulting from any of the matters set forth in
_Schedule 3.10_ , and the parties further acknowledge and agree that the
limitations set forth in this _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ shall not apply to any
Damages arising out of or resulting from any of the matters set forth in
_Schedule 3.10_.

  



  

(ii) Parent shall be obligated to indemnify as and to the extent set forth in
_Section 7.3_ only if the aggregate of all of its liability under such
indemnity obligations exceeds $1,650,000 (it being agreed that such
$1,650,000 figure is to serve as a "trigger" for indemnification), and then
only to the extent such aggregate exceeds $825,000, it being understood that
such $825,000 figure is to serve as a "deductible" (for example, if the
indemnity claims for which Parent would, but for the provisions of this
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ , be liable aggregate $2,000,000, Parent would then be
liable for $1,175,000, and not $2,000,000). In addition, in no event shall
the aggregate liability of Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3_  exceed
$16,500,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ shall not apply to (i) Parents obligations pursuant to
_Section 1.7(d)_ , _Section 1.7(e)_ or _Section 1.12_ , or (ii) Parents
and/or the Surviving Companys obligations pursuant to _Section 7.5_.

  



  

(d) In the event that Parent desires to make a claim against the Sellers
under _Section 7.3_ in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or demand
at any time instituted against or made upon Parent or the Surviving Company
by any third party for which Parent may seek indemnification hereunder (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), Parent shall promptly notify the Owners
Representative in writing of such Third Party Claim and state with reasonable
specificity the circumstances of Parents claim for indemnification with
respect thereto, _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify shall
not relieve the Sellers of their obligations hereunder, except to the extent
that the Sellers are actually prejudiced by such failure. The Owners
Representative shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to notify
Parent if the Sellers have elected to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Such notice from the Owners Representative shall (i) state that the
settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim will be conducted at all times
in good faith and in a reasonable manner (and the Sellers shall so conduct
it), (ii) acknowledge the obligation to indemnify Parent in accordance with
the terms contained in this Agreement, and (iii) contain an undertaking by
the Sellers to promptly reimburse Parent and the Company for all out-of-
pocket expenses incurred as a result of the assumption by the Sellers of
control of such settlement or defense. If the Sellers elect to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Sellers shall be entitled at their own
expense to conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Third Party
Claim through counsel of their own choosing (reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) on behalf and in the name of Parent and/or the Surviving Company;
and, upon request of the Owners Representative, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall render all such assistance as the Owners Representative may
reasonably request in connection with such dispute and the defense or
settlement thereof. Parent shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of such Third

  



        
   

  



  

Party Claim with its own counsel at its own expense. The Sellers shall not
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Owners
Representative fails to notify Parent within 30 days after receipt of notice
of a Third Party Claim, Parent shall be entitled to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim at the expense of the Sellers, _provided_  that
Parent may not settle any Third Party Claim without consent of the
Owners Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(e) Parent and the Surviving Company agree to use all reasonable commercial
efforts to mitigate all Damages that could reasonably be expected to be
subject to an indemnification claim pursuant to _Section 7.3_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to pursue with
reasonable diligence all available recoveries under insurance policies and
other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person which
are contained outside this Agreement) and agree that they will not release or
permit to be released any such collateral sources from any such obligations
which they may have. If any insurance proceeds and/or other amounts are
received by Parent and/or the Surviving Company after payment by the Sellers
or the Escrow Agent of any amount otherwise required to be paid pursuant to
_Section 7.3_ , Parent and the Surviving Company shall repay to the Owners
Representative (for redelivery to the Sellers) or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, promptly after the receipt of such insurance proceeds and/or
other amounts, the excess, if any, of (i) the amount that the Sellers would
not have had to pay pursuant to _Section 7.3_ had such insurance proceeds
and/or other amounts been received by Parent and/or the Surviving Company
prior to the Sellers payment under _Section 7.3_ , over (ii) the amount of
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) and premium adjustments (whether retroactive or prospective) incurred
by Parent and the Surviving Company in their pursuit of such insurance
proceeds.

  



  

(f) The rights of the parties for indemnification relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to those
contained in _Section 7.3_ and such indemnification rights shall be the
exclusive remedies of the parties subsequent to the Effective Time with
respect to breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in this Agreement (except for fraud and the right to seek specific
performance or injunctions with respect to covenants or agreements to be
performed subsequent to the Effective Time). To the maximum extent permitted
by law, the parties hereby waive and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any such breach,
whether under any Legal Requirements, at common law or otherwise. In the
event of fraud, recourse shall only extend to those Persons committing fraud.

  



  

(g) Parent acknowledges that neither Adjoined nor any other Person has made
any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, and Parent further agrees that neither Adjoined nor
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Parent or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent, or Parents use of,
any such information, including, without limitation, any information,
document or material made available to Parent and its representatives in
management presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER ADJOINED NOR ANY OTHER PERSON
MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN
EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR
OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, AND PARENT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.

  



  

(h) Adjoined, the Owners Representative and the Owners acknowledge that
neither Parent nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, and Adjoined, the Owners Representative and the Owners
further agree that neither Parent nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability to Adjoined, the Owners Representative, the Owners
or the other Sellers or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Adjoined, or Adjoineds use of, any such information, including, without
limitation, any

  



        
   

  



  

information, document or material made available to Adjoined and its
representatives in management presentations or any other form in expectation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
PARENT NOR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF PARENT AND/OR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OPERATIONS OF PARENT AND/OR
ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ADJOINED, THE OWNERS REPRESENTATIVE AND THE OWNERS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.

  



  

(i) In connection with Parents investigation of the Company, Parent has
received from or on behalf of the Company certain estimates, forecasts, plans
and financial projections. Parent acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, forecasts, plans and financial
projections, that Parent is familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, forecasts, plans and financial projections so
furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, forecasts, plans and financial projections), and that Parent
shall have no claim against Adjoined or any other Person with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Adjoined makes no representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, forecasts, plans and financial projections
(including any such underlying assumptions).

  



  

(j) In connection with the Companys investigation of Parent, the Company has
received from or on behalf of Parent and its subsidiaries certain estimates,
forecasts, plans and financial projections. The Company, the Owners
Representative and the Owners acknowledge that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, forecasts, plans and financial
projections, that the Company, the Owners Representative and the Owners are
familiar with such uncertainties, that the Company, the Owners
Representative and the Owners are taking full responsibility for making their
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, forecasts,
plans and financial projections so furnished to the Company (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, forecasts, plans
and financial projections), and that the Company, the Owners Representative,
the Owners and the other Sellers shall have no claim against Parent or any
other Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent makes no
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, forecasts, plans
and financial projections (including any such underlying assumptions).

  



  

9.2 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective employees, agents,
accountants, legal counsel and other representatives (including their
prospective financing sources and their respective counsel) and advisers to,
hold in strict confidence all, and not divulge or disclose any, information
of any kind concerning the Company and its business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing obligation of confidence shall not apply to (i)
information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than

Affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents, accountants, legal
counsel or other representatives or advisers, (ii) information that is or

or regulation of any Governmental Authority; _provided_ that Parent
promptly shall notify the Company of any disclosure pursuant to clause (iii)

obligation of confidence shall not apply to the furnishing of information by
Parent in bona fide discussions or negotiations with prospective lenders and
their respective counsel.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives and
advisers to, hold in strict confidence all, and not divulge or disclose any,
information of any kind concerning Parent and its business; _provided_ ,

  



        
   

  



  

 _however_ , that the foregoing obligation of confidence shall not apply to

than as a result of a disclosure by the Company any of its Affiliates, or any

Share) indemnify and hold harmless Parent from and against any and all

rights and duties hereunder, then the parties will resolve such dispute in
the following manner: (i) any party may at any time deliver to the others a
written dispute notice setting forth a brief description of the issue(s) for

this _Section 9.6(a)_ ; (ii) during the thirty (30) day period following the

representatives of the various parties will meet and seek to resolve the
disputed issue(s) through negotiation, (iii) if representatives of the
parties are unable to resolve the disputed issue(s) through negotiation,

Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be
bound thereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Closing shall occur, any
of the conditions specified in _Section VI_ hereof that have not been
satisfied shall be deemed to have been waived. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

  



  

9.9 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives; but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
nothing herein shall prohibit the assignment of Parents rights and
obligations to any direct or indirect subsidiary or prohibit the assignment
of Parents rights (but not obligations) to any lender, but no
such assignment shall constitute a release of the assigning party, and the
assigning party shall continue to be bound hereby. Except for the provisions
of _Section 7.5_ hereof, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
