PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of April 3, 2007, by and between Resorts International Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller_ ") and Ameristar Casinos, Inc., a Nevada corporation (" _Buyer_ "). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in Section 9.1 hereof. 

  

 WHEREAS, Seller is the record and beneficial owner of 100% of the membership interests (the " _Interests_ ") of RIH Acquisitions IN, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (the " _Company_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company is the record and beneficial owner of 100% of the membership interests of RIH Propco IN, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (the " _Company Subsidiary_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, together with the Company Subsidiary, owns and operates Resorts East Chicago, a casino hotel located in East Chicago, Indiana (the " _Property_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Buyer, all of the Interests, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I. 

   

PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTERESTS  

  

 Section 1.1. _Purchase and Sale of Interests_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer free and clear of all Liens (other than restrictions to which Buyer may be subject under applicable securities laws and Gaming Laws), and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Interests for an aggregate purchase price of Six Hundred Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($675,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 1.6. The Purchase Price (less the Deposit, as set forth in Section 1.2) shall be delivered to Seller in immediately available funds on the Closing Date to a United States bank account designated by Seller (or Sellers designated "qualified intermediary") in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 1.2. _Deposit_. 

   

 (a) On the date hereof, Buyer shall deposit Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (collectively with any additional amounts delivered by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof, the " _Deposit_ ") with First American Title Insurance Company of NY (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to an escrow agreement dated as of the date hereof and attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_ ") executed and delivered by Seller, 

   ##### 

  

    

Buyer and the Escrow Agent. Upon the Closing, (i) the Deposit shall be paid to
Seller (or Sellers designated "qualified intermediary") and credited against
the Purchase Price, (ii) the interest accrued on the Deposit shall be paid to
the Buyer, and (iii) the Deposit and the accrued interest thereon shall be
promptly released by the Escrow Agent to Seller (or Sellers designated
"qualified intermediary") and Buyer, respectively, pursuant to this Section
1.2(a) and the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement. Upon the termination of
this Agreement, the Deposit and the interest accrued thereon shall be payable
pursuant to Section 6.2(c) hereof, and thereafter shall be promptly released
by the Escrow Agent to Buyer or Seller (or Sellers designated "qualified
intermediary"), as applicable, pursuant to such Section 6.2(c) hereof and the
terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (b) Seller and Buyer agree to execute and be bound by such other reasonable and customary escrow instructions as may be necessary or reasonably required by the Escrow Agent or the parties hereto in order to consummate the purchase and sale contemplated herein, or otherwise to distribute and pay the funds held in escrow as provided in this Agreement and the Deposit Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that such escrow instructions are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Deposit Escrow Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and provisions of such supplemental escrow instructions and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or any inconsistency between the terms and provisions of the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall control, absent an express written agreement between the parties hereto to the contrary which acknowledges this Section 1.2(b). 

  

 Section 1.3. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The purchase and sale of the Interests pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated, for federal and applicable state income tax purposes, as a purchase by Buyer of the assets of the Company (other than the interests in the Company Subsidiary owned by the Company) and the Company Subsidiary. Between the date hereof and the Due Diligence Date, the parties hereto will cooperate in good faith to agree upon a schedule allocating the Purchase Price (as determined for federal income tax purposes, including any assumed Liabilities that are required to be treated as part of the Purchase Price for federal income tax purposes) among such assets, and such schedule shall be attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_. If the parties have agreed upon _Exhibit B_ prior to the Due Diligence Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer within thirty (30) Business Days of the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement a purchase price allocation (" _Seller s Allocation_") that conforms to the principles of such _Exhibit B_. Buyer shall accept and agree to Sellers Allocation unless Buyer, acting in good faith, objects to Sellers Allocation, in which case Buyer shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of Sellers Allocation, deliver written notice to Seller of such objection. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the items in Sellers Allocation to which Buyer objects and the basis for such objection. In the event that the parties cannot mutually agree upon a resolution with respect to such disputed items within fifteen (15) Business Days of Sellers receipt of such notice, such disagreement shall be treated in the same manner as a disagreement described in Section 1.6(c), shall be resolved consistently with the manner in which disputes described in Section 1.6(c) are resolved and such resolution(s) will be reflected on the purchase price allocation. Buyer and Seller agree to (a) be bound by the purchase price allocation, if any, established in accordance with this Section 1.3, as it may be adjusted for changes resulting from adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.6 (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "), (b) 

   ##### 

  

    

act in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation in the filing of all Tax
Returns (including, without limitation, filing IRS Form 8594 (and any
supplemental or amended Form 8594) with their United States federal income
Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date) and in the
course of any Tax audit, Tax examination or Tax litigation relating thereto,
and (c) take no position and cause its Affiliates to take no position
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon 
_Exhibit B_ prior to the Due Diligence Date, each party shall be free to
allocate the Purchase Price (as determined for federal income tax purposes,
including any assumed Liabilities that are required to be treated as part of
the Purchase Price for federal income tax purposes) as it determines, and
neither party shall be bound by the other partys allocation. 

  

 Section 1.4. _Time and Place of Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VI hereof, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the purchase and sale of the Interests (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place on the third Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in Article V hereof (other than those conditions intended to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time or place shall be agreed to by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that in the event Buyer has not obtained all required Gaming Approvals and all the other conditions set forth in Article V hereof have been satisfied or waived, the Closing shall take place on the third Business Day following Buyers receipt of all required Gaming Approvals, subject to Buyers and Sellers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof; _provided, further,_ that the Closing Date shall not be after the date that is six (6) months after the date hereof (the " _Scheduled Closing Date_ "), unless: 

   

 (a) Buyer deposits with the Escrow Agent an additional Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,500,000) (which amount shall thereafter be included in the Deposit for all purposes of this Agreement); and 

   

 (b) Buyer has not received all required Gaming Approvals on or before three (3) Business Days before the Scheduled Closing Date; in which case the Closing Date shall be extended to the earlier of: 

   

 (i) three (3) Business Days after Buyer receives all required Gaming Approvals; and 

   

 (ii) ninety (90) days after the Scheduled Closing Date (the " _Extended Closing Date_ "); _provided, further,_ that the Closing Date shall not be after the Extended Closing Date, unless: 

  

       | (1)  |   | Buyer deposits with the Escrow Agent
an additional Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,500,000) (which amount shall thereafter be included in the Deposit for
all purposes of this Agreement); and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (2)  |   | Buyer has not received all required
Gaming Approvals on or before three (3) Business Days before the
Extended Closing Date; in which case the Closing Date shall be extended to
the earlier of:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (A)  |   | three (3) Business Days after Buyer receives the
required Gaming Approvals; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | ninety (90) days after the Extended Closing Date.  
   

  

 Section 1.5. _Deliveries at Closing_. The following documents will be executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller, as applicable, at or prior to the Closing: 

   

 (a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the certificates required by Sections 5.3(b) and (c) hereof. 

   

 (b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the certificates required by Sections 5.2(a), (b) and (c) hereof and the materials described in Sections 5.2(d) and (e). 

   

 (c) Seller shall deliver to Buyer certificate(s) representing the Interests duly endorsed by Seller for transfer to Buyer or accompanied by membership interest powers for the Interests duly executed by Seller, in proper form for transfer. 

   

 (d) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certification, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, to the effect that Seller is not, and its assets are not treated as owned by, a foreign person as such term is defined in Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code. 

   

 (e) Each party shall deliver any other documents, instruments or agreements which are reasonably requested by another party that are reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and have not previously been delivered. 

  

 Section 1.6. _Purchase Price Adjustments_. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable but in any event within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") showing Buyers calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital, including, in each case, the calculation thereof in reasonable detail. Buyer shall provide to Seller such back-up or supporting data relating to the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculations of Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital reflected thereon as Seller may reasonably request. Buyer shall also provide Seller and its officers, directors, employees, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") with such reasonable access to the books, records and personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiary, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, as Seller may reasonably request for the purposes of evaluating the Post-Closing Statement and Buyers calculations of Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital. 

   

 (b) Seller shall, within the thirty (30) day period (the " _Acceptance Period_ ") following receipt of such Post-Closing Statement, notify Buyer of its acceptance or non-acceptance (as the case may be) of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Cash and 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Working Capital reflected thereon. If no such notice is delivered to
Buyer by Seller within the Acceptance Period, the Post-Closing Statement and
the calculations of Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital reflected
thereon shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and shall be binding
thereon for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Post-Closing Statement and
the calculations of Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital reflected thereon
are accepted or deemed to have been accepted by Seller, then payment of any
related amounts, as contemplated by this Section 1.6(b), shall be made
pursuant to Sections 1.6(d) and (e) below. If Seller gives notice (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within the Acceptance Period that Seller does
not agree with or otherwise does not accept the calculation of Closing Cash
or Closing Working Capital reflected on the Post-Closing Statement, Seller
shall describe in such Dispute Notice, in reasonable detail, the basis for
its disagreement. Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve
all such disagreements within the thirty (30) Business Day period (the "
_Negotiating Period_ ") following the delivery by Seller of such
Dispute Notice. 

   

 (c) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreements regarding the Post-Closing Statement and the calculations reflected thereon within the Negotiating Period, then all such disputes shall be promptly referred to Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm declines to serve, then such other independent accounting firm as is mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the " _Neutral Accounting Firm_ "). The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed only to resolve all outstanding disagreements relating to the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital reflected thereon, and shall be instructed not to otherwise investigate such matters independently. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall investigate only those items which are in dispute and shall not assign a value to any item that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either of Buyer or Seller or (B) lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by either of Buyer or Seller. The Neutral Accounting Firms determination shall be based only upon written submissions by Buyer and Seller, and not upon an independent review by the Neutral Accounting Firm. The parties shall instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm to render its determination within thirty (30) Business Days of the referral of such matter thereto, and the determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller for all purposes of this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Neutral Accounting Firm without the prior consent of Buyer (in the case of Seller) or Seller (in the case of Buyer). The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be borne one-half by Buyer, on the one hand, and one-half by Seller, on the other hand. 

   

 (d) Promptly following the final resolution of all disputes, if any, relating to the Post-Closing Statement calculations and amounts reflected thereon in accordance with this Section 1.6, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter, (A) if the finally-determined amount of Closing Cash exceeds the Target Closing Cash, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated by Seller to Buyer in writing, an amount equal to such difference or (B) if the finally-determined amount of Closing Cash is less than the Target Closing Cash, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated by Buyer to Seller in writing, an amount equal to such difference. Any amounts paid under this Section 1.6(d) shall be paid together with interest 

   ##### 

  

    

thereon at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate set forth in _The Wall
Street Journal_ s Table of Interest Rates and Bonds on the date that payment
is to be made, calculated from the Closing Date through the date on which

Subject to compliance with applicable Law (including, without limitation, antitrust Laws and Gaming Laws), from the date hereof until the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more Representatives of the other party to report on the general status of ongoing operations of the Property. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing of, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event, transaction or circumstance, as soon as practical after it becomes known to such party, that causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Seller or of Buyer under this Agreement to be breached in any material respect or that renders or will render untrue in any material respect any representation or warranty of Seller or Buyer contained in this Agreement. Nothing contained in Section 4.1 hereof shall prevent Seller from giving such notice, using such efforts or taking any action to cure or curing any such event, transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein. 

  

 Section 4.3. _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1 hereof, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, through any of its Representatives or Affiliates (i) solicit, encourage, facilitate or initiate any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person (or group of Persons) other than Buyer or its respective Affiliates concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person or entity relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into an agreement for an Acquisition Proposal.

 (c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, other than those Employees set forth on Section 4.3(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Seller shall not transfer any Employees to any other property owned or operated by Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates without Buyers prior written consent, and for a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Seller shall not 

   #####

advertising or solicitation not specifically targeting any Employee and
may employ Persons responding to such general employment advertising or
solicitation and Persons who seek employment with Seller or any of its
Affiliates without solicitation. 

  

 Section 4.4. _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Buyer or one or more of their respective Affiliates will provide current Employees (other than those employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) as of the Closing Date who continue employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with cash compensation that is no less favorable in the aggregate than that provided by Seller and/or the Company and in effect at the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, or legal Representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to continuing employment for any specified period or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, unless otherwise provided by applicable Law, and nothing in Agreement shall alter the at-will employment status of any such employee. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiary) to maintain or continue any of the Company Benefit Plans for any specified period. 

   

 (b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, for all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates before the Closing Date (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its Affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, if any, except for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for any purpose where service credit for the applicable period is not provided to participants generally, and to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) each Continuing Employee immediately will be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Post-Closing Plans to the extent coverage under such Post-Closing Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Buyer will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (iii) Buyer will cause any eligible expenses incurred 

   ##### 

  

    

by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Pre-Closing Plan ending on the date such
Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding Post-Closing
Plan begins to be taken into account under such Post-Closing Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Post-Closing Plan. 

  

 Section 4.5. _Access to Information and the Property_. 

   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable Law, including without limitation, antitrust Laws and Gaming Laws, Seller shall (and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary and their respective Representatives, to) provide Buyers Representatives with reasonable access and cooperation, during normal business hours during the period from the date hereof to the Closing, to the Property, including without limitation, access and cooperation with respect to (1) its data center facilities for hardware and software deployment, training, testing and pre-cutover systems engineering to facilitate a timely systems transition at the Transfer Time of the Companys operating functions, including payroll, general ledger and other accounting functions, and (2) all its personnel, properties, books, Contracts and records, and, during such period, Seller shall furnish promptly to Buyer (x) all unaudited monthly financial information in the form filed with the Indiana Gaming Commission, (y) to the extent otherwise prepared, unaudited consolidated financial information with respect to each quarterly fiscal period ended more than 45 days prior to the Closing Date and (z) all other information concerning the business and operation of the Property and the Employees as Buyer may reasonably request and Buyer shall have the right to reasonable office or other space at the Property for transition purposes for the period commencing on the Due Diligence Date until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date upon which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1 (collectively, the " _Inspection_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer shall provide Seller with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice of any Inspection; (ii) if Seller so requests, Buyers Representatives shall be accompanied by a Representative of Seller; (iii) Buyer shall not initiate contact with Employees or other Representatives of the Company or the Company Subsidiary other than Sellers Representatives set forth on Section 4.5 of the Seller Disclosure Letter without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and, at Sellers option, one of Sellers Representatives, an employers Representative or other agent of Seller shall be present at all Inspections); (iv) Buyers Representatives shall not be entitled to perform any physical testing of any nature with respect to any portion of the Property without Sellers prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that such consent may be withheld if in the reasonable judgment of Sellers Representatives such testing would materially interfere with the operation of the business conducted at the Property); (v) Buyer shall not materially interfere with the operation of the business conducted at the Property; and (vi) Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly repair any physical damage to the Property or any other property owned by a Person other than Buyer arising from or caused by Inspection, and restore the Property or such other third-party property to substantially the same condition as existed prior to such Inspection, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any personal 

   ##### 

  

    

injury or physical property damage claims, liabilities, judgments or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any of them arising
or resulting therefrom. Buyer will hold and cause its Representatives to hold
any such information furnished to it by Seller which is nonpublic in
confidence in accordance with the confidentiality agreement dated March 26,
2007, between Seller and Buyer (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that subsequent to the Closing Date, the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive only with respect to Information
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) provided with respect to the
Seller or its Affiliates, other than the Company or the Company Subsidiary,
and that after the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall no
longer apply to any Information (as defined in the Confidentiality agreement)
provided in respect of any other matters, including, without limitation, the
Property. The Confidentiality Agreement, as modified by the
immediately preceding sentence, shall survive the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1 and continue in full force and
effect thereafter. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein, unless such information is disclosed in a supplement to the Seller
Disclosure Letter in accordance with Section 4.25. 

   

 (b) Following the Closing, (x) to the extent reasonably necessary for Seller to pursue any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation relating to claims in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon reasonable notice, Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary and their respective Representatives, to) provide Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives, during normal business hours and on reasonable notice, with reasonable access (including duplicating rights) and cooperation with respect to all of Buyers personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records related solely to the Company and the Company Subsidiary and (y) for a period of two (2) months commencing on the Closing Date, Seller shall have the right to reasonable office or other space at the Property for at least one person for transition purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller shall provide Buyer with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice; (ii) if Buyer so requests, Sellers Representatives shall be accompanied by a Representative of Buyer; (iii) Seller shall not materially interfere with the operation of the business conducted at the Property; and (iv) Buyer shall not be required to incur any costs in connection with the rights granted to Seller in this Section 4.5(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to provide any information which (i) it reasonably believes it may not provide to Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives by reason of applicable Law or by a confidentiality agreement with a third party if, in the case of a confidentiality agreement, Buyer has used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such party to such disclosure, or (ii) constitutes information protected by the attorney/client and/or attorney work product privilege. If any material is withheld by Buyer pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall inform Seller as to the general nature of the material which is being withheld. Seller shall keep confidential, and shall take reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to keep confidential, (i) any and all non-public information concerning Buyer provided to Seller or its Representatives by Buyer and (ii) any and all non-public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiary. Seller recognizes and agrees that in the event of a breach by it of this Section 4.5(b), money damages would not be an adequate remedy to Buyer for such breach and, even if money 

   ##### 

  

    

damages were adequate, it would be impossible to ascertain or measure with any
degree of accuracy the damages sustained by Buyer therefrom. Accordingly, if
there should be a breach or threatened breach by Seller of the provisions of
this Section 4.5(b), Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction restraining
Seller from any breach without showing or proving actual damage sustained by
Buyer. 

   

 (c) In accordance with applicable Gaming Laws, Buyer shall retain, and cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary after the Closing to retain, all books and records which are in the Companys or the Company Subsidiarys possession at the Closing for a period of at least five (5) years from the Closing Date or such further period as may be required by applicable Gaming Laws.

Buyer and Seller and their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall file (x) within fifteen (15) days after the Due Diligence Date, all required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining the approvals under the HSR Act, (y) within sixty (60) days after the Due Diligence Date, all required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining the approvals under applicable Gaming Laws and (z) as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, all Governmental Approvals other than those set forth in subclause (x) or (y) and shall act diligently and promptly to pursue the Governmental Approvals and shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all filings referenced in the preceding sentence, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties hereto and their advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to schedule and attend any hearings or meetings with Governmental Entities to obtain the Governmental Approvals as promptly as possible. Buyer and Seller shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult all of the parties hereto on, in each case, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (including, without limitation, antitrust laws and any Gaming Laws), all the information relating to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and any of their 

   ##### 

  

    

respective Affiliates or Representatives which appear in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions governed by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will notify all of the other parties
hereto promptly of the receipt of material comments or requests from
Governmental Entities relating to Governmental Approvals, and will supply all
of the other parties hereto with copies of all material correspondence
between the notifying party or any of its Representatives and Governmental
Entities with respect to Governmental Approvals. 

   

 (b) Without limiting Section 4.6(a) hereof, Buyer and Seller shall: 

   

 (i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date, including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person; and 

   

 (ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Closing so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including implementing, contesting or resisting any litigation before any court or quasi-judicial administrative tribunal seeking to restrain or enjoin the Closing; 

   

 (c) Buyer and Seller shall promptly advise each of the other parties hereto upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions governed by this Agreement which causes such party to reasonably believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that such consent or approval from such Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. Buyer and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions governed by this Agreement, seeking to prevent the entry by any Governmental Entity of any decree, injunction or other order challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions governed by this Agreement, appealing as promptly as possible any such decree, injunction or other order and having any such decree, injunction or other order vacated or reversed. 

   

 (d) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each party shall promptly notify all other parties hereto in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking damages in connection with the Closing of any transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Closing. 

  

 Section 4.7. _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer shall agree on the form and content of the initial press release regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter shall consult with all of the other party hereto before issuing, provide each other the opportunity to review and 

   ##### 

  

    

comment upon and use all reasonable efforts to agree upon, any press release
or other public statement with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation and prior to considering in
good faith any such comments, except as may be required by applicable Law
(including without limitation regulations of the NASDAQ stock market, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any Gaming Laws). The commenting party
shall provide any such comments in a timely manner such that the party
issuing such press release or other public statement shall have a commercially
reasonable period of time to respond to such comments prior to any deadline
imposed by such applicable Law in respect of such press release or other
public statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates may make any public statement
in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Buyer and Seller and
do not reveal non-public information regarding Buyer or Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates. 

  

 Section 4.8. _Further Assurances and Actions_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, using their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities and parties to Contracts with each party hereto as are necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) fulfill all conditions precedent applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement.

 (b) _Frequent Player Award Programs_.

Any failure to submit any such notice of claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure. 

  

 Section 7.5. _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against an Indemnified Party by any third party (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification under this Article VII may be sought, Notice thereof shall be given to the Indemnifying Party and to all the other parties hereto as promptly as practicable. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure. With respect to any Third Party Claim (a) that does not seek solely equitable relief and (b) that involves Damages for which the Indemnifying Party may be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII after application of the limitations set forth in Section 7.6, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so elects at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim, (ii) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice (provided that such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) to handle and defend the same, unless the named parties to such action or proceeding include both one or more Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying Party, in which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel (provided that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and (iii) to compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only (x) with the written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or (y) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom _; provided, however,_ that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of the Third Party Claim if (1) the Persons against whom the claim is made, or any impleaded Persons, include both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party, and (2) representation of both such Persons by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case any Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend the Third Party Claim and to employ counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted
will have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable
cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that such claim shall not be compromised or
settled without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise
or settlement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.6(a) shall not apply to any claims for indemnification in respect of any breach of Sections 2.2(a), 2.3, 2.6(d), 2.17, 2.18, 3.2(a) and 3.3, as applicable. 

   

 (b) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of the Damages (i) shall not be duplicative of any other Damage for which an indemnification claim has been made, (ii) shall be computed net of any amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to such Damages (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds) and (iii) shall be computed net of any amounts that were taken into account in the calculation of Closing Working Capital to the extent that such amounts (A) related to the subject matter of such Damages and (B) were in favor of the applicable Indemnified Party. If an Indemnifying Party pays an Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently insurance proceeds in respect of such claim are collected by the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party promptly shall remit the insurance proceeds (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds) to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however,_ that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to remit any proceeds in excess of the amount actually paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VII in connection with the related claim for 

   ##### 

  

    

indemnification. The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from any applicable insurance company any insurance
proceeds in respect of any claim for which the Indemnified Parties seek
indemnification under this Article VII. 

  

 Section 7.7. _Payment of Damages_. An Indemnified Party (or Sellers designated "qualified intermediary") shall be paid in cash by an Indemnifying Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party (or Sellers designated "qualified intermediary") may become entitled by reason of the provisions of this Article VII, within fifteen (15) days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of the parties or on the date on which both such amount and an Indemnified Partys obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final judgment of a court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such proceeding. 

  

 Section 7.8. _Exclusive Remedy_. 

   

 (a) Except as specifically set forth in Sections 4.5, 4.13, 4.17, 4.18 and 4.24, after the Closing, the indemnities provided in this Article VII shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with any claims regarding matters arising under or otherwise relating to this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that this exclusive remedy for Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller each hereby waive (and, by their acceptance of the benefits under this Agreement, each Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller Indemnified Party hereby waives), from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or willful misconduct) such party may have against the other party hereto arising under or based upon this Agreement or any schedule, exhibit, Disclosure Letter, document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, and no legal action sounding in tort, statute or strict liability may be maintained by any party (other than a legal action brought solely to enforce the provisions of this Article VII). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.8, in the event of a fraud or any willful breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein by Buyer or Seller, any Indemnified Party shall have all remedies available at law or in equity with respect thereto. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereby waive and agree not to seek (whether under any Environmental Law or otherwise) any statutory or common law remedy (whether for contribution, equitable indemnity or otherwise) against any Indemnifying Party with regard to any Environmental Condition or Environmental Liability.

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.8. _Assignment_. Except as provided in Section 4.24 hereof, without the prior written consent of all of the parties hereto, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by operation of Law (including, without limitation, by merger or consolidation) or otherwise. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of its rights, interests and (except with respect to clause (i) below) obligations under this Agreement (i) to the banks or other lenders (or any agent therefor) providing the debt financing to be incurred by Buyer in connection with the Closing for security purposes, or (ii) to any controlled Affiliate (so long as such Affiliate remains at all times thereafter an Affiliate of Buyer); _provided, however,_ that such assignment shall not be valid under this Agreement unless (a) such Affiliate assumes all of Buyers agreements and obligations hereunder, (b) no such assignment shall relieve Buyer from any of its agreements and obligations hereunder, and (c) no such assignment in any way (x) shall adversely affect the ability to receive, or delay the receipt of, the Gaming Approvals or antitrust approvals contemplated by this Agreement or (y) shall adversely affect or delay the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any assignment in violation of this Section 9.8 shall be void. 

  

 Section 9.9. _Parties of Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and/or in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 Section 9.11. _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. In the event of any ambiguity or question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors may, to the extent legally allowed (i) extend the time for or waive the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant herein and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained here. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. 

  

 Section 9.14. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to this Agreement and all terms, provisions, covenants and conditions herein. 

  

 Section 9.15. _Disclosure Letters_. The Seller Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Agreement and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the face of the statement that it is applicable. The Buyer Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Agreement and the disclosure in any paragraph shall, to the extent applicable, qualify other paragraphs in this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the face of the statement that it is applicable.
