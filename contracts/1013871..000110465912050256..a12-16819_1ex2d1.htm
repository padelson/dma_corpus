refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings

thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of

from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession
of comparable successor statutes. References in this Agreement to specific
laws or to specific provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. The word "extent" and the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and not simply "if."

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _THE MERGER_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, NY 10022 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ")
that is the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
action taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent
may agree in writing.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file the certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "),
executed in accordance with, and

 



      
 

 



 

containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as is
agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such date and time is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided
under the DGCL.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended in the
Merger to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub in effect immediately prior to the Merger (except that the name of the
corporation shall be "GenOn Energy, Inc." and with such modifications as may
be required by _Section 6.11_), and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended in the Merger to read in their
entirety in the form of the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Merger (except that the name of the corporation shall be "GenOn
Energy, Inc." and with such modifications as may be required by _Section
6.11_), and as so amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof
and applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the receipt of Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent shall take
all necessary actions to cause the Parent Charter Amendment to become
effective at or immediately following the Effective Time, and Parents Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended by the Parent Charter
Amendment, shall be the certificate of incorporation of Parent until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall take all necessary actions to cause the by-laws of Parent to
be amended and restated as of the Effective Time in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit B_ (with such changes as necessary to reflect the applicable
provisions based on the actual Closing Date).

 



 

Section 2.9 _Alternative Structures_. The parties agree to reasonably
cooperate in the consideration and implementation of alternative structures to
effect the business combination contemplated by this Agreement as long as any
such alternative structure does not (a) impose any material delay on, or
condition to, the consummation of the Merger, (b) cause any condition set
forth in _Article VII_ to not be capable of being satisfied (unless duly
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof), or (c) adversely affect
any of the parties hereto or either of the parties stockholders.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 3.1(b)_ and
_3.1(d)_ , each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per
share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each such share, a " _Share_ "), excluding any
Cancelled Shares, shall at the Effective Time automatically be converted into
the right to receive, 0.1216 **** (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly or indirectly
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time or held directly or indirectly by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case,
other than the Reserved Shares and any other Shares held by such Persons on
behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of any Person, be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
for such cancellation.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each former holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) will be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 3.1(d)_, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent
Common Stock representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the
Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ over (B) the aggregate number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Shares
pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent
for the holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing
prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided
in _Section 3.1(d)(ii)_.

 



 

(ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms
of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the
holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each former holder
of Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying (A) the amount of the
aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by (B) a fraction, (x)
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such former holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and (y) the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Shares would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of shares of Parent Common Stock without interest, subject to and
in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(e) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent (or any other
securities convertible therefor or

 



      
 

 



 

exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration
and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide
to Parent, Merger Sub and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and thereafter, all
references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall be references to
the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 3.1(e)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto
to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance
or distribution of Reserved Shares shall not give rise to any adjustment under
the terms of this _Section 3.1(e)_.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the Merger Consideration. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares and the
Company RSUs, shares of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form issuable
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to
make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)_. All book-entries representing shares of Parent Common Stock
(including the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_) are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
transmit (or mail in the case of certificated Shares) to each former holder of
Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that
risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_. Upon surrender of Shares for
cancellation and exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (which shall be in
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested),
payment by check in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, and the
Shares so surrendered shall

 



      
 

 



 

forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Share be in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration
in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.2(b)_, each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts
to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ or _Section 3.2(c)_) upon such
surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ or _Section 3.2(c)_.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_, until such Share has
been surrendered in accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to applicable
Law, following surrender of any such Share, there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor
pursuant to this _Article III_, together with any cash payable in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and the amount of any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date (if any), the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ and any
cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ or _Section 3.2(c)_ shall be deemed
to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article _III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. The Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any former holder of Shares or
holder of Company RSUs, such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax
Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holder of the
Company RSUs, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 



 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate
formerly representing Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of
such certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.3 _No Dissenters  Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in (1) any Company SEC Documents filed with or furnished
to the SEC at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof (excluding any
disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" or "forward looking statements"
section) where the relevance of the information as an exception to (or
disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure ( _provided_ , that this clause (1) shall not
apply to any representations or warranties set forth in _Section 4.2_) and
including for these purposes any document included in the exhibit list in any
Company SEC Document, or (2) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation, warranty or covenant if specified therein and such other
representations, warranties or covenants where its relevance as an exception
to (or disclosure for purposes of) such other representation, warranty or
covenant is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure, the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

is bound. The Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power

is bound, and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The Company has publicly filed with the SEC or made available to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the Companys
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended through the date
hereof (collectively, the " _Company Organizational Documents_ ").

 



 

Section 4.2 _Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 2,000,000,000

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting

of Directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee
thereof) in compliance with all applicable Law and recorded on the

otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interest)
that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of such
Subsidiarys business as presently conducted. No Subsidiary of the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, any Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock.

Section 4.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since
January 1, 2011 (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Companys Subsidiaries, except GenOn Americas Generation, LLC and GenOn Mid-
Atlantic, LLC, is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective
periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto), and (iii) have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto). The books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have been and are being maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has or is subject to any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Securities Act), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any transaction involving, or
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiarys in the Companys or
such Subsidiarys published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "). The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. No executive officer of the Company has failed to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Document, except as
disclosed in certifications filed with the Company SEC Documents. Neither the
Company nor any of its executive officers has received notice from any
Governmental Entity challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing of such certifications. Since the enactment of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made
or permitted to remain outstanding any

 



      
 

 



 

prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule
3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

31, 2011 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
(d) for liabilities or obligations which have been discharged or paid in full
in the ordinary course of business, as of the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other
than those which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2010
have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of
any applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, Order or agency requirement of any Governmental Entity or any
common law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such
non-compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or, to the Companys Knowledge, other communication from
any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or
failure to comply with, any Law, except as would not reasonably be expected to

grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,

Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Company
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are valid
and in full force and effect, and no suspension or cancellation of any such
Company Permits is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect or for such suspensions or
cancellations that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all respects with the terms and
requirements of such Company Permits, except where the failure to be in
compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.13 _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries that engages in the sale of electricity
at wholesale (other than any such Subsidiaries that own one or more facilities
that constitute a "qualifying facility" as such term is defined under PURPA
and the rules and regulations of FERC that are entitled to exemption from
regulation under Section 205 of the FPA) is regulated as a "public utility"
under the FPA and has been authorized by the FERC, pursuant to the FPA, to
make such sales at market-based rates. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries that
directly owns generating facilities has obtained an order from the FERC
finding it to be, or has self-certified itself to the FERC as, an Exempt
Wholesale Generator under either the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 or the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (" _PUHCA 2005_ ") or
has obtained an order from the FERC finding it to be, or has self-certified
itself to the FERC as, a qualifying facility under PURPA. Neither Company, nor
any of its Subsidiaries, are subject to the books and records requirements of
Part 366 of the FERCs Rules and Regulations (18 C.F.R. Part 366 (2009)).
There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, judicial
or administrative proceedings to revoke a Subsidiarys market-based rate
authorization, Exempt Wholesale Generator status or qualifying facility
status, as applicable. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no events,
facts or conditions that are reasonably likely to cause any of the Companys
Subsidiaries that sell electricity at wholesale to lose its market-based rate
authorization or any of the Companys Subsidiaries that directly owns
generating facilities to lose its status as an Exempt Wholesale Generator
under PUHCA 2005. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns,
directly or indirectly, any interest in any nuclear generation station or
manages or operates any nuclear generation station.

during the three years preceding the date hereof, with the FERC under the FPA
or PUHCA 2005, the Department of Energy or any applicable state public utility

supplements appertaining thereto, including all rates, tariffs and related
documents, and all such filings complied, as of their respective dates, with
all applicable

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of applicable Law, except for filings the failure of which to
make or the failure of which to make in compliance with all applicable Law,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100

the Surviving Corporation of such Subsidiarys business as presently
conducted.

 



 

(h) Neither the execution of this Agreement (including the public announcement
thereof) nor the consummation of the Merger, will result in (i) a "potential
adjustment event" (as defined in the Certificate of Designations for the
Parent 3.625% Preferred Stock) under the Certificate of Designations for the

Section 5.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2011 (the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Parents
Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then
ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein, including
the notes thereto), and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto). The books and records of Parent
and its Subsidiaries have been and are being maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has or is subject to any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in

 



      
 

 



 

Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any transaction involving, or liabilities of, Parent or any of
its Subsidiarys in Parents or such Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. No executive officer of Parent has failed
to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes Oxley Act with respect to any Parent SEC Document, except as
disclosed in certifications filed with the Parent SEC Documents. Neither
Parent nor any of its executive officers has received notice from any
Governmental Entity challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing of such certifications. Since the enactment of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or
permitted to remain outstanding any prohibited loans to any executive officer
of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

against in Parents consolidated balance sheets (or the notes thereto)

Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31,
2011 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (d)
for liabilities or obligations which have been discharged or paid in full in
the ordinary course of business, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries), except where the failure to be in compliance would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

cancellation of any such STNP Permits is pending or, threatened, except where
the failure to be in full force and effect or for such suspensions or
cancellations that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.13 _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parents Subsidiaries that engages in the sale of electricity at
wholesale (other than any such Subsidiaries that own one or more facilities
that constitute a "qualifying facility" as such term is defined under PURPA
and the rules and regulations of FERC that are entitled to exemption from
regulation under Section 205 of the FPA) is (i) regulated as a "public
utility" under the FPA and has been authorized by the FERC, pursuant to the
FPA, to make such sales at market-based rates or (ii) located within ERCOT and
regulated by the PUCT. Each of Parents Subsidiaries that directly owns
generating facilities has obtained an order from the FERC finding it to be, or
has self-certified itself to the FERC as, or is entitled to exemption from
regulation as an Exempt Wholesale Generator under either the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 or PUHCA 2005 or has obtained an order from the
FERC finding it to be, has self-certified itself to the FERC as, or is a solar
facility of less than one MW that is entitled to exemption from regulation as,
a qualifying facility under PURPA. Neither Parent, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, are subject to the books and records requirements of Part 366 of
the FERCs Rules and Regulations (18 C.F.R. Part 366 (2009)). There are no
pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, judicial or administrative
proceedings to revoke a Subsidiarys market-based rate authorization, Exempt
Wholesale Generator status or qualifying facility status, as applicable. To
the Knowledge of Parent, there are no events, facts or conditions that are
reasonably likely to cause any of Parents Subsidiaries that sell electricity
at wholesale to lose its market-based rate authorization or any of Parents
Subsidiaries that directly owns generating facilities to lose its status as an
Exempt Wholesale Generator under PUHCA 2005.

commissions, as the case may be, have been made, including all forms,
statements, reports, agreements and all documents, exhibits, amendments and
supplements appertaining thereto, including all rates, tariffs and related
documents, and all such filings complied, as of their respective dates, with
all applicable requirements of applicable Law, except for filings the failure
of which to make or the failure of which to make in compliance with all

to, or that would be reasonably likely to lead to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) request that each such

 



      
 

 



 

Third Party and its Representatives promptly return or destroy all

Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, effect a Company Change of Recommendation in connection
with or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, such actions will nonetheless constitute a Company Change
of Recommendation) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_,
if (but only if):

 



 

(i) a _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal is received by the
Company or its directors, officers, employees or Representatives from a Third
Party after the execution and delivery of this Agreement which did not result
from, arise in connection with a breach of this _Section 6.4_ and such
Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn;

 



 

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Offer;

 



 

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company

8.1(j)_ with respect to such Company Superior Offer would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the exercise of the Board of Directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;

providing the information described in _clauses (A)_ through _(C)_ of
_Section 6.4(b)_ with respect to such Company Superior Offer ( _mutatis
mutandis_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that any change to the

 



      
 

 



 

financial terms or any other material change to the terms and conditions of
any such Company Superior Offer shall require a new written notice to be
delivered by the Company to Parent and the Company shall be required to comply
again with the requirements of this _Section 6.4(e)_ ( _provided_ , that
references to the four Business Day period above shall be deemed to refer to a
three Business Day period in connection with the delivery of any such new

Company again determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, and

of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the Company Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Company Superior Offer and that the failure to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation, or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_, with respect to such Company Superior Offer
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise of the Board
of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, take the actions described in _clause (i)_ of _Section
6.4(d)_, not in connection with or in any way relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
actions will nonetheless constitute a Company Change of Recommendation), if
(but only if):

 



 

(i) any material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after
the date hereof that was neither known to the Board of Directors of the
Company nor reasonably foreseeable at the date of this Agreement (and which
change or development does not relate to a Company Acquisition Proposal);

 



 

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation with respect to such development or change in
circumstances would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise
of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(iii) the Company provides Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice stating that the Company will effect a Company Change of Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 6.4(f)_ after the expiration of such four Business

the requirements of this _Section 6.4(f)_ ( _provided_ , that references to
the four Business Day period above shall be deemed to refer to a three
Business Day period in connection with the delivery of any such new notice);
and

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) at the end of such four Business Day period described in _clause (iii)_
(or three Business Day period, as applicable), the Board of Directors of the
Company again determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the failure to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation with respect to such development or
change in circumstances would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
exercise of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) The approval of the Companys Board of Directors or any committee thereof
for purposes of causing the Charter Restrictions, the DGCL 203 Restrictions
and any other Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other

Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger and to
exempt Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates from becoming an "Acquiring
Person" in respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (as such term is defined in the Company Rights Agreement),
shall be irrevocable and unconditional and no Company Change of Recommendation
or other action shall change such approval or action.

or who is (i) a senior-level employee or officer (i.e., a managing director
(or similar title) or more senior) of any financial advisor or investment bank

issuance and reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and
the conversion of Company Stock Options into options with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock, and the conversion of the Company RSUs into shares of

reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 



 

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or dissemination to
stockholders of, the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement and, except as

communication from the SEC or any state securities commission and will use
reasonable best efforts to promptly respond to any such request or comments by
the SEC (subject to this _Section 6.6(b)_).

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the respective stockholders
of Parent and/or the Company, as applicable (subject to _Section 6.6(b)_).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall take all actions necessary in
accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, in
the case of the Company, and the Parent Organizational Documents, in the case
of Parent, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, respectively, to be held as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, to consider, in the
case of Parent, the Stock Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment (the "
_Parent Stockholders  Meeting_") and, in the case of the Company, the
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). The
Company will, except in the case of a Company Change of Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 6.4(e)_ or _Section 6.4(f)_, use reasonable best
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or
applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Parent will, except in the case of a
Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.5(e)_ or
_Section 6.5(f)_, use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the Stock Issuance and the Parent Charter
Amendment and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or
applicable Law to obtain such approval. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_, the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders for adoption at the Company Stockholders
Meeting even if a Company Change of Recommendation shall have occurred and
Parent shall submit the approval of the Stock Issuance and the Parent Charter
Amendment to its stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting even if a
Parent Change of Recommendation shall have occurred.

 



 

(e) Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, on the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement but subject to the DGCL, the Companys obligation to give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parents obligation to
give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting, shall not
be limited, or otherwise affected, by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of a Company Change of Recommendation
or Parent Change of Recommendation, and neither the Company nor Parent shall
change the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent
Stockholders Meeting, respectively, or postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, without
the prior written consent of the other party. In addition, without the prior
written consent of the other party, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
an advisory vote on compensation payable to executive officers of the Company
in connection with the Merger shall be the only proposals to be voted on at
the Company Stockholders Meeting, and the approval of the Stock Issuance and
the adoption of the Parent Charter Amendment shall be the only proposals to be
voted on at the Parent Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either the Company or Parent may, and Parent or the Company may require the
other party to, adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
or Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, an aggregate of one time (for a
period of not more than 30 calendar days but not past two Business Days prior
to the End Date), if prior to such adjournment, delay or postponement the
Company or Parent, respectively, shall not have received an aggregate number
of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement or for the Stock
Issuance, respectively, which have not been withdrawn, such that the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval, respectively,
shall be obtained. Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon the reasonable
request of the other party, provide information to such other party regarding
the aggregate vote tally of the proxies received with respect to the Company
Stockholder Approval and Parent Stockholder Approval, respectively.

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter), Parent shall, as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards; Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the
Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
vest and be converted into an option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ "), on the
same terms and conditions (except as provided in this _Section 6.7(a)(i)_) as
were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; _provided_ ,
_however_ , there shall be no acceleration of the vesting of Company Stock
Options granted in 2012 and all such Company Stock Options, upon conversion
into Parent Stock Options, shall remain subject to the vesting conditions as
were applicable to such Company Stock Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The per-share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Parent Stock Options will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which the Company Stock Options were exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
resulting per-share exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

 



 

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, (A) each award of restricted share
units with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock
Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ") (other than any Company RSUs granted in
2012) shall, as of the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or free of
conditions to payment, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted, into the right to receive from Parent, at the
Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the holder) equal
to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such grant of Company RSUs (in the case of any award subject to
performance vesting, at the target level of performance applicable to such
award) and (y) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent that a holder of a Company RSU has made a valid deferral
election with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

such Company RSU, the settlement of such Company RSU shall be governed by the
terms of such deferral election, and (B) all Company RSUs granted in 2012 that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a number of Parent RSUs equal to the product of (x)
the number of Company RSUs held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number, and remain outstanding on the same terms and conditions as are
applicable to such awards prior to the Effective Time, with the performance
targets applicable thereto equitably adjusted by the Companys Board of
Directors or a Committee thereof before the Effective Time as appropriate (and
in a manner consistent with that outlined in Section 6.7(a)(ii)(B) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) to reflect relevant performance targets.

 



 

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass such resolutions or
take such other actions as required to effect the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.7(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans and Parent Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, _provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent from amending or
terminating any such Company Benefit Plans, Parent Benefit Plans, arrangements
or agreements in accordance with their terms or from terminating the
employment of any Company Employee or any Parent Employees to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Benefit Plans and the
Parent Benefit Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement and at the
Effective Time shall remain in effect with respect to employees and former
employees of the Company or Parent and their Subsidiaries (the " _Newco
Employees_ "), respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time,
until such time as Parent shall otherwise determine, subject to applicable Law
and the terms of such plans. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time and consistent with any obligations arising under any collective
bargaining agreement or similar contract, the Company and Parent shall take
all actions necessary to transition the Company Employees participation in
the Company Benefit Plans to the Parent Benefit Plans, and, at the effective
time of such transition, such Company Employees shall cease to accrue any
additional benefits under the applicable Company Benefit Plans. It is the
intention of Parent and the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, to (x) complete such transition to Parent Benefit Plans on a comparable
basis in respect of Company Employees and Parent Employees as soon as
administratively practicable after the Effective Time, and (y) provide to
similarly situated Company Employees and Parent Employees following the
Effective Time base salaries and wage rates and cash bonus opportunities on a
comparable basis, in the case of both clauses (x) and (y) taking into account
all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.7(b)(ii)_, except as otherwise provided under any

 



      
 

 



 

collective bargaining agreement or similar contract, Parent shall provide each
Company Employee during the 12-month period beginning on the Closing Date with
cash severance benefits in an amount, and otherwise on terms, no less
favorable than the amount and terms in effect immediately before the Effective
Time under the Company severance plan in which the Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plans or new Benefit Plan in which
any Company Employees first become eligible to participate at or after the
Effective Time, (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall: (A) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any New Plans that are health benefit plans in which such employees may
be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan; (B) in the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs, provide each Company Employee and their eligible dependents with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time; and (C) recognize all service of the Company Employees with
the Company and its Affiliates, for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with respect to defined
benefit pension plans, benefit accrual in any New Plan in which such employees
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, including any
severance plan, to the extent such service is taken into account under the
applicable New Plan and to the extent such service was granted under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits or apply to equity-
based plans unless such service credit is applicable to employees of Parent.
On and after the Effective Time, the Company shall continue in full force and
effect pursuant to their terms all agreements set forth in _Section
4.15(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any similar agreements
entered into consistent with _Section 6.1_, as such agreements may be amended
from time to time in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(iv) Parent shall make payments to individuals who are participants in the
Companys 2012 annual cash incentive program in such amounts as are determined
for such individual by the Company on or before the Effective Date (to the
extent such payments have not yet been made), with such payments to be made as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than
March 15, 2013); provided, however, that any such participant who terminated
employment before such payment is made shall instead receive payment pursuant
to the annual incentive-related provisions of such participants respective
severance arrangements.

 



 

(v) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.7_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Newco Employee
(or any other current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor) any right to continued employment for any period or continued
receipt of any specific benefit or

 



      
 

 



 

compensation, or shall constitute the establishment of or amendment to or any
other modification of any New Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit
Plan or shall limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
modify or terminate any New Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan.
Further, this _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to
the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
6.7_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
(including any Newco Employee) any rights or remedies of any nature (including
any third-party beneficiary rights under this Agreement) whatsoever under or
by reason of this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Regulatory Approvals; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its

done, promptly and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including: (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions,

an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party (including any Governmental Entity) for any
consent or approval required under any contract or agreement for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than
customary filing fees required in connection with any registration or filings
referred to in clause (i) above; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to accept or agree
to, and, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither the
Company nor Parent shall accept or agree to or allow any of their respective
Subsidiaries to accept or agree to, any Order in connection with any Requisite
Regulatory Approval that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
constitute, cause or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, file (1) an application to the FERC for the FERC
Approval, (2) an application to the NYPSC for approval under the PSL or a
determination that no such approval is required, and application to NYPSC for
an increase to the appropriate debt authorization limits pursuant to PSL §69,
(3) an application to the PUCT for approval or a determination that no such
approval is required, (4) a notice to the CPUC, and (5) an application to the
NRC for a threshold determination that the transaction does not constitute a
change of control of the rules and regulations of the NRC, and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) as promptly as practicable after the date of the filing of an application
to the FERC for FERC Approval (and in any event within ten Business Days after
such date), make their respective filings and thereafter make any other
required submissions under the HSR Act. In addition, the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any other filings are required to be made with, or other
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be
obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such other filings
and timely seeking all such other consents, permits, authorizations or

of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such

prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _8.1(c)_ so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
_Section 6.8_.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Takeover Law_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any action taken
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, so long
as this Agreement is in effect, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon (and reasonably consider such
comments), any press release or any public announcement primarily relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company
agree to issue a mutually acceptable initial joint press release announcing
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or

 



      
 

 



 

employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other
organization documents or in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any of its Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in
any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors, officers or employees in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly
and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this _Section 6.11_ without limit as to time.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each individual who
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such
individuals heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "),
in each case against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by Delaware law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such individual is not entitled to indemnification),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions in connection with such individuals serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request
or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such Action.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) purchase "tail" directors and officers liability
and fiduciary liability insurance policies which will provide coverage for a
period of six years after the Effective Time for the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

current and former directors and officers on substantially the same terms and
conditions as the policies currently maintained by the Company, including any
existing directors and officers liability or fiduciary liability run off
programs, for claims arising out of acts or conduct occurring on or before the
Effective Time and effective for claims asserted prior to or during the six-
year period referred to above (and, with respect to claims made prior to or
during such period, until final resolution thereof); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation expend
for any year of such six-year period an amount in excess of 300% of the annual
aggregate premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance policies
(the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at
all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum
Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
will cause to be maintained the most advantageous policies of directors and
officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium

 



 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable out of pocket expenses, including
reasonable out of pocket attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume or succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partys
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be
borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of

have been declared effective by the SEC) and signed by an officer of the
Company, containing representations of the Company, in each case
(notwithstanding _Sections 4.27_ and _5.27_ ) as shall be reasonably necessary
or appropriate to enable the Companys Counsel to render the opinion described

Section 6.19 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) As part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall, if requested by Parent, commence a "change of control" tender
offer (the " _Change in Control Offers_ ") for each series of the outstanding
Notes pursuant to the terms of the Notes prior to, but conditioned on, the
Closing, and (ii) Parent may, at its election following consultation with the
Company, commence a tender offer for cash or an exchange offer for securities
for all or any portion of the outstanding Notes prior to, but conditioned on,
the Closing (the " _Parent Debt Offers_ " and, together with the Change in
Control Offers, the " _Debt Offers_ "), in each case in compliance with
applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with the
Debt Offers; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as set forth in _Section
6.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the terms, conditions, timing and
all other decisions regarding the Debt Offers shall be determined by Parent in
its sole discretion. As part of any Debt Offer, Parent may elect to include a
Consent Solicitation to alter the terms of any remaining Notes outstanding
after giving effect to the Debt Offer _provided_ , that any such altered terms
shall become operative only upon Closing and the acceptance of the offer and
payment for the Notes tendered pursuant thereto.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Parties determine to make a Debt Offer, Parent or its
Representatives shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with such Debt Offer, including the offer to purchase, any related
letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the " _Debt
Offering Documents_ "). Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other
in the preparation of the Debt Offering Documents. The Debt Offering Documents
and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt
Offers shall be subject to the prior review and comment by each of the Company
and Parent and/or their Representatives, subject to the terms and conditions
of _Section 6.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and shall be reasonably
acceptable to each of them. The closing of the Debt Offers shall be subject to
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.19(e)_; _provided_ , that the
consummation of the Debt Offers will not be a condition to the Closing. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in connection with the Debt
Offers in order to cause the consent date under the Consent Solicitation to
occur as directed by Parent concurrently with the Closing and the initial
settlement of the Debt Offers to occur concurrently with the Closing. Subject
to _Section 6.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall waive
any of the conditions to the Change in Control Offers (other than that the
Merger shall have occurred or that Parent and the Company shall be satisfied
that it shall occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Change
in Control Offers, the Requested Consents shall have been received, and

 



      
 

 



 

that there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the
Change in Control Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and so long
as such waivers would not cause the Change in Control Offers to violate the
Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act, or any other Law and shall not, without
the consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Change in Control Offer or
make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Change in Control Offer
other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company need not make any change to the
terms and conditions of the Change in Control Offers requested by Parent that
deceases the price per Note payable in the Change in Control Offers or imposes
conditions to the Change in Control Offers in addition to those set forth in
_Section 6.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are materially adverse
to holders of the Notes, unless such change is approved in advance by the
Company in writing. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Debt Offering Documents
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the respective holders of Notes
(subject to this _Section 6.19(b)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.19(b)_, the Company shall comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent
such Law is applicable in connection with any Change in Control Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this _Section
6.19(b)_, the Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by such compliance.

 



 

(c) Promptly upon the receipt of the Requested Consents, the Company shall
enter into a supplemental indenture reflecting the amendments to the
applicable Indenture approved by such Requested Consents and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee of the applicable Indentures to
promptly enter into such supplemental indenture; _provided_ , that the
amendments contained in such supplemental indenture shall become operative
only upon the Closing and the acceptance of the offer and payment for the
Notes tendered pursuant thereto. Concurrently with the Closing, pursuant to
Parents written instructions, the Company shall use Available Funds, together
with the proceeds of the Financing Commitment (to the extent necessary), to
consummate the Change in Control Offers and Consent Solicitations (including
the payment of all applicable premiums, consent fees and all related fees and
expenses). The Company shall accept for purchase and use such funds to
purchase the Notes tendered in the Change in Control Offers and pay such
applicable premiums, consent fees and other related fees and expenses.

 



 

(d) In connection with the Change in Control Offers, the Company shall enter
into one or more dealer-manager, information agent and/or depositary
agreements with such Persons of national reputation in the provision of such
services as Parent shall reasonably request, after consultation with the
Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Parent
shall be solely responsible for any payment obligation to any dealer-manager,
information agent, depositary or other agent or Person with respect to fees
and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses under any agreement referred to in the preceding sentence and agrees
to become a party to any such agreement for purposes of such obligations and
that any such agreement may expressly provide that Parent shall be solely
responsible for such payments.

 



 

(e) The Companys and the Surviving Corporations obligation to accept for
payment and pay for the Notes tendered pursuant to each Change in Control
Offer or make any payment for the Requested Consents shall be subject to the
conditions that (i) the Merger shall have occurred (or Parent and the Company
shall each be satisfied that the Closing will occur substantially concurrently
with such acceptance and payment and/or exchange), (ii) the Requested Consents
shall have been received, (iii) there shall be no Order prohibiting the
consummation of the Change in Control Offer and (iv) such other conditions as
are customary for transactions similar to the Debt Offers. Parents obligation
to accept and to exchange the Notes tendered pursuant to the Parent Debt Offer
shall be subject to the conditions that (i) the Merger shall have occurred (or
Parent and the Company shall each be satisfied that the Closing will occur
substantially concurrently with such acceptance and payment and/or exchange),
(ii) there shall be no Order prohibiting the consummation of the Parent Debt
Offer and (iii) such other conditions as are customary for transactions
similar to the Debt Offers.

 



 

(f) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ (other than a
termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_, _Section 8.1(h)_ or
_Section 8.1(m)_, or by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_, but
without limitation of Parents payment obligations under _Section 6.19(d)_),
then Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any previously
unreimbursed, documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 6.19_. If the Effective Time does not occur, Parent and Merger
Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors, any
dealer-manager and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act, for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with any
Debt Offer, the Debt Offering Documents or any other actions taken by them in
accordance with this _Section 6.19_; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless
any such Person to the extent that any such liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred arises from disclosure regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
disclosures incorporated by reference in the Debt Offering Documents) that is
finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
contained a material misstatement or omission.

 



 

(g) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to negotiate a payoff
letter, in advance of the Closing, from the agent under that certain Credit
Agreement by and among RRI Energy, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
administrative agent, the lenders from time to time party thereto and, GenOn
Americas, Inc., dated at September 20, 2010 (the " _Company Credit Facility_
"). The Company shall, and cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) terminate on the
Closing Date the Company Credit Facility and all related loan documents to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (ii) cause to be
released contemporaneously with the termination of the Company Credit
Facility, all Liens on the Companys assets and the assets of the Companys
Subsidiaries relating to the Company Credit Facility.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.20 _Debt Offer Financing; Alternative Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, to the extent the funds available under the Financing
Commitment are necessary to consummate the Debt Offers or Change in Control
Put Offers, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the Financing with respect to the Debt Offers and/or Notes
Put Offers, as the case may be, on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitment (provided that, for clarity, Parent may replace or amend
the Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the original
Financing Commitment, or otherwise replace or amend the Financing Commitment
so long as the terms would not adversely impact the ability of Parent to
timely consummate the Debt Offers and/or the Notes Put Offers, as the case may
be), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitment for the commitment period set forth therein, (ii)
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitment
(except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement), and (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions in such Financing Commitment applicable to Parent
that are within their control. In the event that all conditions to the
Financing Commitment have been satisfied in Parents good faith judgment, to
the extent necessary for the consummation of the Debt Offers and/or Notes Put
Offers, as the case may be, Parent shall draw upon the Financing contemplated
by the Financing Commitment; provided that the amount of such funding may be
reduced by the amount of Available Funds, if any. If any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Financing Commitment, Parent shall, to the extent necessary, use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms no less favorable in any material respect in the
aggregate to Parent as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event but no later than the Closing Date. Parent shall promptly provide
the Company with execution copies of all documentation relating to such
alternative financing and any references in this Agreement to "Financing"
and/or "Financing Commitment" shall be deemed to include such alternative
financing upon the execution of any documentation relating thereto. Parent
shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach, default, or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitment of which Parent or Merger
Sub becomes aware or the termination of the Financing Commitment. Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to obtain the Financing and shall provide the Company with recent
copies and drafts of the documentation with respect to the Financing.

 



 

(b) Parent may pursue a refinancing of all or a portion of the Companys
existing Indebtedness (an " _Alternative Financing_ " ), provided that (x)(i)
the Company and its Subsidiaries would not be required to incur any
obligations in respect to such Alternative Financing prior to the Closing
(except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section 6.20_ or _Section 6.21_),
and (ii) such Alternative Financing would not delay consummation of the
Closing hereunder, and (y) the consummation of such Alternative Financing is
subject to the conditions that (i) the Merger shall have occurred (or Parent
and the Company shall each be satisfied that the Closing will occur
substantially concurrently with such consummation), (ii) there shall be no
Order prohibiting such consummation and (iii) such other conditions as are
customary for similar transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.21 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) In connection with the Financing and any Alternative Financing, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent, at Parents
sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Financing or any Alternative Financing (provided that the foregoing
shall not require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries), including:

 



 

(i) furnishing Parent and its sources of Financing or Alternative Financing as
promptly as practicable with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or the sources of the Financing or Alternative Financing in connection

registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act for a public
offering of the debt securities contemplated by the Alternative Financing,
assuming that such offering was consummated at the same time during the
Companys fiscal year as the offering of debt securities contemplated by the
Alternative Financing (other than consolidating and other financial
statements; _provided_ that customary data as to the total assets, revenue,
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of non-guarantor subsidiaries shall be provided),
all other data that would be necessary for the underwriter of such offering of
debt securities contemplated by the Alternative Financing to receive customary
"comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) from the Companys
independent accountants in connection with such offering of the debt
securities contemplated by the Alternative Financing, all data that would be
necessary to obtain or confirm a corporate rating for the Companys secured
and unsecured Indebtedness on a standalone basis, all data of the type that
has historically been required by the Companys lenders in connection with its
secured debt financings and reasonable and customary authorization letters to

equity and cash flows and (B) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the end of any fiscal year ended not less than ninety (90) days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, and the related audited statements of
income, equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes and
schedules thereto (the information described in _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_
being

 



      
 

 



 

referred to as the " _Required Information_ "), provided that the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to file the Required Information on a timely
basis pursuant to applicable Law;

 



 

(iii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary
one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for,
and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the financing and senior management
and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Financing or Alternative Financing, and providing reasonable cooperation in
obtaining corporate and facilities ratings at least twenty days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date to the extent required under the Financing or
Alternative Financing;

 



 

(iv) facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting and perfection
of security interests (including obtaining customary payoff letters, lien

Financing, including executing and delivering any customary collateral
documents and other customary documents and certificates as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, providing all documentation or other information required

responsibility of Parent and (y) requesting consents of accountants for use of
their reports in any materials relating to the Financing or Alternative
Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation letters),
private placement memoranda and similar documents required in connection with
the Financing or Alternative Financing;

 



 

(vi) facilitating the execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive
Financing or Alternative Financing documents by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and all other customary documents in connection therewith,

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters and
consents of independent accountants for the use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Financing or Alternative Financing) ( _provided_
that any

 



      
 

 



 

obligations contained in such documents shall be effective no earlier than as
of the Closing); and

 



 

(vii) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to satisfy the
conditions precedent to the Financing or Alternative Financing to the extent
within the control of the Company and causing the taking of corporate actions
by the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the
completion of the Financing or Alternative Financing.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with an electronic version of the
trademarks, service marks and corporate logo of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for use in marketing materials for the purpose of facilitating
the marketing of the Financing or Alternative Financing, and hereby consents
to the use of the foregoing in connection with the Financing or Alternative
Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended or is reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their marks or the reputation or goodwill of the Company.

 



 

(c) Neither of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
take any action that would subject it to actual or reasonably anticipated
liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other liability or provide
or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or
Alternative Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Closing Date unless
reimbursed or indemnified by Parent. Unless this Agreement has been terminated
by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(g), Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees and Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,

penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of

accordance with _Section 6.21(a)_ and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries)).

Alternative Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by

(the " _Company Expense Reimbursement_ "), and in no event shall the Company
be required to make any Company Expense Reimbursement if it has paid the
Company Termination Fee to Parent in full. The Company shall pay the Company
Expense Reimbursement to Parent in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the second Business Day following receipt from Parent of
request therefor accompanied by (to the extent practicable) documentation with
respect thereto.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated (or deemed to be terminated) by Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, then Parent shall pay to the
Company the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of outside legal counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts, consultants and other advisors, and the costs of
all filing fees and printing costs) incurred by the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether incurred before or after the date of this
Agreement, including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred in connection with its investigation, structuring, financing,
negotiation, due diligence, and financial, operating, legal and other analysis
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that the maximum aggregate amount of fees and expenses for which
Parent shall be required to reimburse the Company for under this _Section
8.3(d)_ shall not exceed $25,000,000 (except that the maximum aggregate amount
for such reimbursement shall not exceed $10,000,000 if and only if prior to
the termination (or deemed termination) of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_, no Parent Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and
no Third Party shall have publicly announced or communicated a _bona fide_
intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Parent Acquisition Proposal)
(the " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ "), and in no event shall Parent be

 



      
 

 



 

required to make any Parent Expense Reimbursement if it has paid the Parent
Termination Fee to the Company in full. Parent shall pay the Parent Expense
Reimbursement to the Company in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds on the second Business Day following receipt from the Company of request
therefor accompanied by (to the extent practicable) documentation with respect
thereto.

 



 

(e) Subject to the parties right to specifically enforce the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ ___9.5(a)_ prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement, but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub agree that (i) Parents right to receive
the payment of the Company Termination Fee (and, if applicable, the Company
Expense Reimbursement), as and when set forth in _Section_ ___8.3(a)_ (and, if
applicable, _Section_ ___8.3(c)_ ), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any of their respective former, current or future Representatives,
stockholders, general or limited partners, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents, assignees or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Company_ ___Related_ ___Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated or for any other breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and (ii) none of the Company Related Parties shall
have any liability or obligation, in any such case ( _clause_ ___(i)_ or
_(ii)_ ) relating to, arising out of or with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether relating to, arising out of
or with respect to any matter(s) forming the basis for such termination or
otherwise). Without limitation of the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any proceeding, claim, suit or action against, or seek
damages from, any of the Company Related Parties in contravention of the
preceding sentence. Under no circumstances shall the Company Termination Fee
be payable by the Company more than once.

 



 

(f) Subject to the parties right to specifically enforce the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_ prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement, but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company agrees that (i) its right to receive the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee (and, if applicable, the Parent Expense Reimbursement),
as and when set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ (and if applicable, _Section
8.3(d)_), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against
Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future Representatives, stockholders, general or limited partners,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, assignees or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for any other breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and (ii) none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any liability or obligation, in any such case ( _clause
(i)_ or _(ii)_ ) relating to, arising out of or with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether relating to,
arising out of or with respect to any matter(s) forming the basis for such
termination or otherwise). Without limitation of the foregoing, none of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any proceeding, claim,
suit or action against, or seek damages from, any of the Parent Related
Parties in contravention of the preceding sentence. Under no circumstances
shall the Parent Termination Fee be payable by Parent more than once.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as the
case may be, is not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, in the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee, as the case may be, is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. If either the Company or Parent fails to
pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may
be, the Company Expense Reimbursement or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as
applicable when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the defaulting party for
such Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee, Company Expense
Reimbursement or Parent Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, the
defaulting party shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as the case may be, the
Company Expense Reimbursement or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as the case
may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

 



 

(h) In the event the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall fail to be consummated or there shall be any breach or
failure to perform by Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, neither the Company nor
any of its Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed an Affiliate of the
Company for purposes of this _Section 8.3(h)_) shall have any rights or
claims against any Lender Party, its Affiliates or any of their respective
directors, officers, managers, employees, advisors or agents in connection
with the Financing Commitment or this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 9.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Merger, except for covenants and agreements
which contemplate performance after the Effective Time or otherwise expressly
by their terms survive the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring or
required to incur such expenses, except that the HSR Act filing fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing fees) shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.3 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by
telecopy or otherwise) to the other parties.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were
threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, and in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary
damages, each of the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
The parties further agree that no party to this Agreement shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.5(a)_
and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument. In addition, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 9.5(a)_, (ii) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment

 



       
 

 



 

or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that (x) service of all
process, including the summons and complaints, in any action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement may be made by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, to such party at its address set forth in _Section
9.7_, and (y) any service pursuant to _clause (x)_ is sufficient to confer
personal jurisdiction over such party in such action or proceeding and
otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every respect.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Lender Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitment or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law jurisdiction is vested in
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (or appellate courts thereof).

 



 

Section 9.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Notices_. Any notice required to be given hereunder shall be
sufficient if in writing, and sent by facsimile transmission ( _provided_ that
any notice received by facsimile transmission or otherwise at the addressees
location on any non-Business Day or any Business Day after 5:00 p.m.

or to such other address as any party shall specify by written notice so
given, and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date
so telecommunicated or personally delivered. Any party to this Agreement may
notify any other party of any changes to the address or any of the other
details specified in this paragraph; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice or
five Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection or
other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of changed address
of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be receipt of the notice as of

Section 9.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
for assignments by Merger Sub to a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary
of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is

 



      
 

 



 

so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and
schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. Subject to _Section 9.13(b)_, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended
(by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, in the
case of the Company or Merger Sub) or waived, in each case whether before or
after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and/or the Parent
Stockholder Approval, if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further
approval of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such
amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of
the Company; and _provided_ , _further_ , that after receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further
approval of the stockholders of Parent, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 9.13(b)_ below or, after the Effective
Time, for _Sections 3.1_ , _6.7(a)_ and _6.11_ , each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agrees that (i) their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and (ii) this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein.

and shall be entitled to enforce the agreements contained in, _Section
8.3(h)_, _Section 9.5(b)_, _Section 9.6_ and this _Section 9.13(b)_.
Without the prior written consent of the Lender Parties, none of the sections
referred to in the preceding sentence may be amended, modified, waived or

 



      
 

 



 

terminated in a manner that is materially adverse in any respect to any Lender
Party, its Affiliates or their respective directors, officers, managers,
employees, advisors or agents.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Construction_. Each of the parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first above written.

 **EXHIBIT B**

 



 

 **FORM OF AMENDED AND RESTATED**

 

 **BY-LAWS**

 

 **OF**

 

 **NRG ENERGY, INC.**

 



 

 _A Delaware Corporation_ 
(Adopted as of December 5, 2003, and Amended as of August 4, 2004, 
February 25, 2005, February 26, 2008, October 15, 2009 and [ ])

 



 

 _ARTICLE I_

 

 _OFFICES_

 



 

 _Section 1._ _Registered Office_. The registered office of NRG Energy, Inc.
(the " _Corporation_ ") in the State of Delaware shall be located at 1209
Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. The name of the Corporations registered
agent at such address shall be The Corporation Trust Company. The registered
office and/or registered agent of the Corporation may be changed from time to
time by action of the Board of Directors.

 



 

 _Section 2._ _Other Offices_. The Corporation may also have offices at such
other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation
may require.

 



 

 _ARTICLE II_

 

 _MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

 



 

 _Section 1._ _Annual Meeting_. An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be
held at such date and time specified by the Board of Directors for the purpose
of electing Directors and conducting such other proper business as may come
before the annual meeting. At the annual meeting, stockholders shall elect
Directors and transact such other business as properly may be brought before
the annual meeting pursuant to _Section 11_ of ARTICLE II hereof.

 



 

 _Section 2._ _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders may
only be called in the manner provided in the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation.

 



 

 _Section 3._ _Place of Meetings_. The Board of Directors may designate any
place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the place of meeting
for any annual meeting or for any special meeting. If no designation is made,
or if a special meeting be otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the
principal executive office of the Corporation. If for any reason any annual
meeting shall not be held during any year, the business thereof may be
transacted at any special meeting of the stockholders.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 4._ _Notice_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to
take action at a meeting, written or printed notice stating the place, date,
time and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes, of such
meeting, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote on the record
date, determined in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3_ of ARTICLE
VI. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his,
her or its address as the same appears on the records of the Corporation. An
affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent
of the Corporation that the notice required by this _Section 4_ has been given
shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein. Whenever the giving of any notice to stockholders is required by
applicable law, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these
By-laws, a waiver thereof, given by the person entitled to said notice,
whether before or after the event as to which such notice is required, shall
be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any waiver
of notice unless so required by applicable law, the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws.

 



 

 _Section 5._ _Stockholders List_. The officer having charge of the stock
ledger of the Corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of
the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
the stockholders agent or attorney, at the stockholders expense, for any
purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the
meeting, (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal
place of business of the Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept
at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. Except as provided by applicable
law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the
stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or
the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting
of stockholders.

 



 

 _Section 6._ _Quorum_. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by the Delaware General
Corporation Law or by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to vote at the
meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place. When a
specified item of business requires a vote by the holders of a class or series
of shares of capital stock (if the Corporation shall then have outstanding
shares of more than one class or series) voting as a class or series, the
holders of a majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a
quorum (as to such class or series) for the transaction of such item of
business, except as otherwise provided by the Delaware General Corporation Law
or by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 7._ _Adjourned Meetings_. When a meeting is adjourned to another
time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 



 

 _Section 8._ _Vote Required_. When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote
of the majority in voting power of shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the
act of the stockholders, unless (i) by express provisions of an applicable
law, the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the
Corporation, or of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question, or (ii) the subject matter is the
election of Directors, in which case ARTICLES SIX and TEN of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall govern and control the approval of
such subject matter.

 



 

 _Section 9._ _Voting Rights_. Except as otherwise provided by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or these By-laws, every stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one
vote in person or by proxy for each share of capital stock held by such
stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question.

 



 

 _Section 10._ _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the Corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended when the person
executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders and elects to
vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the fact of
the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named in the proxy
shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy,
notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy. At each
meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies
filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the
secretary or a person designated by the secretary, and no shares may be
represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or
irregular.

 



 

 _Section 11._ _Business Brought Before a Meeting of the Stockholders_.

 



 

(A) _Annual Meetings_.

 



 

(1) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors shall be considered and such business
shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To

properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations and other business must
be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by
or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) brought before the meeting
by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) otherwise properly
brought before the meeting by a stockholder who (i) is a stockholder of record
of the Corporation (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different,
on whose behalf such business is proposed or such nomination or nominations
are made, only if such beneficial owner is the beneficial owner of shares of
the Corporation) both at the time the notice provided for in paragraph (A) of
this _Section 11_ is delivered to the secretary of the Corporation and on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the
annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and
(iii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (A) of this
_Section 11_. For nominations or other business to be properly brought before
an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely
notice thereof in writing and in proper form to the secretary of the
Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not
later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than
the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the
first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting (provided, however,
that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30)
days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice
by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business
on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not
later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day
prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the
Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any
time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, in the event that
the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual
meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation
naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred
(100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting, a stockholders notice required by paragraph (A) of this _Section 11_
shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the Corporation.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary, only such
persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in
paragraph (A) of this _Section 11_ shall be eligible to be elected at an
annual meeting to serve as directors and no business shall be conducted at an
annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 11_. The presiding officer of an annual meeting shall, if the facts
warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not
properly made or any business was not properly brought before the meeting, as
the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 11_ ; if
he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and
any such nomination not properly made or any business not properly brought

meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporations notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that
directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the
Corporation who (a) is a stockholder of

 



      
 

 



 

record of the Corporation (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if
different, on whose behalf such nomination or nominations are made, only if
such beneficial owner is the beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation)
both at the time the notice provided for in paragraph (B) of this _Section 11_
is delivered to the Corporations secretary and on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, (b) is
entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election, and (c) complies with
the notice procedures set forth in the third sentence of paragraph (B) of this
_Section 11_. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of
stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of
Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors
may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such
position(s) as specified in the Corporations notice of meeting, if the
stockholders notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this _Section 11_ shall
be delivered to the Corporations secretary at the principal executive offices
of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred
twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the

special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the

no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

 



 

(C) _General_.

 



 

(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Section 11_ shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and
only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall
have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Section 11_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 11_ , if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the
stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall
be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
the Corporation.

 



 

(2) For purposes of this section, " _public announcement_ " shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by Dow Jones News Service, Associated
Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by
the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 11_ , a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this _Section 11_.

 



 

(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to (a) affect any rights of
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, (b) confer upon any
stockholder a right to have a nominee or any proposed business included in the
Corporations proxy statement, or (c) affect

 



      
 

 



 

any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors
pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation.

 



 

 _Section 12._ _Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Election at Meetings of
Stockholders_. The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting of
stockholders, may, and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or
more inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the
meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector
who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting,
the person presiding at the meeting may, and shall if required by applicable
law, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector,
before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign
an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality
and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall (a)
ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (b)
determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies
and ballots, (c) count all votes and ballots, (d) determine and retain for a
reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any
determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify their determination of the
number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and
ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to
assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise
provided by the Board of Directors, the date and time of the opening and the
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
a meeting shall be determined by the person presiding at the meeting and shall
be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, or any revocation
thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the
closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise. In determining
the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of
stockholders, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. No person who is a candidate for office at an election may
serve as an inspector at such election.

 



 

 _Section 13._ _Conduct of Meetings; Organization_. The Board of Directors may
adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting
of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. The chairman of the board shall
preside at all meetings of the stockholders. If the chairman of the board is
not present at a meeting of the stockholders, the vice chairman shall preside
at such meeting. If neither the chairman nor the vice chairman of the board is
present at a meeting of the stockholders, the chief executive officer or the
president (if the president is a Director and is not also the chairman of the
board) shall preside at such meeting, and, if the chief executive officer or
the president is not present at such meeting, a majority of the Directors
present at such meeting shall elect one of their members to so preside. Except
to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the
Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders
shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to
prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as,
in the judgment of such person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the
meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board
of Directors or prescribed by the presiding officer of the meeting, may
include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda
or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders
of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or
such other persons as the person presiding over the meeting shall determine;
(iv) restrictions on entry

 



      
 

 



 

to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The
presiding officer at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a
matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such
presiding officer should so determine, such person shall so declare to the
meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure. The secretary, or in his or her absence,
one of the assistant secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In
case none of the officers above designated to act as the person presiding over
the meeting or as secretary of the meeting, respectively, shall be present, a
person presiding over the meeting or a secretary of the meeting, as the case
may be, shall be designated by the Board of Directors, and in case the Board
of Directors has not so acted, in the case of the designation of a person to
act as secretary of the meeting, designated by the person presiding over the
meeting.

 



 

 _Section 14._ _Order of Business_. The order of business at all meetings of

of the business and affairs of the Corporation (including the power and
authority to designate other committees of the Board of Directors); provided,
however, that no such committee shall have power or authority in reference to
the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the
stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the General
Corporation law of the State of Delaware to be submitted to stockholders for
approval, or (ii) adopting, amending, or repealing any Bylaw of the
Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee. Such committee or committees shall
have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes
of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors upon request.
Each committee designated by the Board of Directors shall be formed and

regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or any national securities exchange
on which any securities of the Corporation are listed and these By-laws, each

shall hold its meetings as provided by such rules, except as may otherwise be
provided by a resolution of the Board of Directors designating such committee.
Unless otherwise provided in such a resolution, the presence of at least a
majority of the members of the committee shall be necessary to constitute a
quorum. Unless otherwise provided in such a resolution, in the event that a
member and that members alternate, if alternates are designated by the Board
of Directors, of such committee is or are absent or disqualified, the member
or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in
place of any such absent or disqualified member.

 



 

 _Section 11._ _Communications Equipment_. Members of the Board of Directors
or any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting of such
board or committee through the use of a conference telephone or other
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear and speak with each other, and participation in the meeting
pursuant to this section shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

 



 

 _Section 12._ _Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Assent_. Any member of
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting
shall be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting except
when such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning
of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to
have assented to any action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered
in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such
action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the
secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting.
Such right to dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in favor of such
action.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 13._ _Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any
action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of
Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all
members of such board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in
writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings
of the board or committee.

 _ARTICLE V_

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

 _Section 1._ _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved
(including involvement as a witness) in

 



      
 

 



 

any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a Director or officer of the Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Corporation or, while a Director, officer or employee of the Corporation
or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation as
a director, officer, employee, partner, member, manager, trustee, fiduciary or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other entity or enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_ "), shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid
in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, partner,
member, manager, trustee, fiduciary or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,
except as provided in _Section 2_ of this ARTICLE V with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or advance of expenses, the
Corporation shall not indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee except to the extent
such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in writing by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this
_Section 1_ of this ARTICLE V shall be a contract right and shall include the
obligation of the Corporation to pay the expenses incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an " _advance of
expenses_ "); provided, however, that an advance of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an " _undertaking_ "), by
or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this _Section 1_ of
this ARTICLE V or otherwise. For purposes of this ARTICLE V, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation shall be deemed to include any subsidiary for
which nominal equity interests have been issued to persons other than the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the laws of such
subsidiarys jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

 



 

 _Section 2._ _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any indemnification of an
indemnitee or advance of expenses under _Section 1_ of this ARTICLE V shall
be made promptly, and in any event within thirty days (or, in the case of an
advance of expenses, twenty days), upon the written request of the indemnitee.
If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advance of
expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request
is not made within thirty days (or, in the case of an advance of expenses,
twenty days), the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this
ARTICLE V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification or advance of
expenses, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by
the Corporation.

 



 

 _Section 3._ _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a
Director, officer, employee or agent of

 



      
 

 



 

the Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation or was serving
at the request of the Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Corporation as a Director, officer, employee, partner, member, manager,
trustee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company, trust or other entity or enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expenses, liability
or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



 

 _Section 4._ _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this ARTICLE V shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any indemnitee in respect of any act, omission or
condition existing or event or circumstance occurring prior to the time of
such repeal or modification.

 



 

 _Section 5._ _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and
to the advance of expenses conferred in this ARTICLE V and in the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire hereunder or under any
statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or
otherwise.

 



 

 _Section 6._ _Other Sources_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify or to advance expenses to any Director, officer or employee who was
or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another entity shall be reduced by any amount such Director, officer or
employee may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such
other entity.

 



 

 _Section 7._ _Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses_. This
ARTICLE V shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in
the manner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and to advance expenses
to persons other than Directors or officers (including employees and agents)
with the same or lesser scope and effect as provided herein when and as
authorized by appropriate corporate action.

 



 

 _Section 8._ _Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this ARTICLE V,
references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the corporation
resulting from or surviving a consolidation or merger with the Corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger with the Corporation which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its Directors, officers or employees, so that any person who is or
was a Director or officer of such constituent corporation or a wholly owned
subsidiary of such constituent corporation or, while a Director, officer or
employee of such constituent corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of such
constituent corporation is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of such constituent corporation as a
director, officer, employee, partner, member, manager, trustee, fiduciary or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other entity or enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan, shall stand in the same position under
this ARTICLE V with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or
she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9._ _Severability_. If any provision of this ARTICLE V shall be
found to be invalid or limited in application by reason of any law or
regulation, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions
hereof.

 



 

 _ARTICLE VI_

 

 _CERTIFICATES OF STOCK_

 



 

 _Section 1._ _General_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be
entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the Corporation
by the president or vice president and the secretary or an assistant secretary
of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in
the Corporation, provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation may
provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or
series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares (except that the foregoing
shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate
is surrendered to the Corporation). If a certificate is countersigned by a
transfer agent or a registrar, the required signatures may be facsimiles. In
case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose facsimile signature or
signatures have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease
to be such officer or officers of the Corporation whether because of death,
resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates have been
delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may
nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who
signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or
signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or
officers of the Corporation. All certificates for shares shall be
consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom
the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date
of issue, shall be entered on the books of the Corporation. Shares of stock of
the Corporation shall only be transferred on the books of the Corporation by
the holder of record thereof or by such holders attorney duly authorized in
writing, upon surrender to the Corporation of the certificate or certificates
for such shares endorsed by the appropriate person or persons, with such
evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement, transfer, authorization and
other matters as the Corporation may reasonably require, and accompanied by
all necessary stock transfer stamps. In that event, it shall be the duty of
the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate or certificates and record the transaction on its
books. Each such new certificate will be registered in such name as is
requested by the holder of the surrendered certificate and shall be
substantially identical in form to the surrendered certificate. Upon the
receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of
uncertificated shares, if any, such uncertificated shares shall be cancelled,
issuance of new equivalent uncertificated or certificated shares shall be made
to the stockholder entitled thereto and the transaction shall recorded upon
the books and records of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may appoint
one or more transfer agents or registrars or both in connection with the
transfer of any class or series of securities of the Corporation.

 



 

 _Section 2._ _Lost Certificates_. The Corporation may issue (i) a new
certificate or certificates of stock or (ii) uncertificated shares in place of
any certificate or certificates previously issued by the Corporation, as
applicable, in place of any certificate or certificates previously issued by
the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the

 



      
 

 



 

making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of
stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new
certificate or certificates, the Corporation may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal
representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate.

 



 

 _Section 3._ _Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings_. In order that
the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10
days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board
of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on
the next day preceding the day on which notice is first given. A determination
of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

 



 

 _Section 4._ _Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes_. In order that the
Corporation may determine: (i) the stockholders entitled to receive payment of
any dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights; or (ii) the
stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days nor less than 10
days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 



 

 _Section 5._ _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the Corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of
any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof.

 



 

 _Section 6._ _Subscriptions for Stock_. Unless otherwise provided for in any
subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at such
time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined by the
Board of Directors. Any call made by the Board of Directors for payment on
subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or as to all
shares of the same series. In case of default in the payment of any
installment or call when such payment is due, the Corporation may proceed to
collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the Corporation.

Director of the Corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment of
the Directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to
benefit the Corporation and would not violate applicable law. The loan,
guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest, and may be
unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve,
including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the Corporation,

 _Section 7._ _Voting Securities Owned By Corporation_. Voting securities in
any other company held by the Corporation shall be voted by the chief
executive officer, the president or a vice president, unless the Board of

authority may be general or confined to specific instances, upon some other
person or officer. Any person authorized to vote securities shall have the
power to appoint proxies, with general power of substitution.

have power from time to time to determine to what extent and at what times and

State of Delaware, unless and until authorized so to do by resolution of the
Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation.

 _Section 10._ _Inconsistent Provisions_. In the event that any provision of
these By-laws is or becomes inconsistent with any provision of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Delaware General Corporation Law,
the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, or any other applicable law or
