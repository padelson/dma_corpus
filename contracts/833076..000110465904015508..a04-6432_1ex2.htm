NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and promises herein

1.1 _Purchase of Interests_. At Closing (as defined below), unless
this Agreement is terminated under Article VIII, Thomas shall and shall
cause the Transferring Affiliates to sell, transfer, assign and deliver to
Genlyte, and Genlyte shall purchase, accept, assume and receive all right,
title and interest in and to the Purchased Interests, free and clear of any
liens, claims, charges, equitable interests or encumbrances (collectively,
**"Encumbrances"** ).

  



  

 **ARTICLE II 
  
 PURCHASE PRICE**

  



  

2.1 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased
Interests shall be the sum of (a) Three Hundred Eighty-Six Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($386,500,000) (the **"Fixed Purchase Price"**
); and (b) an amount equal to the Thomas Net Income (as defined below) less
the aggregate cash dividends and distributions (other than payments (i)
paid pursuant to Section 9.1(c) prior to the Closing Date and (ii) to

2.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, unless this Agreement
is terminated under Article VIII, Genlyte shall pay the Thomas Entities the
Fixed Purchase Price and an amount equal to the Estimated Thomas Net Income
(as defined below) less the Dividends (collectively, the **"Closing Date

good faith estimate of the Net Income (as defined below), which estimate
shall be delivered from Genlyte to Thomas at least three (3) business days
prior to Closing.

  



  

2.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment - Net Income_.

  



  

(a) Within thirty (30) days after the completion of the Closing, Genlyte
shall deliver to Thomas an income statement of GTG for the period commencing
January 1, 2004 and ending on the Closing Date (the **"Closing Date Income
Statement"** ) and the resulting calculation of the Thomas Net Income. In
connection therewith, from and after Closing, Genlyte and GTG shall provide
Thomas and its representatives with reasonable access to all records and work
papers necessary to compute and verify the Closing Date Income Statement.
 The Closing Date Income Statement as delivered to Thomas shall be final and
binding on the parties for purposes of determining the Thomas Net
Income unless, within thirty (30) days after delivery to Thomas, Thomas shall
deliver to Genlyte a Dispute Notice (as defined below).  After delivery of a
Dispute Notice, Genlyte and Thomas shall promptly negotiate in good faith
with respect to the subject of the Dispute Notice, and if they are unable to
reach an agreement within ten (10) business days after delivery to Genlyte of
the Dispute Notice, the dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor
(as defined below).  The Independent Auditor shall be directed to issue a
final and binding decision within thirty (30) days of submission of the
Dispute Notice, as to the issues of disagreement referred to in the Dispute
Notice and not resolved by the parties. The Closing Date Income Statement
and the resulting calculation of the Thomas Net Income, as so adjusted by
agreement or by the Independent Auditor (if required), shall be final and
binding on the parties. **"Thomas Net Income"** shall mean 32% of the **"Net
Income"** , which is defined to mean the aggregate (without duplication) net
income of GTG and GTG Intangible and their respective subsidiaries (to the
extent the financial results of such subsidiaries are included in GTGs and
GTG Intangibles consolidated financial statements for purposes of GAAP) for
the period commencing January 1, 2004 and ending on the Closing Date,
calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied and applied on a basis consistent with the financial
statements of GTG for fiscal year 2003 ( **"GAAP"** ); provided, however,
that (i) the following will not be deducted for purposes of calculating Net
Income (A) any dividends or distributions (other than payments to reimburse
Thomas for actual expenses (but not income taxes) paid by Thomas on behalf of
GTG) made by GTG or GTG Intangible to Genlyte or any of the Thomas Entities,
(B) any of the Purchase Price paid by GTG on behalf of Genlyte and (C) any
third party out of pocket expenses and costs incurred by GTG and
GTG Intangible to the extent directly arising out of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to, any costs
and expenses related to the financing or funding of the Purchase Price
and establishing a new working capital line of credit or amending the
existing working capital line of credit of GTG, in any event in order to fund
the Purchase Price and the working capital requirements of GTG after Closing
as contemplated pursuant to Section 6.3, (ii) Net Income will exclude
any amounts which have been or may hereafter be received in connection with
the Patent Litigation (as defined in Section 9.5); and (iii) Net Income
will not be reduced by any contingency reserves to the extent the reserves
are not appropriate under GAAP. Thus, by way of example, amounts of the
types labeled under "adjustments" or "contingency" on

  



  

2      
   



  

monthly flash reports shall be taken into account only to the extent the
reserve is appropriate under GAAP.

  



  

(b) In connection with the Closing Date Income Statement, a **"Dispute
Notice"** shall mean a written notice from Thomas indicating disagreement
with the Closing Date Income Statement and identifying and summarizing each
of the items in dispute.  The **"Independent Auditor"** shall mean a national
public accounting firm with no material relationship to the parties or their
respective affiliates chosen by agreement of the parties, or if they are
unable to agree, shall mean a national firm with no such relationship chosen
by lot. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor retained as a result
of any dispute related to the Closing Date Income Statement shall be split
equally between Genlyte and Thomas.

  



  

(c) If the Estimated Thomas Net Income is less than the Thomas Net Income,
Genlyte shall pay Thomas the difference within five (5) business days of the
final resolution of the calculation of Thomas Net Income as set forth in
Section 2.3(a).

  



  

(d) If the Thomas Net Income is less than the Estimated Thomas Net Income,
Thomas shall pay Genlyte the difference within five (5) business days of the
final resolution of the calculation of Thomas Net Income as set forth in
Section 2.3(a).

  



  

2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties agree that the Fixed Purchase
Price and the payment of the Thomas Net Income is paid in exchange for the
Purchased Interests held by Thomas and the Transferring Affiliates as defined
in Section 741 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
**"Code"** ).  The parties hereto shall file all federal, state and local tax
returns in a manner consistent with this Section 2.4.

  



  

 **ARTICLE III**

3.1 _Closing_. The purchase of the Purchased Interests contemplated by this
Agreement (the **"Closing"** ) shall, subject to the termination of this
Agreement under Article VIII, take place at a place to be mutually agreed

and/or GTG are not able to obtain directors and officers liability and
fiduciary liability protection on the terms described above, Genlyte and GTG

and their respective successors and assigns.

10      
   



  

directors or employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 9.4 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

company, corporation, cooperative, trust, estate or other entity.

  



  

9.5 _Patent Litigation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the consummation of the Closing and the provisions of
subsection (c) of this Section 9.5, the parties agree that the Thomas
Entities shall be entitled to 32% of any settlement amount or award (net of
any counterclaim or set off), including, but not limited to, any royalties or
future payments, actually and irrevocably received by GTG with respect to the
case in which _Genlyte Thomas Group L.L C,_ is plaintiff having been
assigned Case No. 3:02-CV-0602-K pending in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Texas (the **"Patent Litigation"** ) as a result
of a settlement or judgment entered into on or before the Closing Date, but
only to the extent such amount or award is not subject to any appeal, motion
or claim which could cause GTG to have to repay it.

  



  

(b) Subject to the consummation of the Closing and the provisions of
subsection (c) of this Section 9.5:

  



  

(i) If Thomas irrevocably elects in writing delivered to Genlyte and GTG
prior to Closing to continue to fund 32% of the legal fees and other expenses
and costs directly related to the Patent Litigation incurred by GTG after the
Closing Date (the **"Patent Expenses"** ), Thomas shall (A) be entitled to a
payment from GTG of 32% of any settlement amount or award, including, but not
limited to, any royalties or future payments (net of any counterclaim or set
off) actually and irrevocably received by GTG after the Closing Date with
respect to the Patent Litigation, but only to the extent such amount or award
is not subject to any appeal, motion or claim which could cause GTG to have
to repay it and (B) promptly pay GTG, upon receipt of invoices from GTG, 32%
of the Patent Expenses from time to time incurred by GTG; or

  



  

(ii) If Thomas does not irrevocably elect in writing delivered to Genlyte and
GTG prior to Closing to continue to fund 32% of the Patent Expenses, (A)
Thomas shall not be obligated to continue to fund the Patent Expenses and (B)
following the actual, complete and irrevocable receipt by GTG following the
Closing Date of funds from the final and complete settlement or award, Thomas
shall be entitled to a payment from GTG of the lesser of (1) 32% of the total
legal fees and other expenses and costs directly related to the Patent
Litigation incurred or accrued by GTG through but not after the Closing Date
(the **"Thomas Legal Fees"** ) or (2) an amount equal to the "Applicable
Fraction", as hereinafter defined, times the amount of the settlement amount
or award, including, but not limited to, the royalties and future payments
(net of any counterclaim or set off) actually and irrevocably received by GTG
after the Closing Date with respect to the Patent Litigation to the extent
such amount or award is not subject to any appeal, motion or claim which
could cause GTG to have to repay it.  The term **"Applicable Fraction"**
means a fraction determined by dividing (A) the Thomas Legal Fees by (B) the
aggregate legal fees and other expenses and costs directly related to the
Patent Litigation

  



  

11      
   



  

incurred or accrued by GTG, inclusive of all such amounts incurred or accrued
by GTG before, on and after the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
amounts deemed to be received by GTG under Sections 9.5(a) and 9.5(b) will be
reduced by and net of all reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred
by GTG in the collection or attempted collection of any amount past due or
which may become past due in connection with any settlement or award with
respect to the Patent Litigation and (ii) Thomas will not be entitled to
participate in or receive any portion of any royalties or future payments to
be paid with respect to products manufactured or sold after a settlement or
award in the Patent Litigation except as expressly provided in
the immediately following sentence. With respect to the amounts deemed to be
received by GTG with respect to Sections 9.5(a) and 9.5(b), if the Patent
Litigation is settled by agreement of the parties to the Patent Litigation
and the parties to such settlement expect that more than 33% of the net
present value (as determined by GTG in good faith) of all amounts and
consideration paid and payable to GTG pursuant to such settlement will be
paid in the form of future royalties or future payments to GTG on the 731
patent for products manufactured or sold by the named defendant in the Patent
Litigation or such defendants affiliates after the settlement (the **"Future
Royalties"** ), GTG will pay Thomas 32% of such Future Royalties (reduced by
all attorneys fees and other costs incurred by GTG in the collection or
attempted collection of any amount past due or which may become past due in
connection with any settlement or award with respect to the Future Royalties)
following GTGs actual and irrevocable receipt of such Future Royalties;
provided, however, that, with respect to Section 9.5(b)(ii), the amount to be
paid pursuant to this Section 9.5(c) shall not exceed the maximum amount set
forth in Section 9.5(b)(ii).

  



  

(d) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, the parties
agree to treat all amounts received by Thomas pursuant to this Section 9.5 as
taxable to Thomas and not GTG; provided, however, that in the event of a
claim by a taxing authority (a **"Tax Claim"** ) that such amounts
are taxable to GTG: (i) the parties shall utilize their reasonable best
efforts to resolve the Tax Claim in a manner consistent with intention of the
parties set forth in the beginning of this Section 9.5(d), (ii) Thomas shall
control all proceedings relating to the Tax Claim (and Thomas and GTG shall
share equally the third party costs and expenses relating to all proceedings
relating to the Tax Claim) but shall not resolve the Tax Claim without GTGs
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and (iii) to the
extent such amounts are ultimately determined to be taxable to GTG, Thomas
shall promptly pay GTG 50% of the excess of (a) the tax and penalties paid by
GTG (or its members) with respect to such amounts, over (b) the net present
value (based on GTGs cost of financing) of the future tax benefit GTG (and
its members) will receive with respect to the amortization for tax purposes
of such amounts. Provided, further, if the parties are unable to take, in
good faith and in compliance with Law, the tax positions contemplated in the
immediately preceding sentence or if Thomas shall fail to timely prosecute
such matter to a final decision, Thomas shall promptly pay GTG 50% of the
excess of (a) the tax and penalties paid by GTG (or its members) with respect
to such amounts, over (b) the net present value (based on GTGs cost of
financing) of the future tax benefit GTG (and its members) will receive with
respect to the amortization for tax purposes of such amounts.

  



  

9.6 _Environmental Matter_. The parties agree that neither GTG nor Genlyte
shall have any obligation to defend or indemnify any of the Thomas Entities
or any of their affiliates or any

  



  

12      
   



  

predecessors or successors of any of the Thomas Entities or any of their
affiliates with respect to the matter set forth in the letter dated March 9,
2004 from the State of Wisconsin, Department of Natural Resources, and the
property referenced therein (collectively, the **"Environmental Matter"** ).

  



  

9.7 _Canadian Withholding Tax_.  Genlyte and GTG agree that GTG shall not,
without the consent of Thomas, cause a distribution or dividend of cash to be
made, on or prior to the earlier of Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, from any of the Canadian entities which GTG, directly or
indirectly, owns or controls.

  



  

9.8 _Transition_. The Chief Executive Officers of Genlyte and Thomas will
work together in good faith to resolve any issues following Closing with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

9.9 _Thomas Stock Options_. All options to purchase common stock of Thomas
and all Stock Appreciation Rights relating to the common stock of Thomas held
by GTG employees who are employed by GTG as of the Closing Date will become
fully vested and exercisable on the consummation of the Closing and may be
exercised by but not after December 31, 2004.

  



  

9.10 _Capitalization Agreement_.  Subject to Sections 10.2(c) and 10.2(e),
the Capitalization Agreement among GTG and Thomas and certain of its
affiliates dated April 28, 1998 (the **"Capitalization Agreement"** ) will
continue in full force and effect following the Closing in accordance with
its terms.

  



  

9.11 _Cooperation and Efforts_.  Subject to the provisions of Article VI, VII
and VIII above, each party agrees to cooperate with each other and to
promptly take any and all actions required on their part, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, except as specifically
provided in this Agreement, Genlyte and GTG agree to operate GTG and to
conduct and operate the business and operations of GTG in the ordinary course
consistent with past practices through the Closing Date.

  



  

 **ARTICLE X 

**

  

 **SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

10.1 _Survival_. All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto shall be deemed to be material and
to have been relied upon by the parties hereto and shall survive the Closing
until fully performed. All representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall be
deemed to be material and to have been relied upon by the parties hereto, and
shall survive the Closing.

  



  

10.2 _Indemnification_. (a) Subject to the consummation of the Closing,

expenses for investigating and defending), suit, action, claim, deficiency,
liability or obligation (collectively, **"Loss"** ) related to, caused by or
arising from (i) any misrepresentation by Thomas,

  



  

13      
   



  

breach of warranty by Thomas or failure to fulfill any covenant or agreement
of any of the Thomas Entities contained herein or in any other instrument or
document delivered pursuant hereto by any or all of the Thomas Entities, (ii)
any matter subject to indemnification by any "Transferor" (as defined in the
Capitalization Agreement) under the Capitalization Agreement including
Section 8.2(a) thereof and (iii) the Environmental Matter.

  



  

(b) Subject to the consummation of the Closing, Genlyte shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Thomas and the Transferring Affiliates and their
respective affiliates from and against any and all Loss, related to, caused
by or arising from (i) any misrepresentation by Genlyte, breach of warranty
by Genlyte or failure by Genlyte or GTG to fulfill any covenant or agreement
contained herein or in any other agreement, instrument or other document
delivered pursuant hereto by Genlyte or GTG and (ii) except to the extent
arising from or related to any Excluded Act (as defined below) or

third party claims asserted against any of the Thomas Entities and any of
their respective subsidiaries (direct or indirect) to the extent arising from
or relating to the conduct of the business and/or operations of GTG and
its wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) subsidiaries occurring on or
after August 30, 1998. The term **"Excluded Act"** shall mean (i) any act or
failure to act of any of the Thomas Entities or any of their respective
subsidiaries (direct or indirect), occurring prior to, on or subsequent to
the Closing Date, which do not constitute Assumed Liabilities (as defined in
the Capitalization Agreement) to be indemnified by GTG pursuant to Section

Agreement or the Capitalization Agreement, any claim related to taxes, and
(iii) any matter subject to indemnification by Thomas under Section 10.2(a).
This provision is not intended to limit any right to indemnification of any
Person under this Agreement or the Capitalization Agreement. In no event
shall any indemnified party hereunder be entitled to recover more than once
from an indemnifying party with respect to any specific Loss.

  



  

(c) Subject to the consummation of the Closing, GTG and Genlyte, jointly and
severally, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Thomas and the
Transferring Affiliates and their respective affiliates from and against any
and all Loss, related to, caused by or arising from any matter subject to
indemnification by the "Company" (as defined in the Capitalization Agreement)
under the Capitalization Agreement including Section 8.2(b) thereof;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or said
Capitalization Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the
Environmental Matter is not subject to indemnification by the "Company" (as
defined in the Capitalization Agreement) under the Capitalization Agreement.

  



  

(d) Subject to the consummation of the Closing, all indemnification
obligations shall be deemed made in favor of and shall include Losses
incurred by, any partys officers, directors, agents, representatives,
subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, successors and assigns.

Thomas shall not be liable and each of Genlyte and GTG agree not to enforce

this

  



  

14      
   



  

Agreement in excess of the Purchase Price and (ii) GTG and Genlyte shall not

considered to be a contribution to capital or a return of capital.

  



  

10.3 _Matters Involving Third Parties_. If, in the case of any claim asserted
by a third party against any party to this Agreement (the **"Indemnified
Party"** ), notice shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the party
required to provide indemnification (the **"Indemnifying Party"** ) promptly
after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which
indemnity may be sought, and the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party) to assume the
defense of any claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that (i)
the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such
claim or litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such
Indemnified Partys expense, and (iii) the omission by any Indemnified Party
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
the indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the extent that
such omission results in a failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnifying Party is materially damaged as a result of such failure
to give notice. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation,
shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that
provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified
Party or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability with respect to such claim or litigation. In the event that the
Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the
defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder or any proposed
settlement of any such claim by the Indemnifying Party might be expected to
affect adversely the Indemnified Partys tax liability or the ability of the
Indemnified Party to conduct its business, or that the Indemnified Party may
have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim or any litigation relating
thereto, the Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to take over
and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation
relating to any such claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party,
provided that if the Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control,
the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim or litigation without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
accept the defense of any matter as above provided, the Indemnified Party
shall have the full right to defend against any such claim or demand and
shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claim or demand. In
any event, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in the defense of any claim or litigation subject to this Section 10.3 and
the records of each shall be available to the other with respect to such
defense.

  



  

15      
   



  

10.4 _Other Indemnification Provisions_.  Subject to consummation of the
Closing and the rights of the parties under the Capitalization Agreement
(except as specifically modified by Sections 10.2(c) and 10.2(e) hereof), the
foregoing indemnification provisions under this Article X are the sole and
exclusive remedy any party may have for any matter subject to indemnification
under Section 10.2.

deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any
such breach, or a waiver of the breach of any other term or covenant
