means of the merger of Merger Corp. with and into the Company (the "

referred to as the " **Combination** "), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " **Company

 **ARTICLE 1**

  



  

 **THE COMBINATION**

  



  

1.1 **The Merger and the LLC Merger**. Pursuant to the laws of the State
of Delaware, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, (a) Merger Corp. shall be merged with and into
the Company, and the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the right to receive the amount of cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock set forth in _Section 1.3_ below, such Merger to
take effect at the time when the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of Delaware, or at such other time as the parties may
agree upon in writing pursuant to applicable Law (the " **Effective Time**
"), and (b) immediately thereafter, Parent shall cause the Company, as the
surviving corporation of the Merger, to be merged with and into LLC, such LLC
Merger to take effect at the time when the LLC Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the " **LLC**
**Effective Time** ").

  



  

1.2 **Effect of Merger** **.  **At the Effective Time, Merger Corp. shall be
merged with and into the Company in the manner and with the effect provided
by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " **DGCL** "), the separate
corporate existence of Merger Corp. shall cease and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** "). The outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in _Section
1.3_ below. The outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Corp. shall be
converted into shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, all on
the basis, terms

  



  

2      
   



  

and conditions described in _Section 1.4_.  At the LLC Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into LLC in the manner and with the effect
provided by the DGCL and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the
separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease, LLC
shall be the surviving entity (the " **Surviving Company** "), and the
outstanding shares of Surviving Corporation Stock shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment will be made with
respect thereto, all on the basis, terms and conditions described in _Section
1.4_.

  



  

1.3 **Company Stock** **.**

  



  

1.3.1 **Merger Consideration. **(a) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this
_Article I_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive: (i)
$6.25 in cash (the " **Cash Amount** ") and (ii) a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock, the numerator of which is $6.25 and the denominator of
which is (A) $28.50, if the average of the closing sale prices of Parent
Common Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like) as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange (" **NYSE** ") for the 5 trading days
ending upon and including the trading day immediately before the Closing Date
(the " **Average** **Closing Parent Stock Price** ") is less than or equal to
$28.50, (B) the Average Closing Parent Stock Price, if such price is greater
than $28.50 and less than $34.83, or (C) $34.83, if the Average Closing
Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal to $34.83 (such fraction, for
the purposes of clarity, rounded to the nearest thousandth, the "
**Conversion Ratio** ").

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Average Closing Parent Stock Price
is less than $31.66 (the " **Current Parent Stock Price** ") and greater
than or equal to $28.50, at Parents election and in its sole and absolute
discretion, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive:  (a) the
Cash Amount, (b) cash in an amount equal to (i) the Average Closing Parent
Stock Price multiplied by (ii) the difference between (A)(I) $6.25, divided
by (II) the Average Closing Parent Stock Price, and (B)(I) $6.25, divided by
(II) the Current Parent Stock Price (the " **Additional Cash Amount** "), and
(c) a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, the numerator of which is
$6.25 and the denominator of which is the Current Parent Stock Price (the "
**Adjusted Conversion Ratio** "); _provided that_ , the Additional Cash
Amount shall be limited (but not below $0), and the denominator of the
Adjusted Conversion Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted downward to reflect
such limitation (if any), to the extent necessary to allow the aggregate
value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by all Company stockholders
in their capacities as stockholders, determined by reference to the closing
sale price of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Closing Date (the "
**Actual Closing Parent Stock Price** "), to constitute 45% of the aggregate
value of the Merger Consideration (including for this purpose amounts payable
to Dissenting Stockholders and assuming for this purpose that all Dissenting
Stockholders ultimately perfect their Dissenters Rights) payable to
all Company stockholders (including all Dissenting Stockholders) in their

  



  

3      
   



  

capacities as stockholders, all as determined in accordance with tax law
applicable in establishing adequate continuity of interest under Treas. Reg.
§1.368-1(e); and  _provided further_ that the substitution of the Additional
Cash Amount for Parent Common Stock shall not diminish the aggregate Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 1.3_, " **45% Condition** " means the
aggregate value of the Parent Common Stock to be received by all Company
stockholders in their capacities as stockholders, determined by reference to
the Actual Closing Parent Stock Price, constitutes 45% or more of the
aggregate value of the Merger Consideration (including for this purpose
amounts payable to Dissenting Stockholders and assuming for this purpose that
all Dissenting Stockholders ultimately perfect their Dissenters Rights)
payable to all Company stockholders (including all Dissenting Stockholders)
in their capacities as stockholders, all as determined in accordance with tax
law applicable in establishing adequate continuity of interest under Treas.
Reg. § 1.368-1(e).

  



  

(i) No later than 2:00 p.m. Pacific time on the second business day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, Parent shall provide the Company with
written notice (the " **Parent Notice** ") stating either: (A) that Parent
will modify the Merger Consideration to the minimum extent necessary (if at
all) to satisfy the 45% Condition (such modification to be effected by
increasing the Conversion Ratio and correspondingly reducing the Cash Amount
(which reduction shall be determined by reference to the increase in the
Conversion Ratio multiplied by the Actual Closing Parent Stock Price) to the
minimum extent necessary to satisfy the 45% Condition); or (B) that Parent
will not modify the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(ii) If the Parent Notice states that Parent will modify the Merger
Consideration, if necessary, so as to satisfy the 45% Condition, the Company
shall have the right to decline the modification of the Merger Consideration
by providing Parent, within 24 hours following the Companys receipt of the
Parent Notice, with written notice stating such position (the " **Company No
Modification Notice** "), in which case all terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including without limitation the original Merger Consideration
specified in accordance with _Section 1.3.1(a)_) shall remain in effect. If
the Company fails to deliver the Company No Modification Notice within the
time period set forth above, the Merger Consideration shall be so modified to
the minimum extent necessary (if at all) to satisfy the 45% Condition and all
other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.

  



  

(iii) If the Parent Notice states that Parent will not modify the Merger
Consideration, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
by providing Parent with written notice of termination within 24 hours
following the Companys receipt of the Parent Notice (a " **Company
Termination Notice** "), in which case this Agreement shall terminate and the
Company shall have no obligation to pay any Termination Fee to Parent. If
the Company fails to provide a Company Termination Notice (the "
**Company Non-Termination Option** "), all terms

  



  

4      
   



  

and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the original
Merger Consideration specified in accordance with _Section 1.3.1(a)_)
shall remain in effect.

  



  

1.3.2 **Conversion of Shares**. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time that is not a Dissenting
Share will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Amount, the Additional Cash Amount, if applicable, and Parent Common
Stock determined in accordance with _Section 1.3.1_ (the "
**Merger Consideration** ").

  



  

1.4 **Merger Corp. Stock**.

  



  

1.4.1 Each share of common stock of Merger Corp. issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to exist and be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. After the Effective Time, Parent, the sole holder of shares of
Merger Corp. common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, upon surrender for cancellation of a certificate representing
such shares to the Surviving Corporation, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which such shares of Merger Corp. common stock
have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_. Until so surrendered, the
certificates which prior to the Merger represented shares of Merger Corp.
common stock shall be deemed, for all corporate purposes, including voting
entitlement, to evidence ownership of the shares of the Surviving Corporation
common stock into which such shares of Merger Corp. common stock shall have
been converted.

  



  

1.4.2 Each share of common stock of Surviving Corporation issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the LLC Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the LLC Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
cease to exist and be extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment will be made with respect thereto.

  



  

1.5 **Options**. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 1.5_, the
terms and provisions of the stock options (the " **Options** ") held by those
the Company option holders under the Companys 1998 Stock Option/Stock
Issuance Plan and the Companys 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the " **Company Option Plans** ") will continue in full force
and effect following the Combination. By virtue of the Merger and at the
Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of any holder
thereof, each Option will be converted into an option to purchase the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum (rounded to the nearest
whole number, but rounded down to the nearest whole number in the case of
each Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an " **ISO** ")) of (x) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Option would have been converted in the

  



  

5      
   



  

Merger, (y) the Cash Amount into which the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Option would have been converted in the Merger
divided by the Actual Closing Parent Stock Price and (z) the Additional Cash
Amount into which the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Option would have been converted in the Merger, if any, divided by the
**** Actual Closing Parent Stock Price (the " **Option Share Number** "). The
exercise price per share for each Option after the Effective Time will be
determined by dividing the aggregate exercise price for such Option by the
Option Share Number (rounded to the nearest whole cent, but rounded up to the
nearest whole cent in the case of each Option that is intended to be an ISO).
The term, exercisability, vesting schedule, and all other terms and
conditions of each Option will to the extent permitted by Law and otherwise
reasonably practicable be unchanged; _provided that_ the exercisability of
the Options shall not accelerate as a result of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided further_ that options
granted to non-employee directors shall fully vest and the repurchase rights
shall fully lapse in accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plan.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Option that
is intended to be an ISO shall be adjusted in accordance with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code in order to preserve its status as an
ISO.

  



  

1.6 **Restricted Stock**. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
1.6_, the terms and provisions of any restricted stock purchase agreement or
similar agreement entered into pursuant to the Company Option Plans ("
**Restricted Stock Agreement** "), which is in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time and will continue in full force and effect following
the Effective Time and shall apply to all shares of Parent Common Stock held
by any Person as a result of the conversion of unvested Company Common Stock
subject to the Restricted Stock Agreement (" **Company Restricted Stock** ")
in the Merger. Subject to this _Section 1.6_, each share of Company
Restricted Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of each Restricted
Stock Agreement will to the extent permitted by Law and otherwise
reasonably practicable be unchanged; _provided that_ (i) the vesting of
the Company Restricted Stock shall not accelerate as a result of the Merger
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the portion of
the Merger Consideration consisting of the Cash Amount and any Additional
Cash Amount shall be paid only upon completion of the vesting period(s) in
the applicable Restricted Stock Agreement, plus interest on such amount
accrued from the Closing Date until the applicable vesting period date
computed at the applicable interest rate payable on one-year treasury bills
as published in the Wall Street Journal or a comparable successor rate as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion.

  



  

1.7 **Stock Splits, Etc**. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of either Company Common Stock
or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
combination, recapitalization, stock split, stock

  



  

6      
   



  

dividend, subdivision, exchange of shares, or other extraordinary
transaction, the Merger Consideration, Cash Amount, Conversion Ratio,
Additional Cash Amount and Adjusted Conversion Ratio, shall be adjusted
proportionately.

  



  

1.8 **Employee Stock Purchase Plan**. Effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company shall terminate the Companys 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

  



  

1.9 **Share Right Awards**. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
1.9_, the terms and provisions of any share right award agreement pursuant to
the Company Option Plan (" **Share Right Award** "), which is in
effect prior to the Effective Time, will continue in full force and effect
following the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and at the Effective
Time, and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, each
Share Right Award will be converted into a share right award to purchase the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (x) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which the share of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Share Right Award would have been converted in
the Merger, (y) the Cash Amount into which the share of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Share Right Award would have been converted in
the Merger divided by the Actual Closing Parent Stock Price and (z) the
Additional Cash Amount into which the share of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Share Right Award would have been converted in the
Merger, if any, divided by the Actual Closing Parent Stock Price (the "
**Share Right Award Number** "). The term, vesting schedule, and all other
terms and conditions of each Share Right Award will to the extent permitted
by Law and otherwise reasonably practicable be unchanged; _provided that_ the
vesting of a Share Right Award shall not accelerate as a result of the Merger
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

1.10 **Surrender and Cancellation of Certificat** **es**

  



  

1.10.1 **Surrender of Certificates**. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause its transfer agent (the " **Transfer Agent** ") to send a
letter to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into Parent Common Stock and cash advising such holder that upon
surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing
such shares, along with a letter of transmittal in the form enclosed therein,
the holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate representing the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash into which such shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to the provisions of _Section
1.3_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued,
or the cash portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid, to a Person
other than the Person whose name the certificate for Company Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance and payment thereof that the certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such exchange pay to Parent or its agent designated for
such purpose any transfer or other taxes required, or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent or its agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. If any holder of Company Common Stock

  



  

7      
   



  

canceled and retired in accordance with this Agreement is unable to deliver a
certificate or certificates representing such shares of the holder, Parent,
in the absence of actual notice that any shares theretofore represented by
any such certificate have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall
deliver to such holder the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
to which such holder is entitled in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement upon the presentation of the following:  (i) evidence satisfactory
to Parent (a) that such Person is the owner of the shares theretofore
represented by each certificate claimed by him, her or it to be lost,
wrongfully taken or destroyed and (b) that he, she or it is the Person who
would be entitled to present each such certificate for conversion pursuant to
this Agreement; and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably
requested by Parent to indemnify and hold Parent and the Transfer Agent
harmless.

  



  

1.10.2 **No Fractional Shares**. No certificates or scrip evidencing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any
rights as a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of a fractional share, Parent
will pay any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon
surrender of the certificates therefor an amount of cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying (a) the Actual Closing Parent Stock Price by (b)
the fractional share interest in Parent Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled. The provisions of this _Section 1.10.2_ will
apply to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each
holder thereof and each such holder will be required to
simultaneously surrender all certificates relating to shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 1.10_ in order to surrender any such certificate.

  



  

1.10.3 **Escheat**. Neither Parent, Merger Corp. nor LLC shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  



  

1.10.4 **Option Agreements**. After the Effective Time, each holder of an
Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be deemed to
hold an option exercisable for Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 1.5_.

  



  

1.10.5 **Treasury Shares**. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock or other Company capital stock held in the treasury of the
Company immediately before the Effective Time will be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment will be made with
respect thereto.

  



  

1.10.6 **Withholding Rights**. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as Parent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of

  



  

8      
   



  

state, local or foreign tax law and shall, in accordance with the applicable
Law, pay any such withheld amounts to the appropriate government agency. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid by
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

  



  

1.11 **Dissenters  Rights**.

  



  

1.11.1 **Notice**. Company stockholders desiring to dissent from the Merger
and obtain payment of the fair value of their shares of Company Common Stock
in lieu of the Merger Consideration may exercise their dissenters rights
under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" **Dissenters  Rights**").
The Proxy Statement (as that term is defined in _Section 2.1.6_) sent by
the Company to its stockholders in accordance with _Section 3.1.1_
will include a notice complying with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL concerning the rights of stockholders to exercise Dissenters Rights and
a copy of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

  



  

1.11.2 **Rights of Dissenting Shares**. Shares of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and held by any
stockholder who has, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, delivered a
written notice of objection and payment demand accompanied by the required
certification (" **Dissenting Shares** ") will not be converted as described
in _Section 1.3_ but will from and after the Effective Time represent only
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due under
the DGCL.  The Company will give Parent prompt notice upon receipt by the
Company of any payment demand from any such stockholder of the Company (a "
**Dissenting Stockholder** "). The Company will not, before the Effective
Time, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any request pursuant to the exercise of
Dissenters Rights.  Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled,
pursuant to the DGCL, to payment for his, her, or its Dissenting Shares will
receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Dissenting Stockholder rescinds, fails to perfect, or
otherwise loses Dissenters Rights either before or after the Effective Time,
such stockholders shares of Company Common Stock will be converted into the
right to receive Parent Common Stock and cash, as of the Effective Time, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

1.12 **Stock Transfer Books**. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Merger Corp. will be closed and there will be no further
registration of transfers of Merger Corp. capital stock or other securities
thereafter on the records of Merger Corp. At the LLC Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will be no
further registration of transfers of the Company capital stock or other
securities thereafter on the records of the Company.

  



  

9      
   



  

1.13 **Closing**. The closing of the Merger and the LLC Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP,
200 Crescent Court, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, at 9:00 a.m. local time on
September 30, 2004, or on the Condition Completion Date (as defined below),
or on such other date and/or at such other place and time as the Company,
Parent, Merger Corp. and LLC may agree (the " **Closing Date** "). The "
**Condition Completion Date** " shall be the business day on which the last
of the conditions set forth in _Article IV_ hereof shall have been
fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions which, by their terms, are
to occur at Closing).

  



  

1.14 **Subsequent Actions**. If, at any time after the LLC Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company its right, title or interest in, to, or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company, Merger Corp. or LLC acquired or to be

party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy

a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The

the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to the
Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement. In connection with the Parents efforts to obtain such

the stockholders of the Company and include in the Proxy Statement
such recommendation.

  



  

(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective directors, officers or employees
or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
advisor, agent or representative (collectively, " **Representatives** ")
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal (as
defined below) or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with, any Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company agrees it will take the necessary steps to inform promptly its
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 3.2.2_.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal (as defined below) that is reasonably likely to be completed, and
which Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section
3.2.2(b)_, the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding
such Company Takeover Proposal.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Company Takeover Proposa** l" shall mean
any bona fide, unsolicited (i) proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination
involving the Company, (ii) proposal for the issuance of 20% or more of the
equity securities of the Company as consideration for the assets or
securities of another person or (iii) proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company, or assets
(including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) that represent
20% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Company Superior Proposal** " shall mean
any offer made by a third party that if completed would result in such Person
(or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity
in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a
merger) or 50% or more of the total

  



  

37      
   



  

consolidated assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement).

  



  

(c) The Company will promptly notify Parent in writing if any such inquiries,
proposals or offers are received by, and such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives relating to a
Company Takeover Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, on the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
negotiations or discussions. The Company also will promptly request each
person that has executed a confidentiality agreement after January 1, 2003 in
connection with its consideration of a Company Takeover Proposal to return
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose
to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
unanimous approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such
Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the
Merger or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend,
adopt or approve, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as an " **Company Adverse Recommendation
Change** ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
or allow the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to any the Company Takeover Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to _Section 3.2.2(b)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may (I)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is
advisable to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law or (II) in response to a
Company Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section
3.2.2_, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.2.5_; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee as provided in _Section 5.4.2_.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 3.2.2_ shall prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act

  



  

38      
   



  

or (ii) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would
constitute or is reasonably likely to lead to a violation of applicable Law.

  



  

3.2.3 **Investigations**. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange
of information, the Company agrees to give Parent and its representatives and
agents reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior
to the Effective Time to all its premises, books and records, agreements and
files and work papers of its independent auditors and to cause the officers
of the Company to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to its business and properties as Parent shall
from time to time reasonably request. Without limitation of the foregoing,
the Company shall permit Parent to conduct an operations review during which
Parent shall have access to the facility managers, sales and marketing
managers, finance officers, and technology, environmental and human resource
managers of each Company operating facility. Any such investigations (a)
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the Companys business; and (b) shall not diminish any of the
representations and warranties hereunder.

  



  

3.2.4 **Retention of Employees Prior to Closing**.  Subject to _Section
3.2.1_, the Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to retain the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries until the Closing Date, and to assist the
Surviving Company or Parent in securing the employment after the Closing Date
of those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom the Surviving
Company or Parent makes or intends to make offers of employment.  The
Company shall notify Parent promptly if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any
employee with a title of operational director or above terminates employment
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement
but prior to the Closing.

  



  

3.2.5 **Company Affiliate Representation Letters**.  To insure compliance
with Rule 145 under the Securities Act, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each of the Companys directors, executive
officers and beneficial owners of 5% or more of Company Common Stock to
execute and deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing, a representation
letter, substantially in the form attached as **Exhibit F** (the "
**Company Affiliate Representation Letter** ").

  



  

3.3 **Covenants of Parent**. Parent covenants and agrees as follows:

  



  

3.3.1 **Conduct of Business**. Before the Effective Time, Parent will not
take or omit to take any action that could reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect and will not, without the prior written

the Surviving Company. After the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Company Employees shall be entitled to such notice as
Parent provides to its other employees from time to time.

  



  

41      
   



  

(iii) Parent agrees, and agrees to cause the Surviving Company, to adhere to
the terms and conditions set forth in **Schedule 3.3.2(f)**.

  



  

3.3.3 **Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance**.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that, and shall cause the Surviving Company to assume the
obligations associated with, all rights of the individuals who on or prior to
the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **Indemnitees** ") to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time as provided in the respective Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any indemnification
agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Company shall have no obligation to
provide such indemnification to the extent that it is ultimately determined
that such indemnification is prohibited under applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause (i) the
Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability the Company Agreement of the
Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees
with respect to limitation of certain liabilities of directors, officers,
employees and agents and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of
this Agreement in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company
and (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Company to
contain the current provisions regarding indemnification of directors,
officers, employees and agents which provisions in each case shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

  



  

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable to the Companys directors and officers currently covered by such
insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided,
however_ , that, if the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance expires, is terminated or is canceled, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to, obtain directors and officers liability insurance
covering such acts or omissions with respect to each such person on terms
with respect to such coverage and

  



  

42      
   



  

amount no less favorable to the Companys directors and officers currently
covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect immediately
prior to the date of such expiration, termination or cancellation; _provided,
further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend
per annum of coverage in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such coverage (or such coverage as is available for 150%
of such annual premium). Alternatively, with the consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company may purchase "tail"
insurance coverage covering a period of six years after the Effective Time,
at a cost no greater than that set forth in the preceding sentence, that
provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage
described above.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 3.3.3_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

  



  

(e) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 3.3.3_.

  



  

(f) Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall unconditionally
guarantee the timely payment of all funds owed by, and the timely performance
of all other obligations of, the Surviving Company under this _Section
3.3.3_. Parent agrees that its payment obligations hereunder are
unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement against the Surviving Company or any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor
(other than the defenses of statute of limitations, which are not waived).
Parent hereby acknowledges that its obligations under this _Section 3.3.3_
constitute a guaranty of payment and not merely of collectability and Parent
hereby waives (i) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
protest and order in connection with this guarantee and (ii) any requirement
that any party enforcing the guarantee exhaust any right to take any action
against the Surviving Company or any other Person prior to or
contemporaneously with proceeding to exercise any right against Parent
hereunder.

  



  

3.3.4 **Stock Exchange Listing**. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued (a) in the
Merger, (b) upon the exercise of the Options, or (c) upon exchange of Company
Restricted Stock, receipt of shares pursuant to Stock Right Awards or
purchase of shares pursuant to the

  



  

43      
   



  

Companys 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

3.3.5 **Registration Statement on Form S-8**. No later than the Effective
Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock at least equal to the sum of (a) number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Options pursuant to  _Section 1.5_, (b) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of
Company Restricted Stock pursuant to _Section 1.6_, and (c) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of Share Right
Awards pursuant to _Section 1.9_. The registration statement shall be
kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as any such
Options, Company Restricted Stock and Share Right Awards remain outstanding.

  



  

3.4 **Covenants of Merger Corp. and LLC**. ** **Each of Merger Corp. and LLC
covenants and agrees that, prior to the Effective Time or the LLC Effective
Time, as applicable, each of them will not engage in any business activities
or liquidate, merge into or consolidate with any other corporation or permit
any other corporation to merge into or consolidate with it; or increase
its authorized capital stock; or issue options, rights or warrants to
purchase any of its capital stock.

result of a modification of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section

Manges LLP, dated as of the Closing Date and addressed to the Company, to the
effect that the Combination will constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and _ provided,_ that if Weil,

48      
   



  

5.2.9 by the Company if there has been a material breach by Parent of
