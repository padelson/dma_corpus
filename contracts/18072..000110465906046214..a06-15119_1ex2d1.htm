 **ARTICLE II

 **Section 2.1 Effect on Company Stock**. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of Buyer or
the Company or the holders of any securities thereof:

  

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Common Stock, $1.00 par
value per share, of the Company (" ** _Company Common Stock_** ,") that (i)
has been reacquired by the Company and is held as authorized but unissued
Company Common Stock, (ii) is owned by any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii)
is owned by Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer, will automatically be cancelled

cancelled and retired, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Company Common Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive Merger Consideration without interest upon the
surrender of the proper documentary evidence to the Paying Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.4(c)_.

     

   



  

 **Section 2.2** ** Effect on Company Options and Other Company Securities;
Suspension of DRIP and Employee Savings Plans**.

  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, contingent on consummation of
the Closing, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (a " **
_Company Stock Option_** ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the Companys 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
(including the Companys 2000 Director Stock Award Plan (the " **
_Director Stock Plan_** ")) (collectively, the " ** _Company Option Plan_**
") that is not vested, will immediately vest and become exercisable by the
holder. If this Agreement is terminated, all Company Stock Options that were
otherwise unvested will revert to their original status. The Company will
exercise reasonable efforts to cause all holders of Company Stock Options to
either exercise such options or irrevocably waive his or her rights to do so.
At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option with respect to which the
holder has delivered to the Company a proper exercise notice will be
considered exercised. The Common Stock issuable in respect of such
exercise will be deemed issued without the necessity of issuing a stock
certificate and will be treated as Company Common Shares in the Merger. The
Paying Agent, on Buyers behalf, will deduct the exercise price payable in
connection with the exercise of Company Stock Options from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Company Common
Shares deemed issued in respect of the exercised option; it will not be
necessary for holders of Company Stock Options to tender the exercise price.
Any Company Stock Options with respect to which the Payment Agent has not
received notice of exercise before termination of the Payment Fund will be
cancelled.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, all remaining restrictions with respect to shares
of Company restricted stock issued pursuant to the Company Option Plan (the "
** _Company Restricted Shares_** ") will expire and all of the Company
Restricted Shares will be fully vested and will be treated as Company Common
Shares in the Merger, _provided, however_ , that the amount payable by the
Paying Agent in respect of such Company Common Shares shall be reduced by all
applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld by the
Company or otherwise with respect thereto.

  

(c) Prior to the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company will take such actions and enter into such agreements to cause (i)
all outstanding Stock Units (as defined in the Director Stock Plan) (the " **
_Company Stock Units_** ") to be cancelled and (ii) to be issued to
each holder of Company Stock Units a number of Company Common Shares equal to
number of Company Stock Units such Person holds, which will be treated as
Company Common Shares in the Merger, in each case to be effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause the Companys
Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the " ** _Company DRIP_** ") **** and
all rights thereunder to be suspended immediately following the Investment
Date (as defined in the Company DRIP) ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with the effect of such suspension being that no offering
period will commence or continue under such plan during the period of such
suspension.

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause the Companys
Employee Retirement Savings Plan (2002 Restatement) (the " ** _Company
Employee Savings Plan_** " and,

     

   



  

collectively with the Company Option Plan and the Company DRIP, the " **
_Company Stock Plans_** "), to be amended to suspend investments in
Qualifying Employer Securities (as defined therein) effective as of the last
business day prior to the Effective Time.

  

 **Section 2.3 Conversion of Merger Sub Common Shares**. Each share of
common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable

certificate evidencing ownership of any shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

 **Section 2.4 Payment Procedures**.

  

(a) _Payment Agent; Payment Fund_. Not less than five business days prior to
the Effective Time, Buyer will authorize a banking or other financial
institution selected by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to the Company to
act as Payment Agent hereunder (the " ** _Payment Agent_** ") with
respect to the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer will deposit,
or will cause to be deposited, with the Payment Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Shares, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in connection with
the Merger (the " ** _Payment Fund_** "). Such funds shall be invested by the
Payment Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, provided that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposits,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $500,000,000; provided however that (i) none of the
foregoing will affect Buyers obligation to pay the Merger Consideration as
set forth in this _Section 2.4_ and (ii) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
will promptly replace any losses relating to the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced
by, such investments will be payable to Buyer. The Payment Agent will,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Buyer, deliver the applicable
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Payment Fund.
At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will provide to the Payment
Agent a certified ledger setting forth the names and amounts held by the
holders of all Company Stock Options. The Payment Fund will not be used for
any purpose other than as set forth in this _Section 2.4(a)_.

  

(b) _Instructions_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Common Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent and
will be in a form and have such other provisions as Buyer may specify and
that are acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and shares that are held
in book-entry form (" ** _Book-Entry Shares_** ") ** __** in exchange for the
consideration contemplated hereby, if not previously surrendered. " **
_Certificate_** " means a stock certificate representing the applicable
holders Company Common Shares or, in the case of Company Stock

     

   



  

Options exercised for Company Common Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2_, the
holders applicable stock option agreement together with the proper executed
exercise notice.

  

(c) _Procedures_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Payment Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_, after giving effect to any
required withholding Tax. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares that is not registered in the Companys transfer records, a
check for the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to this _Section
2.4_, if applicable, may be issued to such a transferee if such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares are properly endorsed (as applicable) or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the transferee will pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to any person, employee,
individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or
any other non-governmental entity (including any foreign entity) or any
governmental or regulatory authority or body (including any foreign entity)
(each a " ** _Person_** "), other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

(d) _Tax Withholding_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub
and the Payment Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (without
duplication) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " ** _Code_** ") or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law and to pay such amounts to the applicable taxing
authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Payment Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. " ** _Tax_** " means: (i) any federal, state, local or foreign net
income, gross income, gross receipts, windfall profit, severance, property,
production, sales, use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll,
estimated, withholding, alternative or add-on minimum, ad valorem, value-
added, transfer, stamp, or environmental (including taxes under Section 59A
of the Code) tax, or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other
like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest
or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed by any governmental
authority and (ii) any liability in respect of any items described in clause
(i) payable by reason of contract, assumption, transferee liability,
operation of law, Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or
successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision under law) or
otherwise.

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the Companys
stock transfer books will be closed, and there will be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Common

     

   



  

Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent for any reason, they will be cancelled as
provided in this _Article II_.

  

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) which remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time may
be delivered to Buyer upon its demand, and any holder of Company Common
Shares who has not theretofore exchanged such holders Certificate(s) or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_ and the instructions
set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the
Effective Time will thereafter look only to Buyer or its agent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each Company Common Share such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
the Payment Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any amount
properly delivered or deliverable to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  

 **Section 2.5 Dissenting Shares. **Shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not Company
Common Shares deemed issued for exercised Company Stock Options pursuant to
_Section 2.2_) that are held by a holder who (a) has not voted such shares
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, (b) is entitled
to, and who has, properly demanded and perfected dissenters rights for such
Company Common Shares in accordance with the WBCA and (c) has not effectively
withdrawn or forfeited such dissenters rights prior to the Effective Time
(the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** "), will not be converted into a right to
receive Merger Consideration at the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws, forfeits or otherwise loses
such holders dissenters rights, (i) such Company Common Shares will be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_, without any interest therefor, and (ii) the procedures in
_Section 2.4_ will apply with respect to the payment of Merger Consideration
with regard to such Company Common Shares. The Company will give Buyer prompt
notice of any written notice received by the Company for dissenters rights
with respect to Company Common Shares, and Buyer will have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  

 **Section 2.6 Lost Certificates**. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against them with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

     

   



  

 **Section 2.7 Adjustment of Merger Consideration**. In the event that the
Company changes, or establishes a record date for changing, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination or similar transaction and the record date therefor is or will be
prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration will be appropriately,
equitably and proportionately adjusted in light of such stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or
similar transaction.

  

 **ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company represents and warrants to Buyer, except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedules dated as of the date hereof (the " ** _Company
Disclosure Schedules_** "), and except as disclosed in the documents

SEC Documents_** ") (it being understood that any matter set forth in the
Company Filed SEC Documents will be deemed to qualify any representation

of such matter in the Company Filed SEC Documents is made in such a way as to
make its relevance to the information called for by such representation or
warranty readily apparent), as follows:

  

 **Section 3.1 Organization**. The Company is validly existing under the
laws of the State of Washington and has all requisite power and authority
to carry on its businesses as now being conducted, except where the failure
to be so existing or to have such power and authority would not, individually

duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing (as
applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its businesses or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing (as applicable) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of its
Articles of Incorporation and bylaws. " ** _Company Material Adverse
Effect_** " means any event, effect, change or development that, individually
or in the aggregate with other events, effects, changes or developments (i)

as a whole or (ii) has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material
and adverse effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby by
the End Date; provided, however, that to the extent any event, effect, change
or development is caused by or results from any of the following, in each
case, it will not be taken into account in determining whether there has been
(or would reasonably be expected to be) a Company Material Adverse Effect:
(A) general economic, legal or regulatory conditions affecting the gas
utility industry as a whole, except to the extent the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are materially and adversely affected in a
disproportionate manner as compared to comparable gas utilities; (B) the

     

   



  

announcement of the execution of this Agreement; (C) any failure by the

such effect, event, change or development which affect or otherwise relate to
or result from the failure to meet revenue or earnings predictions prepared
by the Company or revenue or earnings predictions of equity analysts or to
the receipt of any credit ratings downgrade may be deemed to constitute, or
be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would
reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect); (D)
changes in laws, rules or regulations of any Governmental Entity affecting
the energy market as a whole except to the extent the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are materially and adversely affected in a
disproportionate manner as compared to comparable participants in the energy
market; (E) any orders or decisions by the Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission (the " ** _WUTC_** ") or Oregon Public Utility
Commission (the " ** _OPUC_** ") regarding the Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (F) any change in generally accepted accounting
principles (" ** _GAAP_** ") by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
SEC or any other regulatory body; (G) any change in the price of the Company
Common Shares (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise
or contributing to any such change in the price of the Company Common Shares
may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material
Adverse Effect); (H) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or
war (whether or not declared), or the declaration by the United States of a
national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis
or natural disaster, in each case that does not directly affect the assets or
properties of, or communities served by, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (I) the effects of weather or other meteorological events;
or (J) the compliance of any party hereto with the terms of this Agreement.

  

 **Section 3.2 Subsidiaries**.

ending on the date hereof to take corrective action or make a filing under
any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan or Compensation
Commitment, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any Knowledge
of any plan defect which would qualify for correction

     

   



  

under any such program, except for any action, filing or plan defect that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There is no dispute, arbitration, grievance, action, suit or claim
(other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened involving such Benefit Plans or the assets of such plans
that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation under
any welfare plans or otherwise to provide health or death benefits to or in
respect of former employees of the Company, except as specifically required
by the continuation requirements of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable
state law. No plan or arrangement disclosed on Section 3.12(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules that provides health or death benefits to or in respect
of former employees of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate contains provisions
that by their terms prohibit the Company or an ERISA Affiliate from amending
or terminating such plan or arrangement at any time without the consent of
any other Person and without incurring liability thereunder other than in
respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, directly or indirectly, any

Code, (iv) under Sections 511, 4971, 4972, 4976, 4977, 4978, 4979, 4979A,
4980B or 5000 of the Code or (v) under Title IV of ERISA that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof, incurred and does not expect to incur any
material withdrawal liability with respect to a "multiemployer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (a " ** _Multiemployer Plan_**
") (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate of
the Company). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived or extended, has been required to be filed for any pension plan or by
any ERISA Affiliate of the Company within the 12-month period ending on the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(e) All contributions or premiums required to be paid under the terms of any
Benefit Plan maintained by the Company, collective bargaining agreement or by
any applicable laws as of the date hereof have been timely made or have
been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Company Filed SEC Documents. No Benefit Plan
maintained by the Company that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not
waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
and the Company does not have an outstanding funding waiver. The Company has
not provided, and is not required to provide, security to any Benefit Plan
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  

(f) Under each Benefit Plan maintained by the Company which is a single-
employer plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA), as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Benefit Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the

     

   



  

then current value of the assets of such Benefit Plan by more than
$16,000,000 as of the date hereof, and there has been no material
adverse effect in the financial condition of such Benefit Plan since the last
day of the most recent plan year.

  

(g) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, approval of this
Agreement, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will: (i) entitle any employees of the Company to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon termination of employment, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans or Compensation Commitments, (iii)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Benefit
Plans or Compensation Commitments or (iv) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any of the
Benefit Plans maintained by the Company or Compensation Commitments.

  

(h) The Company is not a party to any agreement, plan or arrangement that,
individually or considered collectively with such other agreements, plans or
arrangements, could reasonably be expected to result in payments, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that would
constitute a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those
terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

  

(i) To the extent applicable, each Benefit Plan has complied with the
"secondary payor" requirements of Section 1862(b)(2) of the Social Security
Act and Section 1860D-13(b)(6) of the Social Security Act.

  

(j) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliates maintains, sponsors, or
contributed to (or has at any time maintained, sponsored or contributed to,
or been obligated to maintain, sponsor or contribute to): any welfare
benefit fund within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code.

  

(k) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate are not subject to any legal,
contractual, equitable, or other obligation to (1) establish as of any date
any employee benefit plan of any nature, including, without limitation,
any pension, profit sharing, welfare, post-retirement welfare, stock option,
stock or cash award, non-qualified deferred compensation or executive
compensation plan, policy or practice; or (2) continue any Benefit Plan
listed hereunder or otherwise (or to continue their participation in any such
Benefit Plan) after the Closing Date; The Company may, in any manner, subject
to the limitations imposed by applicable law or any applicable collective
bargaining agreement, and without the consent of any employee, beneficiary or
other Person, prospectively terminate, modify or amend any Benefit Plan,
whether or not listed hereunder (or its participation in any such Benefit
Plan) effective as of any date; and has made no representations or
communications (directly or indirectly, orally, in writing or otherwise) with
respect to participation, eligibility for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual
coverage or other material terms of any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing
Date to any employee, beneficiary or other Person other than any such
representations or communications which are in accordance with the terms and
provisions of each such Benefit Plan as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

since the effective date of Section 409A of the Code, complied in operation
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code as set forth in

including enforcement of any reserved right to amend, modify, suspend, revoke

of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto.

  

(b) The Surviving Corporation will purchase officers and directors
liability insurance with an insurer substantially comparable to the insurer
under the Companys current policy of at least the same coverage and amounts,
containing terms and conditions no less favorable to the insured for a period
of at least six years after the Effective Time and, prior to the Effective
Time, Buyer will provide evidence to the Company of such insurance.

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives and will be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and the Company.

  

 **Section 6.9 Appropriate Actions; Consents; Filings**.

  

(a) The Company and Buyer will cooperate with each other and use (and will
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and
applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary
or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining the Buyer Required
Statutory Approvals and the Company Required Statutory Approvals and other
actions requested in order to satisfy the conditions to the parties
obligations set forth in _Article VII_.

(b) Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Buyer
and the Company will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the material information
relating to Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or material
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and
Buyer will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  

(c) (i)  Promptly after the date hereof, Buyer and the Company will establish
a regulatory approval team (the " ** _Regulatory Approval Team_** "), the
chairperson (the " ** _Chairperson_** ") of which will be Bruce Imsdahl or
such other person as may be designated by Buyer and the other members of
which (the " ** _Regulatory Approval Coordinators_** ") will consist of
representatives designated by the Company (the " ** _Company Coordinators_**
") and representatives designated by Buyer (the " ** _Buyer Coordinators_**
"), which will be equal in number unless Buyer and the Company otherwise
agree. The Chairperson will assign areas of responsibility to the Regulatory
Approval Coordinators. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Regulatory Approval Team will formulate the approach to be taken with
respect to obtaining the Company Required Statutory Approvals and coordinate
filings for such approvals as set forth below. The primary responsibility for
formulating the approach to be taken with respect to obtaining the Company
Required Statutory Approvals will reside with the entire Regulatory Approval
Team and not a committee thereof. The responsibility for formulating the
approach to be taken with respect to all required approvals from Governmental
Entities (including but not limited to the Buyer Required Statutory
Approvals) other than the Company Required Statutory Approvals will reside
with Buyer, unless Buyer otherwise agrees; provided, however, that Buyer will
(A) regularly consult with the Company regarding such approvals and (B) not
agree to any terms or conditions contained in or relating to such approvals
without the Companys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

(ii) No committee of the Regulatory Approval Team or any member thereof or of
the Regulatory Approval Team will make or commit to make any concessions,
agreements or other undertakings with or to any Governmental Entity or other
Person in connection with obtaining the Company Required Statutory Approvals
or otherwise consummating the Merger and the other transactions related to
the Merger without the prior approval of Buyer and the Company.

  

(d) The Company and Buyer each will, through the Regulatory Approval Team,
keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notice or other material communications received by
Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity and (ii) providing the other
with copies of any materials to be provided to any Governmental Entities, in
each case with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

(e) Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company and Buyer each will, upon request by the other, furnish the other
with all information concerning

     

   



  

itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement or any other material statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

(f) The Company agrees to provide, and shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to cause its officers, employees and advisors to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyers
arrangement of financing in connection with the Merger, including (x)
participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions,
management presentation sessions, road shows and meetings with rating
agencies, (y) preparation of business projections or financial or other
information required to be included in offering memoranda, prospectuses or
similar documents and (z) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at
Buyers expense, comfort letters of accountants and consents of accountants
for use of their reports in connection with such financing and legal opinions
with respect to the Company required to be delivered in connection with such
financing. Buyer shall provide copies of any materials that contain
information provided to Buyer by the Company that are to be provided to third
parties in connection with any such financing efforts.

  

(g) No investigation or exchange of information or other action pursuant to
this Agreement will be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by any party to this Agreement. In the event of a termination of this
Agreement for any reason (other than because of a breach by the other party),
each party will promptly return or destroy, or cause to be returned or
destroyed, all nonpublic information obtained from the other party or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  

(h) The Company will be solely responsible with respect to all matters
related to the Companys general rate application with the WUTC (docket number
UG-060256) (the " ** _Rate Case_** "), including all communications and
filings with the WUTC or any other third parties related thereto; provided
that the Company will (i) regularly consult with Buyer regarding the Rate
Case, (ii) promptly furnish Buyer with copies of notice or other material
communications received by the Company from any third party with respect to
the Rate Case, (iii) provide Buyer with copies of any materials to be
provided to the WUTC with respect to the Rate Case and (iv) not settle or
compromise all or any portion of the Rate Case without Buyers prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided, however,
that such consent will not constitute a waiver of, otherwise have any effect
on the rights of Buyer regarding, the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_.

  

 **Section 6.10 Charitable Contributions**. Following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will honor and pay all commitments of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to charitable contributions and local
community support that are set forth on Section 6.10(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules.

  

 **Section 6.11 Further Assurances**. If at any time after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation will consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of

     

   



  

the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, permits, licenses or
assets of the Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf  the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such
other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest,
perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of the Company and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

  

 **ARTICLE VII

conditions:

  

(a) _Shareholder Approval_. The Company Shareholder Approval will have been
obtained.

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, an " **
_Order_** "), and no federal or state Governmental Entity will have
instituted any action, suit or proceeding that is pending seeking any such
Order.

and such Final Orders will not impose terms or conditions that, in the
aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (but excluding, solely for the purposes of this 
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, matters described in clause (E) of the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect"). " ** _Final Order_** " means any action
by the relevant Governmental Entity which has not been reversed, stayed,
enjoined, set aside, annulled or suspended, with respect to which any waiting
period prescribed by law before the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated has expired, and as to which all conditions to the consummation
of such transactions prescribed by law, regulation or order have been
satisfied.

     

   



  

(iii) Other than the filings provided for in _Section 1.3_, _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ and  _(ii)_ , and in Section 4.3(b)(1) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedules, all other notices, reports and other filings required
to be made prior to the Effective Time by the Company or Buyer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries with, and all other consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations required to be obtained prior to the
Effective Time by the Company or Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company and Buyer will have
been made or obtained, as the case may be, except for those the failure to be
made or obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect (in each case
considering the operations of Buyer and the Company separately).

  

 **Section 7.2 Conditions to the Obligations of the Company to Effect the
Merger**. The obligation of the Company to effect the Merger will be subject
to the fulfillment at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
additional conditions:

  

(a) _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of Buyer and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement (i) will be
true and correct with respect to those matters that are qualified by Material
Adverse Effect or materiality and (ii) will be true and correct in all
material respects with respect to those matters that are not so qualified, in
each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as
though made on and as of the Effective Time (except that any representation
and warranty that expressly speaks as of a specified date will be determined
as of such specified date). The Company will have received a certificate
signed by Buyers Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to such
effect.

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations_. Buyer and Merger Sub will have performed
in all material respects all obligations and complied in all material

developments, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) _Consents Under Agreements_. Buyer will have obtained the consent or
approval of each Person whose consent or approval will be required under any
Contract to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except those
to be obtained pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_, and those for which the failure
to obtain such consent or approval would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

 **Section 7.3 Conditions to the Obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub to
Effect the Merger**. The obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub to effect the
Merger will be subject to the fulfillment at or prior to the Effective Time
of the following additional conditions:

     

   



  

(a) _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (i) will be true and
correct with respect to those matters that are qualified by Material Adverse
Effect or materiality, (ii) will, except with respect to Section 3.10(d), be
true and correct in all material respects with respect to those matters
that are not so qualified and (iii) with respect to Section 3.10(d), will be
true and correct except where the failure to be so true and correct would
in the aggregate not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, in each case as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as though made on
and as of the Effective Time (except that any representation and warranty
that expressly speaks as of a specified date will be determined as of such
specified date). Buyer will have received a certificate signed on behalf of
the Company by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer to such effect.

or approval of each Person whose consent or approval will be required under
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
except those to be obtained pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_, and those for
which the failure to obtain such consent or approval would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or, after giving
effect to the Merger, a material adverse effect on Buyer.

  

(e) _FIRPTA_.  Prior to the Closing on the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause to be delivered to Buyer an executed affidavit, in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2), certifying that an interest in the
Company is not a U.S. real property interest within the meaning of Section
897(c) of the Code and sets forth the Companys name, address and taxpayer

 **ARTICLE VIII

Shareholder Approval (the date of any such termination, the " **
_Termination Date_** "):

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

  

(b) by either Buyer or the Company if (i) any Government Authority of
competent jurisdiction has issued a Final Order denying the grant of a
Required Buyer Statutory Approval

     

   



  

or a Company Required Statutory Approval, in each case as a result of which
the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ cannot be satisfied, or (ii) any
Governmental Entity will have enacted, issued, promulgated or entered any
statute, law, ordinance, regulation, judgment, injunction, order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action which is a Final Order permanently
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall otherwise have performed or
observed the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

  

(c) by Buyer if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty will have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, in each case such that _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_
would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured within 60 days after written notice thereof is given by
Buyer to the Company;

  

(d) by Buyer if (i) the Companys Board of Directors has not recommended, or
has withdrawn or qualified or modified in any manner adverse to Buyer
its recommendation of, this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) the Companys
Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) has entered into a definitive
agreement for or recommended any Takeover Proposal, (iii) the Company has
breached _Section 5.2_ in any material respect or (iv) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock of
the Company is commenced, and the Companys Board of Directors fails to

shareholders within ten days after such commencement (including by taking no
position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer by its shareholders);

  

(e) by the Company prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval if (i)
the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive
agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and
the Company notifies Buyer in writing that it intends to enter into such an
agreement, attaching the most current version of such agreement to such
notice, (ii) Buyer does not make, within five business days of receipt of the
Companys written notification of its intention to enter into a definitive
agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines, in its reasonable good faith judgment after
consultation with its financial and other advisors, is at least as favorable
(taking into account (A) all financial and strategic considerations,
including relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Takeover Proposal and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement deemed relevant by the Board of Directors, (B) the identity of
the third party making such Takeover Proposal and (C) the conditions and
prospects for completion of such Takeover Proposal) to the shareholders of
the Company as the Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company prior to

to Buyer required thereby and (2) to notify Buyer promptly in writing if
its intention to enter into a definitive agreement referred to in its
notification changes at any time after giving such notification;

     

   



  

(f) by the Company if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty will have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, in each case such that _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured within 60 days after written notice thereof is given by
the Company to Buyer;

  

(g) by either the Company or Buyer if at the Company Shareholders Meeting
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof), the Company Shareholder
Approval is not obtained; or

  

(h) by either Buyer or the Company if the Merger has not been consummated by
the date which is nine months after the date of this Agreement (the " ** _End
Date_** "); provided, however, that if all other conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied on the Closing Date) are satisfied except that the WUTC Approval
and the OPUC Approval have not been obtained, either Buyer or the Company, by
written notice delivered to the other party prior to the End Date, may extend
such period by six months after the End Date; provided, further, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(i)_ will not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to
occur on or before the End Date.

  

 **Section 8.2 Effect of Termination**.

  

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Buyer as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement will forthwith become
void and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer or
the Company or their respective officers or directors, except with respect to
_Section 3.22_,  _Section 4.10_, _Section 6.4_, this _Section 8.2_ and
_Article IX_; provided, however, that nothing herein will relieve any party
for liability for any willful or knowing breach hereof.

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_,
then the rights of Buyer to pursue all legal remedies available will survive
such termination unimpaired and no election of remedies will be deemed to be
made, and further, if (i) at or prior to the Termination Date a
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced, commenced or
otherwise communicated or made known to the Companys Board of Directors (or
any person shall have publicly announced, commenced or otherwise communicated
or made known an intention to the Companys Board of Directors, whether or
not conditional, to make a Takeover Proposal) and (ii) within 12 months
after the Termination Date, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries either
becomes a party to any definitive, binding agreement with respect to a
Takeover Proposal (which need not be the same Takeover Proposal described in
clause (i)) or consummates a transaction that would constitute a Takeover
Proposal (which need not be the same Takeover Proposal described in clause
(i)), then, in either case, the Company will pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the Termination Fee.

     

   



  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Buyer pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ or (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, then
the Company will pay to Buyer, an amount equal to the Termination Fee.

  

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, the rights of the Company to pursue all legal remedies available
will survive such termination unimpaired and no election of remedies will be
deemed to have been made.

  

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Buyer pursuant
to _Section 8.1(b)_,  _Section 8.1(g)_ (other than a termination of this
Agreement by reason of the issuance of a Final Order by the North Dakota
Public Service Commission or the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
denying the grant of a Buyer Required Statutory Approval) or _Section
8.1(h)_, and (i) at or prior to the Termination Date a Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly announced, commenced or otherwise communicated or
made known to an executive officer or the Board of Directors of the Company
(or any person shall have publicly announced, commenced or otherwise
communicated or made known an intention to an executive officer or the Board
of Directors of the Company, whether or not conditional, to make a Takeover
Proposal) and (ii) within twelve months after the binding Termination Date,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries either became a party to any
definitive, binding agreement, with respect to a Takeover Proposal (which
need not be the same Takeover Proposal described in clause (i)) or
consummates a transaction that would constitute a Takeover Proposal (which
need not be the same Takeover Proposal described in clause (i)), then, in
either case, the Company will pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Termination
Fee.

  

(f) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within two business days after the date giving
rise to the obligations to make such payment.

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " ** _Termination Fee_** " shall mean
$9,000,000.

  

(h) The Company and Buyer acknowledge that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Buyer or the Company, as
applicable, would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for any of the amounts set forth in this _Section 8.2_,
the Company will pay to Buyer, its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit.

  

(i) Neither the Company nor Buyer, as the case may be, may terminate this
Agreement, and receive any applicable fees pursuant to this _Section 8.2_,
under more than one subsection of _Section 8.1_.

Any such notice or communication will be deemed given (i) when made, if made
by hand delivery, (ii) when sent, if delivered via email, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the party sending such notice or communication shall
also concurrently telephone the intended recipient of such notice or
communication that such a notice or communication has been sent by email,
(iii) upon confirmation of receipt, if made by facsimile between the hours of
9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in the recipient partys time zone, (iv) one
business day after being deposited with a next-day courier, postage prepaid,
or (v) three business days after being sent certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case addressed as above
(or to such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to
time). For the purposes of this Agreement, delivery or transmission of (A) a
writing, a copy of a writing, or a physical reproduction, on paper or on
other tangible material, or (B) an email, in each case pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_, constitutes delivery "in writing."

  

 **Section 9.3 Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement,
and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood
that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

 **Section 9.4 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries**.
Except for the Confidentiality Agreement and all documents contemplated
herein to be executed and/or delivered at or in connection with the Merger,
this Agreement (and the schedules and exhibits hereto) constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement, except for the provisions of _Section 6.8_, is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

  

 **Section 9.5 Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial**. (a) THIS
AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS WILL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF WASHINGTON WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. Each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Washington
for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and fully waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such suit, action or

     

   



  

proceeding. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
state or federal court sitting in the State of Washington, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in
any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUITE OR
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

  

 **Section 9.6 Assignment**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

 **Section 9.7 Severability**. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, the parties
will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

  

 **Section 9.8 Enforcement of this Agreement**.  In addition to any remedy
to which any party hereto is specifically entitled by the terms hereof, each
party will be entitled to pursue any other remedy available to it at law or
in equity (including damages, specific performance or other injunctive
relief) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their terms or were otherwise breached; provided
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a termination fee or any expenses
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
payable pursuant to _Section 8.2_, then, subject to _Section 8.2(a)_, such
termination fee or expenses will be the sole remedy with respect to
the failure or failures to perform or other breach or breaches giving rise to
such obligation to pay such termination fee or expenses. The parties hereto
agree that (a) irreparable damage would occur and that the parties hereto
would not have an adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and (b) they will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
this Agreement in any court having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter, subject to _Section 9.5_, in addition to any other remedy to which
they may be entitled at law or in equity.

 **Section 9.9** ** Obligations of Subsidiaries**. Whenever this Agreement
requires any Subsidiary of Buyer or of the Company to take any action, such
requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Buyer or
the Company, as the case may be, to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.

  

 **Section 9.10 Amendment**. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time before or after obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, but if the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
thereafter no amendment will be made which by law requires further approval
by the Companys shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

 **Section 9.11 Extension; Waiver**. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein; provided, however, that such extension or waiver will not operate as
a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

  

 **Section 9.12 Disclosure Schedules**.  The disclosures made on the
Company Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, with respect
to any representation or warranty hereunder, will be deemed to be made with
respect to any other representation or warranty requiring the same or similar
disclosure to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to other
representations and warranties is reasonably evident from the face of such
disclosure. The inclusion of any matter on the Company Disclosure Schedules
and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed an admission by any
party that such matter is material or that such matter has or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company or Buyer, as applicable.

  

 **Section 9.13 Construction**. The table of contents, index of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Words in the singular form will be construed to include the
plural and vice versa, unless the context requires otherwise. Any reference
to the Surviving Corporation or to the Company after giving effect to the
Merger means Buyer as the Surviving Corporation. Any agreement referred to
herein means such agreement as amended, supplemented or modified from time to
time to the extent permitted by the applicable provisions thereof and by this
Agreement.
