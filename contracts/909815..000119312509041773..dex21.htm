to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Share Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated hereby;

and to consummate the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated

WHEREAS, IPC, Amalgamation Sub and Max desire to make certain representations,

to prescribe various conditions to the Amalgamation; and

WHEREAS, it is intended that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE AMALGAMATION

1.1 _The Amalgamation; Effective Time_ _._ Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and the amalgamation agreement attached as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Amalgamation Agreement_ "),    Amalgamation Sub and Max will cause an application for registration of an
amalgamated company (the " _Amalgamation Application_ ") to be prepared,
executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the "
_Registrar_ ") as provided under S.108 of the Companies Act on or prior to the
Closing Date and will cause the Amalgamation to become effective pursuant
to the Companies Act. The Amalgamation shall become effective upon the
issuance of a Certificate of Amalgamation by the Registrar or such other time
as the Certificate of Amalgamation may provide. The parties agree that they
will request the Registrar provide in the Certificate of Amalgamation that
the Effective Time will be the time when the Amalgamation Application is filed
with the Registrar or another time mutually agreed by the parties (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Amalgamation (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is the third
business day after the satisfaction or waiver (if such waiver is permitted and
effective under applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.5(a)) of the latest to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date),
unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad
Street, in New York, NY, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties.

1.3 _Effects of the Amalgamation_ _. _ As of the Effective Time, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, Max
shall be amalgamated with Amalgamation Sub and the amalgamated company (the "
_Amalgamated Company_ ") shall continue after the Amalgamation. The parties
acknowledge and agree that for purposes of Bermuda Law ( _a_ ) the
Amalgamation shall be effected so as to constitute an "amalgamation" in
accordance with S.104 of the Companies Act, and ( _b_ ) the Amalgamated
Company shall be deemed to be an "amalgamated company" as such term is defined
under the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, from and after the Effective
Time: ( _i_ ) the Amalgamation of Max and Amalgamation Sub and their
continuance as one company shall become effective; ( _ii_ ) the property of
each of Max and Amalgamation Sub shall become the property of Amalgamated
Company; ( _iii_ ) Amalgamated Company shall continue to be liable for the
obligations and liabilities of each of Max and Amalgamation Sub; ( _iv_ ) any
existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution shall be
unaffected; ( _v_ ) a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding
pending by or against Max or Amalgamation Sub may be continued to be
prosecuted by or against Amalgamated Company; and ( _vi_ ) a conviction
against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, Max or
Amalgamation Sub may be enforced by or against Amalgamated Company.

1.4 _Amalgamated Company Bye-laws_. The bye-laws of the Amalgamated Company
shall be in a form to be mutually agreed by Max and IPC no later than March
5, 2009 and shall be attached to the Amalgamation Agreement.

1.5  _Directors and Officers of IPC_.

(a) Subject to the Required IPC Vote (as defined in Section 3.10(a)), IPC
shall take all actions necessary so that immediately after the Effective
Time, the board of directors of IPC shall be comprised of the individuals to
be mutually agreed by Max and IPC no later than  



 

2  March 5, 2009 (and by amendment to this Agreement as of such date, to be
identified on _Exhibit B_ , as it may be further amended or modified
from time to time after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by
the mutual written agreement of the parties) to serve as directors of IPC
after the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.1) (the " _Post-Closing
Directors_ ") (six of whom are directors of IPC as of the date hereof, one of
whom is Maxs chief executive officer as of the date hereof and five of whom
are directors of Max as of the date hereof). Such individuals will serve as
directors on the board of directors of IPC until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed. Subject to the Required IPC Vote, IPC shall take all actions
necessary so that immediately after the Effective Time Kenneth L. Hammond (or
his replacement pursuant to the terms of Section 1.5(d)) shall be the chairman
of the board of directors of IPC and an individual to be designated by Max
prior to March 5, 2009 (or his replacement pursuant to the terms of Section
1.5(d)) shall be the deputy chairman of the board of directors of IPC;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the individual who becomes the deputy
chairman immediately after the Effective Time has not otherwise been replaced
as deputy chairman pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.5(a), should the
deputy chairman not be determined to be an "independent director" (within the
meaning of the NASDAQ director independence requirements) by a majority of
the board of directors of IPC within 18 months after the Closing Date, the
board of directors of IPC shall elect a new deputy chairman.

(b) Subject to the Required IPC Vote, IPC shall take all actions reasonably
necessary so that, immediately after the Effective Time, each committee of
IPCs board of directors is composed of the Post-Closing Directors identified
with respect to such committee in _Exhibit B_ (as it may be amended or
modified from time to time after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time by the mutual written agreement of the parties) until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed or such other time that the board of directors of IPC
after the Closing determines to reconstitute or eliminate such committee.

(c) IPC shall take all actions necessary so that immediately after the
Effective Time, the officers of IPC shall be comprised of the
individuals identified in _Exhibit C_ (as it may be amended or modified from
time to time after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by the
mutual written agreement of the parties) until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, should any
of the Post-Closing Directors or officers identified in _Exhibit B_ or
_Exhibit C_ be unwilling or unable to serve in the capacities provided for in
this Section 1.5, then the parties shall cooperate in good faith to designate
a mutually agreeable replacement and to amend _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit C_ , as
the case may be, accordingly.

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Amalgamated Company, Max Bermuda, IPCRe
and Other Subsidiaries_.

(a) IPC and Max shall take all actions necessary so that, immediately after
the Effective Time, the boards of directors of Max Bermuda Ltd. (" _Max
Bermuda_ "), IPCRe Limited (" _IPCRe_ ") and the Amalgamated Company shall be
comprised of individuals to be  



 

3  mutually agreed by Max and IPC no later than March 5, 2009 (and by amendment
to this Agreement as of such date, to be identified on _Exhibit D_ , as it
may be further amended or modified from time to time after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of the parties)
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed. Following the Effective Time, the
boards of directors of each other subsidiary of Max and IPC shall be comprised
of such individuals as are directors of such entities as of the Effective Time
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed.

(b) IPC and Max shall take, and shall cause the Amalgamated Company, Max
Bermuda and IPCRe to take, all actions reasonably necessary so that
immediately after the Effective Time, the officers of Max Bermuda, IPCRe and
the Amalgamated Company shall be comprised of the individuals identified in 
_Exhibit D_ (as it may be amended or modified from time to time after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of the
parties) until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed.

(c) Section 1.5(d) is incorporated by reference herein, _mutatis mutandi_.

 

1.7 _Company Names_. Subject to the Required IPC Vote, IPC and Max shall take
all actions reasonably necessary so that immediately after the Effective
Time:

(a) The name of IPC shall be Max Capital Group Ltd.;

(b) The name of the Amalgamated Company shall be Max Holdings Ltd.; and

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF MAX SECURITIES;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

2.1 _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without
any action on the part of the holder of any common shares in Max, each having
a par value of $1.00 (each, a " _Max Common Share_ "), as evidenced by way of
entry in the register of shareholders of Max (the " _Max Share Register_ ")
or by share certificates registered in the name of a shareholder and
representing outstanding Max Common Shares (each, a " _Max Certificate_ "):

(a) _Conversion of Max Common Shares_. Each Max Common Share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
a fraction of a share in the share capital of IPC, each having a par value of
$0.01 (each, a " _IPC Common Share_ ") equal to 0.6429 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") (the Exchange Ratio, together with any cash paid in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), the " _Amalgamation
Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, each Max Common Share shall be
cancelled and each holder of shares registered in the Max Share Register or
holding a valid Max Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except the
right to receive the  



 

4  Amalgamation Consideration. The Amalgamation Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into IPC Common Shares or Max Common Shares),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to IPC Common Shares or Max Common Shares having a record date on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Cancellation of IPC-Owned Securities_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, all Max Common Shares that are owned by IPC or by
any subsidiary of IPC immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Amalgamation, and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof
and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

(c) _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Max Common Shares held
by a person who did not vote in favor of the Amalgamation and who complies
with all the provisions of the Companies Act concerning the right of holders
of Max Common Shares to require appraisal of their Max Common Shares pursuant
to Bermuda Law (such shareholder, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ", and such
shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Amalgamation Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), but
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the value thereof
as appraised by a court under Section 106 of the Companies Act. In the event
that a Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal, its Max Common Shares shall be
deemed to be cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Amalgamation Consideration for each such Dissenting Share,
without interest. Max shall give IPC ( _i_ ) prompt notice of ( _A_ ) any
written demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such
demands received by Max and ( _B_ ) to the extent that Max has actual
knowledge, any attempted applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for
appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares, and ( _ii_ ) the
opportunity to participate with Max in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. Neither Max nor
IPC shall, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 

2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, IPC shall designate an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Max (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging Max Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to or at the Effective Time, IPC shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this ARTICLE
II, certificates, or at IPCs option, shares in book entry form
representing the IPC Common Shares to be exchanged in the Amalgamation, cash
in an amount sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions to which the
shareholders of Max may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Such
Amalgamation Consideration and cash so deposited are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Max Certificates on cash amounts payable upon the
surrender of such certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2.



 

5 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, IPC or the Amalgamated Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail,
to each shareholder of Max, ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the parties may reasonably
specify) and ( _ii_ ) where applicable, instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Max Certificates, to the extent available and in issue, in
exchange for the Amalgamation Consideration. After the Effective Time, upon
surrender of title to the Max Common Shares previously held by a shareholder
of Max in accordance with this Section 2.2, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed if such shareholder holds Max Certificates, and such
other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, a holder of Max
Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
or book-entry representing that number of whole IPC Common Shares and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares that such shareholder has the right to receive
pursuant to this ARTICLE II, and any Max Certificate surrendered in respect
thereof shall forthwith be marked as cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Max Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of Max, a certificate or book-entry representing the proper number of IPC
Common Shares may be issued to a transferee if the Max Certificate
representing such Max Common Shares (if any) is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.

(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to IPC Common Shares with a
record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to any shareholder of
Max holding any unsurrendered Max Certificate with respect to the IPC Common
Shares represented thereby, nor shall the cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares be paid to any such shareholder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until such
shareholder shall surrender such Max Certificate in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this ARTICLE II. Following the surrender of any such
Max Certificate in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE
II, such shareholder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the
consideration set forth in Section 2.1(a), without interest, ( _i_ ) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore paid (but
withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such
whole IPC Common Shares which a shareholder of Max holding such Max
Certificate is entitled to receive hereunder, and ( _ii_ ) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole IPC Common Shares
which such shareholder is entitled to receive hereunder.

(d) _No Further Rights in Max Common Shares_. All Amalgamation Consideration
paid or issued upon the surrender of title to Max Common Shares in accordance
with the terms of this ARTICLE II (including any cash paid pursuant to this
ARTICLE II) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shareholders of Max, in their
capacity as shareholders of Max prior to the Effective Time. There shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Amalgamated Company of the Max Common Shares which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after  



 

6  the Effective Time, Max Certificates are presented to IPC or to the
Amalgamated Company or to the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
marked as cancelled and exchanged in accordance with this ARTICLE II, except
as otherwise required by Law.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of a IPC Common Share will be issued in connection with
the Amalgamation, and in lieu thereof any shareholder of Max who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a IPC Common Share, shall be
paid upon surrender of title to Max Common Shares for exchange (and after
taking into account and aggregating Max Common Shares represented by all Max
Certificates surrendered by such holder, or as set out in the Max
Share Register, as applicable) cash in an amount (without interest) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying ( _i_ ) the fractional share interest to
which such shareholder (after taking into account and aggregating all Max
Common Shares represented by all Max Certificates surrendered by such
shareholder or as set out in the Max Share Register, as applicable) would
otherwise be entitled by ( _ii_ ) the Average IPC Share Price (as defined in
Section 8.13(a)).

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Max
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions as may be required pursuant to this ARTICLE II in respect of
the Max Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates; _provided_ that IPC may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against IPC
or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Unless a longer period is prescribed by
applicable Law or IPCs agreement with the Exchange Agent, any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders of Max for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to IPC, upon demand, and
any shareholders of Max who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE
II shall thereafter look only to IPC for payment of their claim for the
Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to
IPC Common Shares.

(h) _No Liability_. To the extent allowed under applicable Law, any
Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect
to IPC Common Shares comprising the Amalgamation Consideration that remain
undistributed to the shareholders of Max shall be delivered to and become the
property of IPC on the day immediately prior to the day that such property is
required to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. None of IPC, Amalgamation Sub,
Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder
of Max for any such property delivered to IPC or to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(i) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, IPC and the Amalgamated Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this  



 

7  Agreement to any shareholder of Max such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision
of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent, IPC or the Amalgamated Company, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Max Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. The parties agree to cooperate with each other for purposes of
determining whether any taxes are required to be withheld with respect to the
Amalgamation.

2.3 _Max Equity Awards_.

(a) _Max Stock Options_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and without any action on the part of any holder of any
outstanding option to purchase Max Common Shares under any Max Share Plan (as
defined in Section 3.2(a)), whether vested or unvested, exercisable or
unexercisable (each, a " _Max Share Option_ "), each Max Share Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to
represent a right acquire Max Common Shares and shall be converted into an
option (a " _New Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the terms of the Max Share Plan under which the Max
Share Option was granted and the applicable award agreement thereunder (taking
into account any accelerated vesting thereunder), such number of IPC Common
Shares and at an exercise price per share determined as follows: 

(1) _Number of Shares_. The number of IPC Common Shares subject to a New
Option shall be equal to the product of ( _A_ ) the number of Max Common
Shares subject to such Max Share Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and ( _B_ ) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest whole share; and

(2) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per IPC Common Share purchasable upon
exercise of a New Option shall be equal to ( _A_ ) the per share exercise
price of the Max Share Option divided by ( _B_ ) the Exchange Ratio, the
quotient being rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent.

The foregoing adjustments shall ( _i_ ) in the case of any Max Share Option
that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code, be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code and ( _ii_ ) in the case of any Max Share Option that is
not intended to be an "incentive stock option," be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(b) _Max Other Awards_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding
right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Max Common
Shares or benefits measured by the value of Max Common Shares, and each
outstanding award of any kind consisting of Max Common Shares, in each case
that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under
any Max Share Plan and any other Max Benefit Plan (as defined in Section
8.13(a))), other than Max Share Options (the " _Max Other Awards_ "), shall be
deemed to be converted into the right to  



 

8  acquire or receive benefits measured by the value of (as the case may be)
the number of IPC Common Shares equal to the product (rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Max Common Shares subject
to such Max Other Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective
Time, each such right shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the rights under the relevant Max Share Plan
or other Max Benefit Plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder
(taking into account any accelerated vesting thereunder) immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) _Corporate Actions_. Before the Effective Time, Max, or its board
of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, shall take all action
necessary on its part to give effect to the provisions of Sections 2.3(a) and
(b) and shall take such other actions reasonably requested by IPC to give
effect to the foregoing (including obtaining the consent of the holder of or
amending the terms of any Max Share Options, Max Other Awards or any Max Share
Plan). Max shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, none of Max, IPC, the Amalgamated Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries will be required to deliver Max Common Shares or other
capital stock of Max to any person pursuant to or in settlement of Max Share
Options or Max Other Awards at or after the Effective Time.

(d) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the Max Share Plans or
any other Max Benefit Plan or the IPC Common Shares issuable thereunder is
required under the Securities Act, IPC shall file with the SEC within five
business days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to such interests
of IPC Common Shares, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or the prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as the relevant Max Share Plans or other Max Benefit Plans, as
applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or the
IPC Common Shares issuable thereunder continues to be required.

(e) _Notice to Equity Award Holders_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, IPC shall deliver to the holders of Max Share Options and
Max Other Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to any Max Share Plan or Max Benefit Plan and agreements evidencing
such Max Share Options and Max Other Awards and stating that the Max Share
Plans or Max Benefit Plans and such Max Share Options and Max Other Awards
and agreements have been assumed by IPC and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
2.3 after giving effect to the Amalgamation and the terms of the Max Share
Plans or Max Benefit Plans).

2.4 _Max Warrants_

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding warrant to
purchase Max Common Shares issued pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as
of June 13, 2003 among Max Capital Group Ltd. (f/k/a Max Re Capital Ltd.) and
Moore Holdings, LLC (a true and correct copy of which warrant Max has
provided to IPC prior to the date of this Agreement) or that were issued (in
substantially the form of the warrant filed as Exhibit 4.3 to the Form S-1
Registration Statement filed by Max  



 

9  with the SEC on July 6, 2001) to the other persons listed on Section 2.4 of
the Max Disclosure Letter (all of the outstanding warrants to purchase Max
Common Shares, collectively, the " _Max Warrants_ "), each Max Warrant that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent
a right to acquire Max Common Shares and shall be converted into a
new warrant (a " _New Warrant_ ") to purchase, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the terms of the Max Warrant
under which the Max Warrant was granted, such number of IPC Common Shares and
at an exercise price per share determined as follows:

(i) _Number of Shares_. The number of IPC Common Shares subject to a
New Warrant shall be equal to the product of ( _A_ ) the number of Max Common
Shares subject to such Max Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time and
( _B_ ) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded, if necessary, to
the nearest whole share; and

(ii) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per IPC Common Share purchasable
upon exercise of a New Warrant shall be equal to ( _A_ ) the per share
exercise price of the Max Warrant divided by ( _B_ ) the Exchange Ratio, the
quotient being rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent.

(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the Max Warrants require that Max, prior to the Closing:

(i) make appropriate provisions (in form and substance satisfactory to the Max
Warrant holders) to insure that the Max Warrant holders shall therafter have
the right to acquire and receive, in lieu of Max Common Shares immediately
theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of such Max Warrant,
such IPC Common Shares that such Max Warrant holder would have been
entitled to receive if such Max Warrant holder had exercised the Max Warrant
immediately prior to the Amalgamation;

(ii) make appropriate provisions (in form and substance satisfactory to the
Max Warrant holders) to insure that the provisions of Section 2 of such Max
Warrants shall thereafter be applicable to the New Warrants and that there is
an immediate adjustment of the "Exercise Price" (as defined in such Max
Warrant) to the value for the Max Common Shares reflected by the terms of the
Amalgamation, and a corresponding immediate adjustment in the number of IPC
Common Shares acquirable and receivable upon exercise of the New Warrants, if
the value so reflected is less than the Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to the Amalgamation; and

(iii) use reasonable efforts to cause the Amalgamated Company to assume by
written instrument (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Max
Warrant holders), the obligation to deliver to the Max Warrant holders such
shares, securities or assets as, in accordance with such Max Warrants, that
such New Warrant holders may be entitled to acquire.

respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the

SEC thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and none of its or its
subsidiaries SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial

or assumed, as the case may be, by one of its Insurance Entities (as defined
in Section 3.12(a)) for which adequate claims reserves have been established),
and (iv) liabilities which have not had and would not be reasonably expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, it and
its subsidiaries do not have, and since December 31, 2008, it and its
subsidiaries have not incurred, any liabilities or obligations of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether or
not required to be reflected in its financial statements in accordance with
GAAP).

3.5 _Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements_. Except as
has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect:

(a) It and its subsidiaries hold in full force and effect all permits,
certifications, registrations, permissions, consents, franchises,
concessions, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary for the ownership and
conduct of the business of it and its subsidiaries (including any insurance
licenses or permissions from insurance regulatory authorities) in each of the
jurisdictions in which it or its subsidiaries currently conduct or operate its
business (the " _Permits_ "), and it and its subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms and requirements of its Permits and any applicable law,
statute, ordinance, common law, arbitration award, or any rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, agency requirement or published
interpretation of any Governmental Entity, including all relevant bye-laws
and regulations of the Council and Society of Lloyds incorporated under the
Lloyds Act of 1871 to 1982 of England and Wales (" _Lloyd s_") in each of
the jurisdictions in which it or its subsidiaries currently conduct business
or operate (collectively " _Laws_ "). The businesses of it and its
subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any
applicable Laws (including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended,
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd 1 _et seq_., as amended
(or any other similar applicable foreign, federal, or state legal
requirement), anti-money laundering laws, anti-terrorism laws, all applicable
requirements relating to the sale, issuance, marketing, advertising and
administration of insurance products (including licensing and appointments)
and all Laws regulating the business and products of insurance and all
applicable orders and directives of insurance regulatory authorities (the "
_Insurance Laws_ ") and all applicable laws or other legal requirements
relating to the retention of e-mail and other information). It and its
subsidiaries have not received, at any time since January 1, 2007, any
written notice or communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any
actual, alleged, or potential violation of, or a failure to comply with, any
Laws or the terms and requirements of any Permit or any actual or potential
revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, modification, or termination
of any Permit. All applications required to have been filed for the renewal of
each Permit or other filings required to be made with respect to each Permit
held by it or its subsidiaries have been duly filed on a timely basis with
the appropriate Governmental Entity.



 

15 (b) It has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to it,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to its principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in its periodic reports under the Exchange Act and
ensure that the information required to be disclosed in its SEC Documents is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SECs rules and forms. It and its subsidiaries maintain a
system of internal controls over financial reporting sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The records,
systems, controls, data and information of it and its subsidiaries are
recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including
any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or
not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its
subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) and are held or maintained in such places as may be required under
all applicable Laws (including Insurance Laws). It has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to its
auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect its ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. It has made available to the other party a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to its auditors and audit committee since
January 1, 2007. 

(c) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by it or
any of its subsidiaries to any of its executive officers (as defined in Rule
3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or directors.

(d) Since January 1, 2007, it has complied with the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

(e) Neither it nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among it and any of its subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, it or any of its subsidiaries in the SEC Documents.

3.6 _Legal and Arbitration Proceedings and Investigations_. Except for
litigation or arbitration arising in the ordinary course of business
from claims under Policies or Reinsurance Agreements issued or assumed, as
the case may be, by one of its Insurance Entities for which adequate claims
reserves have been established, there are no claims, suits, actions,
proceedings, arbitrations or other proceedings whether judicial, arbitral or
administrative, civil or criminal  



 

16  (" _Legal Proceedings_ ") pending or, to its knowledge, threatened, against
it or any of its subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or
employee thereof in his or her capacity as such or any person for whom it or
its subsidiaries may be liable or any of their respective properties, that, if
determined or resolved adversely against it, would be reasonably expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, nor are
there any writs, judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator binding upon it or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective assets or properties that would be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
To its knowledge, since January 1, 2007, there have been no formal or informal
SEC inquiries, investigations or subpoenas, other Governmental Entity
inquiries or investigations or internal investigations or material whistle-
blower complaints pending or otherwise threatened involving it or its
subsidiaries or any current or former officer or director thereof in his or
her capacity as such, other than, in each case, those that if determined or
resolved adversely against it would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 _Taxes_.

(a) All material Tax Returns (as defined in Section 8.13(a)) required by
applicable Law to be filed with any Taxing Authority (as defined in Section
8.13(a)) by, or on behalf of, it or any of its subsidiaries have been filed
when due (taking into account extensions of time to file) in accordance with
all applicable Laws, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects. All such Tax Returns have been examined by the
appropriate Taxing Authority or the period for assessment of the Taxes (as

as a material contract pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC that is not already so filed; ( _ii_ ) that limits or purports to limit in
any material respect either the type of business in which it or any of its

so engage in any business; ( _iii_ ) that creates a partnership, joint
venture, strategic alliance or similar arrangement with respect to any of its

indenture, credit agreement, loan agreement, security agreement, guarantee,

in excess of $5,000,000; ( _v_ ) that, individually or together with related
contracts, provides for any acquisition, disposition, lease, license or use

subsidiaries upon notice of 60 days or less; ( _viii_ ) that includes an
indemnification obligation of it or any of its subsidiaries with a maximum
potential liability in excess of $5,000,000; ( _ix_ ) that is an investment
advisory or investment management agreement or arrangement to which it or any
of its subsidiaries is a party or under which any Investment Asset is

aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede its ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or IPCs and its
subsidiaries ability to own and/or to conduct the businesses after the
Closing. Each such contract described in clauses ( _i_ )-( _x_ ) is referred
to herein as a " _Material Contract_ ".

(b) Each Material Contract is, and after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will continue to be, a valid and binding
obligation of it and its subsidiaries (to the extent they are parties thereto
or bound thereby) enforceable against it and, to its knowledge, each other
party thereto, in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect,
and it and each of its subsidiaries (to the extent they are party thereto or
bound thereby) and, to its knowledge, each other party thereto has performed
in all material respects all  



 

27  obligations required to be performed by it under each Material Contract,
except where such failure to be valid and binding or such non-performance has
not had and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither it nor any of its subsidiaries
has received written notice, nor does it have knowledge, of any material
violation or default in respect of any material obligation under (or any

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

(a) It has disclosed its Compensation and Benefits Plans in Section 3.15(a) of
its Disclosure Letter and it has delivered or made available, to the extent
requested, to the other party prior to the date of this Agreement correct and
complete copies of, ( _i_ ) each of its material Compensation and Benefit
Plans (as hereinafter defined), ( _ii_ ) each applicable trust agreement or
other funding arrangement for each such Compensation and Benefit Plan
(including insurance contracts), and all amendments thereto, ( _iii_ ) with
respect to any such Compensation and Benefit Plan that is intended to be tax-
qualified or tax-preferred under applicable Law, any applicable determination
letter issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and any other applicable
determination document issued by any equivalent non-U.S. taxing or regulatory
authority, in each case, confirming the tax-qualified or tax-preferred status
of such Compensation and Benefit Plan, ( _iv_ ) annual reports or returns,
audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations and reports,
and summary annual reports or other reports prepared for any Compensation and
Benefit Plan with respect to the two most recently completed plan years, and

relating to, or change in employee participation in coverage under, any
Compensation and Benefit Plan which would increase the expense of maintaining
such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent
fiscal year.



 

28 (d) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the shareholder
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, the termination of the
employment of any of its or its subsidiaries employees within a specified
time of the Effective Time or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will ( _i_ ) result in any payment (including severance,

or any of its subsidiaries from it or any of its subsidiaries under
any Compensation and Benefit Plan or otherwise, other than by operation of

and Benefit Plan, ( _iii_ ) result in any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefit or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of any such payment or benefit, ( _iv_ ) limit or restrict the
right of it to merge, amend or terminate any Compensation and Benefit Plan or
any related trust, ( _v_ ) cause a trust for any Compensation and Benefit
Plan to be required to be funded, or ( _vi_ ) result in payments under any

of the Code or any equivalent non-U.S. tax Law.

(e) Each of its Compensation and Benefit Plans that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and nothing has
occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. Neither it nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged in
a transaction with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that would
subject it or any of its subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "). Neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries (i) has an "obligation to contribute" (as defined in ERISA

of the Max employees who have waived 50% of their rights to accelerated
vesting of their Max Share Options and Max Other Awards that would otherwise

subsidiaries and there are no representation or certification proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to
its knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed with any labor relations

intends to terminate his or her employment with it or any of its
subsidiaries, ( _iii_ ) to its knowledge, no employee or former employee of it

subsidiaries is (i) owned free and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance

or, to its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its subsidiaries
concerning the ownership, validity, registerability, enforceability,
infringement or use of, or licensed right to use, any Intellectual Property.
To its knowledge, no valid basis exists for any such litigation, opposition,

shareholders of Max at the Max Shareholders Meeting and to the IPC
shareholders at the IPC Shareholders Meeting and, subject to the first
sentence of this paragraph (a), such other matters as IPC and Max elect to
submit to their respective shareholders in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice in connection with their respective annual general meetings,
including the election of directors, the receipt of audited  



 

36  financial statements, the appointment of an auditor and the transaction of
such other further business, if any, as may lawfully be brought before the
meeting (such joint proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and IPC
shall prepare, together with Max, and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be
a part) with respect to the issuance of IPC Common Shares in the Amalgamation
(such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_
"). Each of IPC and Max shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
prepare and file the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 no
later than 30 days following the date of this Agreement. In addition, each of
IPC and Max shall:

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective
by the SEC, to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and to mail the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their respective
shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective. IPC and Max shall, on the same day of receipt thereof (and if not
possible, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof), provide the other
party with copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any
oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
received from the SEC;

(ii) cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and
each party will provide the other party with a copy of all such filings made
with the SEC. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Max or IPC
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the ( _A_ ) Form S-4 will, at
the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and ( _B_ ) Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the
times of the meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with
the Amalgamation, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ that, in each case of (A) and (B),
neither party shall be responsible or liable for any statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the other
party for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein;

(iii) cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty shall be made by
either such party with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by the other party for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy  



 

37  Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4. IPC and Max shall make any necessary
filings with respect to the Amalgamation under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

(iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to take any action required to be
taken under any applicable securities Laws in connection with the
Amalgamation and each party shall furnish all information concerning it and
the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action;

 

(v) advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of the IPC Common Shares issuable in
connection with the Amalgamation for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4; and

(vi) promptly notify the other party if at any time prior to the Effective
Time it discovers any information relating to either of the parties, or their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the shareholders of Max and IPC, to the extent required by
Law.

(b) Max shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within 45 days, following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _Max Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Required Max Vote, _provided_ that the Max Shareholders Meeting shall not
be held prior to the third business day immediately following the last day on
which the holders of Max Common Shares can require appraisal of their Max
Common Shares pursuant to the Companies Act. Subject to Section 5.4, (i) Max
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and secure the
Required Max Vote in accordance with applicable legal requirements and (ii)
the board of directors of Max shall include the Max Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(c) IPC shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within 45 days, following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _IPC Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Required IPC Vote, _provided_ that the IPC Shareholders Meeting shall not
be held prior to the third business day immediately following the last day on
which the holders of Max Common Shares can require appraisal of their Max
Common Shares pursuant to the Companies Act. Subject to Section 5.4, ( _i_ )
IPC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and secure the
Required IPC Vote in accordance with applicable legal requirements and ( _ii_
) the board of directors of IPC shall include the IPC Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.



 

38 (d) Max and IPC shall coordinate and each shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Max Shareholders Meeting and the IPC
Shareholders Meeting to be held on the same date.

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each of Max and IPC shall (and shall cause each of
its subsidiaries to) ( _i_ ) afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of the other party,
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, records and officers and (
_ii_ ) during such period, make available all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 or Section 5.3 to the contrary,
neither party nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
any legally recognized privilege applicable to such information or violate
or contravene any applicable Laws or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement (including any Laws relating to privacy). The
parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply,
including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of certain sensitive material and to ensure compliance with
applicable Law, and, if necessary, restricting review of certain sensitive
material to the receiving partys financial advisors or outside legal counsel.
No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by any party hereunder.

(b) The parties will hold any such information in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated October 23, 2008, between Max and IPC (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and
effect as provided under Section 8.5 up to and until the Closing. The parties
also agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate immediately upon
the Closing.

5.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
cooperate and consult with the other party with respect to, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Amalgamation and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices,
filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
Requisite Regulatory Approvals and all other consents, waivers, licenses,
registrations, orders, approvals, permits, rulings, requests, authorizations
and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or
any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Amalgamation or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

39 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 5.3(a), to the extent
permissible under applicable Laws, each party shall, in connection with the
above referenced efforts to obtain all Requisite Regulatory Approvals and any
other requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated hereby under applicable Laws or any approval of a Governmental
Entity, use its commercially reasonable efforts to ( _i_ ) supply as promptly
as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to applicable Laws or by any Governmental Entity and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods and the receipt of all such consents, waivers,
licenses, registrations, orders, approvals, permits, rulings, requests,
authorizations and clearances under applicable Laws or from such Governmental
Entities as soon as practicable, ( _ii_ ) cooperate in all respects with the
other party in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
any private party, ( _iii_ ) keep the other party apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and
promptly inform the other party of (and upon reasonable request provide copies
of) any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by any private party, in each case
regarding any other transactions contemplated hereby, ( _iv_ ) permit the
other parties, or the other parties legal counsel, to review prior to its
submission any communication given by it to any Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by any private party, with any other person, (
_v_ ) consult with the other party in advance of any meeting, conference,
conference call, discussion or communication with, any such Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by any private party, with any
other person and ( _vi_ ) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity
or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings, conferences, conference calls, discussions and
communications.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of IPC (and its subsidiaries) or Max (and its subsidiaries) (i)
may, without the prior written consent of the other party, consent to, take or
agree or commit to take, any action for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals or (ii) be required to consent to or agree to
any restriction or limitation for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals (including with respect to divesting, selling,
licensing, transferring, holding separate or otherwise disposing of any
business or assets or conducting its (or its subsidiaries) business in any
specified manner), in each case, which would be effective prior to the
Effective Time or which would, after the Effective Time, not be immaterial to
IPC and its subsidiaries taken together (after giving effect to the
Amalgamation).

(d) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Max and IPC shall (
_i_ ) take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure that no takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Amalgamation, this Agreement, or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and ( _ii_ ) if any takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Amalgamation, this Agreement,
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Amalgamation and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

40 (e) Subject to receipt of the Required IPC Vote, IPC shall take such actions
as are necessary to amend its bye-laws to reflect the IPC Bye-Law Amendments.

5.4 _No Change in Recommendation_.

(a) The board of directors of Max shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify (including by amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus), in any manner adverse to IPC, the Max
Recommendation, or publicly propose to, or publicly announce that its board of
directors has resolved to take any such action (any of the foregoing, with
respect to the Max Recommendation, a " _Change in Max Recommendation_ "). The
board of directors of IPC shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify
(including by amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), in any manner adverse to Max, the IPC Recommendation,
or publicly propose to, or publicly announce that its board of directors has
resolved to take any such action (any of the foregoing, with respect to the
IPC Recommendation, a " _Change in IPC Recommendation_ "). 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Required Max Vote, in the case of Max, or the Required
IPC Vote, in the case of IPC, the board of directors of Max or IPC, as the
case may be, may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly announce
that its board of directors has resolved to take any such action) the
Max Recommendation, in the case of Max, or the IPC Recommendation, in the
case of IPC, other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
in Section 5.5(a)) (with respect to which the conditions under which Max may
make a Change of Max Recommendation and IPC may make a Change of IPC
Recommendation are set forth in Section 5.5), if the board of directors of Max
or IPC, as the case may be, after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors, concludes in good faith that such action is reasonably
likely to be required in order for the relevant directors to comply with such
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that no Change in
Max Recommendation or Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, may
be made unless the party seeking to make such Change in Max Recommendation or
Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, ( _i_ ) has not breached in
any material respect its obligations under this Section 5.4, and ( _ii_ ) has
provided a written notice to the other party advising it of its intention to
make a Change in Max Recommendation or a Change in IPC Recommendation, as the
case may be, and such other party does not, within five business days
following its receipt of such notice, agree to make adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement which obviate the need for the Change in Max
Recommendation or the Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, as
determined in good faith by the board of directors of Max or IPC, as the case
may be, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors ( _provided_ that, during such five business day period, the party
seeking to make such Change in Max Recommendation or Change in IPC
Recommendation, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisors to, negotiate in good faith with the other
party (to the extent the other party desires to negotiate) with respect to
any proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either of Max or IPC of its obligation(s) under Section 5.1 to submit
 



 

41  matters to obtain the Required Max Vote at the Max Shareholders Meeting or
the Required IPC Vote at the IPC Shareholders Meeting, as the case may be; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the board of directors of Max (in the case of
a Change in Max Recommendation) or IPC (in the case of a Change in IPC
Recommendation) shall have effected a Change in Max Recommendation or a Change
in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, then in submitting such matters to
the applicable shareholders meeting, the applicable board of directors may
submit such matters without recommendation, in which event the applicable
board of directors shall communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the applicable shareholders in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent it determines after consultation with its legal counsel, that such
action is compelled by applicable Law.

5.5 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Each of Max and IPC agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor
any of the officers and directors of it or its subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall cause (and use commercially reasonable efforts to instruct) its
and its subsidiaries employees, agents, representatives and advisors
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate (including by providing
information) any effort or attempt to make or implement any proposal or offer
with respect to, or a transaction to effect, an amalgamation, merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
it or any of its subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 10% or more of the
consolidated assets (including, without limitation, stock of its subsidiaries)
of it and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or
tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated,
would result in any person (or the shareholders of such person) beneficially
owning securities representing 10% or more of its total voting power (or of
the surviving IPC entity in such transaction) or the voting power of any of
its subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a
proposal or offer made by the other party to this Agreement) being hereinafter
referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ");

(ii) have, participate or otherwise engage in any discussions or
negotiations with or provide any confidential information or data to any
person relating to an Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement; or

(iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
amalgamation agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal.



 

42 (b) Each of Max and IPC agrees that ( _i_ ) it shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (
_ii_ ) it shall not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of Max
and IPC agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly inform its and its subsidiaries respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 5.5.

(c) Each of Max and IPC shall promptly notify the other party of any (i)
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request for information that could reasonably be
expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal received by it, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives or advisors (including any investment bankers,
attorneys or accountants), and (iii) request that could reasonably be expected
to be related to an Acquisition Proposal for discussions with or negotiations
by, it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors (including any
investment bankers, attorneys or accountants), indicating, in connection with
such notice, the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal
or request and the material terms and conditions thereof (including a copy
thereof and any related available documentation and correspondence), and in
any event Max or IPC, as the case may be, shall provide written notice to the
other party of any Acquisition Proposal, request for information or request
for such discussions or negotiations within 24 hours of such event. Max or
IPC, as the case may be, will (A) inform the person making such Acquisition
Proposal, request for information or request for discussions or negotiations
of its obligations under this Agreement and (B) keep the other party
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or request for information or request for discussions or
negotiations (including whether such Acquisition Proposal or request for
information or request for discussions or negotiations is withdrawn and any
material change to the terms thereof).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the Required Max Vote, in the case of Max, or
the Required IPC Vote, in the case of IPC (in each case, after the expiration
of the Notice Period (as hereinafter defined)), the board of directors of Max
or IPC, as the case may be, concludes that an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5
could be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal (after giving
effect to all the adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by the
other party prior to or during the Notice Period), the board of directors of
Max or IPC, as the case may be, may make a Change in Max Recommendation or a
Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be; _provided_ that the board of
directors of Max or IPC, as the case may be, may not make a Change in Max
Recommendation or a Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, unless (
_i_ ) the party seeking to take such actions has provided a written notice to
the other party (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising such other
party that it has received an Acquisition Proposal that could be reasonably
likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and specifying the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof
(including a copy thereof and any related available documentation and
correspondence) and ( _ii_ ) such other party does not, within five business
days following its receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the  



 

43  " _Notice Period_ "), make an offer that, as determined in good faith by the
board of directors of Max or IPC, as the case may be, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, results in the applicable
Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that,
during the Notice Period, Max or IPC, as the case may be, shall, and
shall cause its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors to,
negotiate in good faith with IPC or Max, as the case may be (to the extent
such other party desires to negotiate) with respect to such proposal). The
parties understand and agree that to comply with this Section 5.5(d) any
revisions to the terms of such Superior Proposal which, individually or in the
aggregate would be material when considering such Superior Proposal in its
totality, shall require the party seeking to make a Change in Max
Recommendation or a Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be, to
deliver to the other party a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
commencement of a new Notice Period.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit Max or IPC, as the
case may be, from ( _i_ ) complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent applicable with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_ that, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal made by way
of a tender offer or exchange offer, any failure by Max or IPC, as the
case may be, or its board of directors to recommend that the shareholders of
Max or IPC, as the case may be, reject such offer within the time period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to be a Change in Max
Recommendation or Change in IPC Recommendation, as the case may be), or
making any legally required disclosure to its shareholders with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that any disclosure (other than a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) shall
be deemed to be a Change in Max Recommendation, or Change in IPC
Recommendation, as the case may be, unless the board of directors of Max or
IPC, as the case may be, expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its
shareholders in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby) or ( _ii_ ) informing any person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.5.

(f) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal from any person (other than the other party or its subsidiaries)
that did not result from a breach by Max or IPC, as the case may be, of this
Section 5.5, which the board of directors of Max or IPC, as the case may be,
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, taking into account the legal, financial,
regulatory, timing and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the
person making the Acquisition Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) is in the long-term
best interests of Max or IPC, as the case may be, including its shareholders,
employees, communities and other stakeholders, taking into account the long-
term strategic prospects and other benefits of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the fact that neither Max nor IPC has been soliciting a
transaction that would result in a sale of Max or IPC, as the case may be, or
is otherwise pursuing any other Acquisition Proposal, and ( _i_ ) is more
favorable to Max or IPC, as applicable, its shareholders and other
constituencies than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
giving effect to all adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by
the other party under Section 5.5(d) in response to such Acquisition
Proposal), ( _ii_ ) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully
financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals
and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed and
( _iii_ ) that could be reasonably likely to  



 

44  require the board of directors of Max to make a Change in Max Recommendation
or the board of directors of IPC to make a Change in IPC Recommendation, as
the case may be, in order to comply with its directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of
"Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.5(a)(i), except that the reference
to "10% or more of its voting power or the voting power of any of its
subsidiaries" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to
be a reference to "50% or more of its total voting power or the voting power
of any of its subsidiaries" and the reference to "10% or more of the
consolidated assets" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall
be deemed to be a reference to "all or substantially all of the consolidated
assets."

5.6 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Max and IPC
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be exempt under Rule
16b -3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Max Common
Shares or acquisitions of IPC Common Shares (including, in each case,
derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by
(i) each director or officer of Max who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Max
and (ii) any director or officer of IPC who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

5.7  _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Amalgamation is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except as otherwise provided herein, and except that expenses
incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally by IPC and Max.

5.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, IPC shall cause the Amalgamated Company
to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (and, in the case of
former officers and directors, to the extent permitted by the bye-laws of Max
and the Amalgamated Company prior to the Closing), indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of Max (the " _Indemnified Parties_
") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on
or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of Max or any of its respective subsidiaries, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by Max or any of its respective subsidiaries pursuant
to the relevant entitys memorandum of association, bye-laws and
indemnification agreements and resolutions, if any, in existence on the date
hereof.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, IPC shall purchase as
of the Effective Time, a tail policy to the existing directors and officers
liability insurance  



 

45  maintained by each of Max and IPC with respect to claims arising from facts
or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, and which tail
policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the
coverage provided by the existing policy providing the greatest coverage (as
between IPC and Max) as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall IPC be required to expend for the entire tail policy,
in excess of 350% of the annual premium currently provided by Max or IPC, as
the case may be, for their respective existing policies of directors and
officers liability insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, IPC shall be obliged
to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not to
exceed such amount. At the request of IPC, Max shall cooperate with IPC to
obtain such a tail policy effective as of the Effective Time.

(c) In the event that IPC or the Amalgamated Company or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other
person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or amalgamation or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person (including by
dissolution), then, and in each such case, IPC shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of IPC or the Amalgamated
Company assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, IPC shall enter into customary
director indemnification agreements with each Post-Closing Director pursuant
to which IPC will agree, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses
to, each such individual against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Post-Closing Director is or was a director or officer of IPC or any of its
subsidiaries (including Max and its subsidiaries).

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.8: ( _i_ ) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and legal representatives and ( _ii_ ) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

5.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Amalgamation shall be a joint press release and thereafter each of Max and IPC
shall, except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of NASDAQ or by request of
any Governmental Entity, consult with the other party before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this consultation obligation shall not apply to any press release or
other public statement relating to any actual or contemplated litigation
between the parties to this Agreement.

5.10 _Additional Agreements_. In case any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Amalgamated Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, permits, authorizations, immunities and franchises of Max and its
subsidiaries, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective officers and directors to take all such necessary action.



 

46 5.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. Max shall give IPC the reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of any shareholder litigation against Max or
its directors or officers relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and IPC shall give Max the reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of any shareholder litigation against IPC or its
directors or officers relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

5.12 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Prior to Closing, Max shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have
the individuals listed on Section 5.12(a) of the Max Disclosure Schedule
waive 50% of their rights to accelerated vesting of their Max Share Options
and Max Other Awards that would otherwise vest in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement. Max shall not provide
any remuneration to the individuals listed on Section 5.12(a) of the Max
Disclosure Letter in exchange for the waiver contemplated by this Section
5.12(a).

(b) As of the Closing Date, IPC shall, or shall cause one of its subsidiaries
to, continue to employ each person employed by IPC or Max or any of their
respective subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (such employees, collectively,
the " _Employees_ "). Except as expressly provided below, nothing contained
herein shall restrict IPC in the future in the exercise of its independent,
good-faith business judgment as to the terms and conditions under which such
employment shall continue, the duration of such employment, the basis on which
such employment is terminated or the benefits provided to any Employee.

(c) For a period of not less than one year following the Closing Date, IPC
shall (or shall cause its subsidiaries to) make available ( _i_ ) to the
Employees that immediately prior to the Closing were employed by Max,
employee benefits and compensation opportunities (including salary, wages and
bonus opportunity) substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee
benefits and compensation opportunities in effect for Max employees
immediately prior to the Closing and ( _ii_ ) to the Employees that
immediately prior to the Closing were employed by IPC, employee benefits and
compensation opportunities (including salary, wages and bonus opportunity)
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities in effect for IPC employees immediately prior to
the Closing.

(d) IPC and its subsidiaries shall ensure that any Compensation and Benefit
Plan in which the Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing Date
shall take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder,
except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or
to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by the
Employees with IPC and any of its subsidiaries or Max and any of its
subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent
such service was credited prior to the Closing Date under a comparable
Compensation and Benefit Plan of IPC or Max, as applicable.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, IPC shall honor all Max Benefit Plans and
IPC Benefit Plans, in each case in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Closing Date; _provided_ that nothing herein shall
limit the right of IPC to amend or terminate any such plan in accordance with
its terms.



 

47 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (ii) give any third party
any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.12.

5.13 _NASDAQ Listing and Delisting; Reservation for Issuance_. IPC shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all the following shares to be
approved for listing and quotation on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject
to official notice of issuance, no later than the Closing Date: ( _i_ ) all
IPC Common Shares to be issued in the Amalgamation to Max shareholders and (
_ii_ ) all IPC Common Shares to be reserved for issuance upon exercise or
vesting of the Max Share Options, Max Other Awards or the Max Warrants
(collectively, the " _Listed IPC Common Shares_ "). IPC shall take all action
necessary to reserve for issuance, prior to the Closing Date, any Listed IPC
Common Shares that, by their terms and in accordance with this Agreement,
will not be issued until after the Effective Time. IPC shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Max Common Shares to no longer be
listed or quoted on NASDAQ and to be deregistered under the Exchange Act as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

5.14 _Dividends_. IPC and Max shall coordinate the declaration, setting of
record dates and payment dates of dividends of IPC Common Shares and Max
Common Shares so that holders of Max Common Shares do not receive dividends on
both Max Common Shares and the IPC Common Shares received in the Amalgamation
in respect of any calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend on either
the Max Common Shares or the IPC Common Shares received in the Amalgamation in
respect of any calendar quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of
this Section 5.14 is to ensure that the holders of the Max Common Shares and
IPC Common Shares each receive the same number of quarterly dividends after
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time with respect to
such shares.

5.15 _Tax Treatment_.

(a) The parties intend the Amalgamation to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the opinions described
in Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(e) of this Agreement. Each of IPC, Amalgamation Sub
and Max and each of their respective affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Amalgamation to so qualify and to obtain such
opinions, and unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by any other
provision of this Agreement, shall not take any actions, or cause any actions
to be taken, which would reasonably be expected to cause the Amalgamation to
fail so to qualify or the opinions to fail to be delivered.

(b) IPC shall cause (i) Amalgamation Sub to file with the United States
Internal Revenue Service a properly completed Form 8832, so as to elect to be
treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes effective at
least one day prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the Amalgamated Company to
file, after the Closing Date, with the United States Internal Revenue Service
a properly completed Form 8832, so as to cause it to be treated for
U.S. federal tax purposes as a disregarded entity effective as of the Closing
Date.



 

48 5.16 _Book Value Calculations_.

(a) On the first business day after the date of its shareholder meeting held
pursuant to Section 5.1, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1, either Max or IPC (the " _Requesting Party_ ") may request, by
providing notice in writing delivered to the other party (the " _Non-
Requesting Party_ "), that the Non-Requesting Party prepare an estimate of
the Non-Requesting Partys book value as of the date that is one (1) business
day prior to such shareholder meeting (such date, the " _Measurement Date_ ",
and such estimate of book value, a " _Book Value Estimate_ ").

(b) If a Requesting Party makes a request pursuant to Section 5.16(a), then
both the Requesting Party and the Non-Requesting Party shall each promptly,
and in any event within five (5) calendar days, prepare Book Value Estimates
and provide such Book Value Estimates, together with reasonable supporting
analysis, to each other. If the Requesting Party fails to provide such Book
Value Estimate within such five (5) calendar day period, then the Requesting
Party shall have no further rights under this Section 5.16 or Sections 7.2(h)
or 7.2(i), as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereby
agree that, if either party requests a Book Value Estimate, the Closing Date
shall not occur until the agreements and covenants set forth in this Section
5.16 have been satisfied or waived.

(c) From and after the time that the Book Value Estimates have both been
delivered, each party shall have five (5) calendar days to review the
other partys Book Value Estimate and supporting analysis and such other
information as the party may reasonably request in connection with its review
of the other partys Book Value Estimate. The parties understand and agree
that no reserve development occurring from and after the Measurement Date
shall increase or reduce either partys Book Value Estimate.

(d) If either partys Book Value Estimate indicates that such party has
experienced a decline in book value of more than 50% from December 31, 2008 to
the Measurement Date (a " _50% Book Value Decline_ "), then the other party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 7.1(h) or Section 7.1(i), as appropriate.

(e) If the parties Book Value Estimates indicate that the percentage decline
in either partys book value from December 31, 2008 to the Measurement Date is
more than 20 percentage points greater than the percentage decline of the
other partys book value from December 31, 2008 to the Measurement Date (a "
_20% Differential Book Value Decline_ "), then the party with the lesser
decline in book value over such period shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(h) or Section
7.1(i), as appropriate; _provided_ that, for purposes of measuring the 20%
Differential Book Value Decline, if any, the book value of any party that
has experienced an increase in book value from December 31, 2008 to the
Measurement Date shall be deemed to have experienced no change in its book
value. Set forth on _Exhibit G_ are illustrative examples of the calculations
provided for in this Section 5.16.

(f) If, after complying with this Section 5.16, neither party has experienced
a 50% Book Value Decline or a 20% Differential Book Value Decline, then (i)
in accordance with the terms this Agreement, each party shall cooperate and
consult with the other party with respect  



 

49  to, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable and (ii) if all other conditions to Closing set forth
in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied
on the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived as of the third business
day after the condition in Section 6.1(a) was satisfied, then notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a) (as the case may be) or
any other provision of this Agreement, no representations or warranties of the
Non-Requesting Party set forth in this Agreement need be true and correct as
of any date after the third business day after the date on which the
condition in Section 6.1(a) was satisfied and any certificate of the Non-
Requesting Party delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c) or Section 6.3(c) (as
the case may be) shall reflect the foregoing.

they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be

meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") means the

8.3 of the Max Disclosure Letter or the officers of IPC set forth in Section
8.3 of the IPC Disclosure Letter, as the case may be. References to "US
dollar," "dollars," "US$" or "$" in this Agreement are to the lawful currency
of the United States of America. As used in this Agreement, "business day"
means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking
institutions in New York or Bermuda are obligated by Law or executive order

8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when each of the parties has delivered a signed counterpart to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Such counterpart executions may be transmitted to the parties by
facsimile or electronic transmission, which shall have the full force and
effect of an original signature.

8.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Max Disclosure Letter and the IPC Disclosure Letter) ( _a_ )
constitutes the entire agreement and  



 

57  supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and shall terminate in accordance with its terms, or if the
Closing occurs, as set forth in Section 5.2(b) and ( _b_ ) is not intended to
confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies
hereunder, except (i) for the rights of the holders of Max Common Shares to
receive the Amalgamation Consideration pursuant to and subject to this
Agreement if the Effective Time occurs, and ( _ii_ ) as provided in Section
5.8(c).

8.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects,
including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of Bermuda,
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws.

8.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless
the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the parties
from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Amalgamation
that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid
or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other parties, which may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion
of the other parties. Any attempt to make any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

8.9 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that money damages would be both
incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the discretion
of the Chosen Court (as defined in Section 8.10), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court identified in Section 8.10, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

8.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
consents, agrees and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bermuda
Supreme Court (and appropriate appellate courts therefrom) (the " _Chosen
Courts_ "), for the purposes of any litigation, action, suit or other
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to commence any litigation,
action, suit or proceeding relating hereto only in the Bermuda Supreme Court,
or if such litigation, action, suit or other proceeding may not be brought in
such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in the other appellate
courts therefrom or other courts of Bermuda. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives  



 

58  any objection to the laying of venue of any litigation, action, suit or
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in the Chosen Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to and
grants any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the
extent legally effective, over the subject matter of any such dispute and
agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

8.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Amalgamation by the shareholders of Max or of IPC, but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by
such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties by their duly authorized representatives.

8.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any
subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder.
