the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the

(c) The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable

(a) At the Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(i) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.2(a)(ii) and any Dissenting Shares), including all vested or unvested
restricted Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
an amount equal to $29.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof (assuming vesting in
full, for this purpose, as applicable) upon surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.3 (the
Shares so converted are hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Shares_ ");
and, as of the Effective Time, all Merger Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to

and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and 

(iii) each Merger Sub Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and any other dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of the Shares the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other dependent
item, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 2.2(b).



 

8 Section 2.3 _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall irrevocably deposit or

of Merger Shares, cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time plus cash to pay for Company Restricted Stock Units and
Company Options pursuant to Section 2.6. Pending distribution pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) or Section 2.6(a) of the cash deposited with the Disbursing
Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Merger Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options and such
cash shall not be used for any other purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash, provided that such
investments (i) shall be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from

of domestic commercial banks with capital exceeding $500,000,000 (collectively
" _Permitted Investments_ ") or in money market funds that are invested solely
in Permitted Investments and (ii) shall have maturities that will not prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or Section 2.6(a).
Each holder of a certificate or certificates representing Merger Shares
canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i)
may thereafter in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3(b), surrender
such certificate or certificates to the Disbursing Agent, as agent for such
holder of Merger Shares, to effect the exchange of such certificate or
certificates on such holders behalf for a period ending twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Disbursing Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Merger Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
representing Merger Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates
to the Disbursing Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement as the Surviving Corporation
may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
certificates representing Merger Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate or certificates representing
Merger Shares for cancellation to the Disbursing Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed, the holder of
such certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (and Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent to pay) the Merger
Consideration for each Merger Share formerly represented by such certificate
or certificates, and the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled, less any amounts required to be withheld by applicable
Law. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such certificate shall, after
the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash or other
consideration or payment of any kind shall be paid to the holder of such
outstanding certificate in respect thereof.



 

9 (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger Shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Merger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, certificates representing Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article II.

(e) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent for purposes of payment in
exchange for Merger Shares remains unclaimed twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, such cash, together with all interest and earnings thereon
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not surrendered its certificate or certificates representing
Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable unclaimed property Laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares six (6) years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration, together with all interest and
earnings thereon made available to the Disbursing Agent pursuant to Section
2.5 to pay for Merger Shares for which dissenters rights have been perfected
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate for Merger Shares.

(h) In the event that any certificate representing Merger Shares shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such certificate representing Merger Shares to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such holder of a bond in such



 

10 reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate
representing Merger Shares, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate representing Merger Shares the
Merger Consideration, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Merger Shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger.

Section 2.4 _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the record holder of the
certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented all
the outstanding Merger Sub Common Shares that were converted into the right
to receive shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with Section 2.2(a)(iii), in exchange for such certificates, duly endorsed in
blank, share certificates, registered in the name of such record
holder, representing the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation to which such record holder is so entitled by virtue of Section
2.2(a)(iii). Such certificate shall bear a legend restricting the
transferability of such shares to the extent necessary to ensure that such
shares will not be offered or sold in contravention of any Federal or state
securities Laws.

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.2, any Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted such Shares in favor of the Merger and who
has delivered a written demand for relief as a dissenting stockholder in the
manner provided by the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to relief as a dissenting
stockholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The holder of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any such holder of Dissenting Shares (i) shall have failed to
establish its entitlement to relief as a dissenting stockholder as provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for
relief as a dissenting stockholder with respect to such Shares or lost its
right to relief as a dissenting stockholder and payment for its Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL, or (iii) shall have failed to file a complaint with
the appropriate court seeking relief as to determination of the value of all
Dissenting Shares within the time provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such
holder shall forfeit the right to relief as a dissenting stockholder with
respect to such Shares and each such Share shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, from the
Surviving Corporation as provided in Section 2.2. The Company shall give
Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
relief as a dissenting stockholder and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Section 2.6 _Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent,



 

11 Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any Shares or any Company Options,
each Company Option shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the
product of (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option (assuming
full vesting of such Company Option) and (ii) the Merger Consideration _over_
(B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option, without interest and
less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable
Law. Each vested and unvested restricted stock unit outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Stock
Units_ ") shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without further action of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of such Company Restricted Stock
Units, vest and become free of all restrictions immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall be canceled, retired and shall cease to exist and
shall be converted into the right to receive, in respect of each underlying
share of Common Stock, the Merger Consideration. All payments with respect to
canceled Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units shall be made by
the Disbursing Agent (and Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent to make
such payments) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
from funds deposited by or at the direction of Parent to pay such amounts in
accordance with Section 2.3(a). All unexercised Company Options as of the
Effective Time that have a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the
Merger Consideration shall be immediately canceled and forfeited without any
liability on the part of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All Company Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the
provisions in any Company Option Plan or any other plan providing for
the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any
interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of
the Effective Time, and the Company shall take such action to ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Option or any participant
in any Company Option Plan or any other plan shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or
any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Disbursing Agent to mail to each holder of a Company Option or
Company Restricted Stock Unit a letter of transmittal and instructions for use
in obtaining the value of the Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit
as contemplated by Section 2.6(a).

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts to be paid hereunder in respect of Company Options
and the Company Restricted Stock Units any amounts required to be deducted and
withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the holders of the Company Options from whose payments in respect
of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units the amounts were so
deducted and withheld.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may
be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any 



 

12 dispositions of Common Stock (including, in each case, derivative securities)
resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. As of the date

applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

of its Subsidiaries, or any amendment of any material term of any outstanding
security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

(ii) any (A) incurrence of, (B) guarantee with respect to, or (C) provision of

with respect to employees who are not officers or directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, increases in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices and that in the aggregate have not resulted in
a material increase in the benefits or compensation expense of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; 



 

19 (iv) any material reduction in any cash or short-term investments or their
equivalent, other than to meet cash needs arising in the ordinary course of
business, generally consistent with past practices;

Section 6.4  _Other Potential Acquirers_.

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 12:01 a.m. (EST) on the twenty first (21st) Business Day after the date
of this Agreement (the " _Exclusivity Period Start Date_ "), the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and other representatives (such Persons, together with the
Subsidiaries of the Company, collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ")
shall have the right (acting under the direction of the Independent Committee)
to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Third Party Acquisition proposals,
including by way of providing access to non-public information pursuant to
(but only pursuant to) a customary confidentiality agreement (which, except
for any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date hereof,
expressly permits the Company to fulfill its obligations set forth in the
penultimate sentence in Section 6.4(b)); _provided_ , that the Company shall
promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries made available to any
Person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent and
Merger Sub; and (ii) maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with
respect to Third Party Acquisition proposals or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations.

(b) From the Exclusivity Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, the
Company shall not, and shall not direct, authorize or permit any of the
Company Representatives to, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit,
initiate, or engage in discussions or negotiations with or



 

33 provide any non-public information to any Person or group of related Persons
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or any
designees of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates), or take any
action designed to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal with
respect to, any Third Party Acquisition, except as may relate to any Person
or group of related Persons from whom the Company has received, prior to the
Exclusivity Period Start Date, a written expression of interest that the
Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as
applicable, determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) is bona fide and that there
is a reasonable prospect that such expression will result in a Superior
Proposal from such Person or group (each such Person or group, an " _Excluded
Party_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section
6.4(b) shall prevent the Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of
the Company, as applicable, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position as required by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to any tender or exchange offer, provided, that
such disclosure states that no action will be taken by the Independent
Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company or any other committee
thereof, as applicable, in violation of this Section 6.4, or from making any
other disclosure required by applicable Law; and (ii) if it receives a
written unsolicited expression of interest from a Person relating to the
submission by such Person of a Third Party Acquisition proposal, supplying to
and receiving non-public information from such Person (subject to a customary
confidentiality agreement that, except for any confidentiality agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof, expressly permits the Company to
fulfill its obligations set forth in the penultimate sentence of this Section
6.4(b)) and conducting such discussions and negotiations with such Person
concerning such expression, in response to such expression as, and to the
extent, the Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as
applicable, determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, (A) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) that
there is a reasonable prospect that such expression will result in a Superior
Proposal from such Person. Except as may relate to an Excluded Party, on the
Exclusivity Period Start Date, the Company shall immediately terminate any
pending discussion regarding any Third Party Acquisition (other than
with Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or any designees of
Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates). From the Exclusivity
Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article X, the Company shall promptly
notify, to the extent the Company is able to do so without breaching any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date hereof, Parent and
Merger Sub of (i) any inquiries or proposals received by, any non-public
information requested from, or any negotiations or discussions sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives from a Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective representatives and Affiliates) with respect to a Third Party
Acquisition, and (ii) the terms thereof, including the identity of such third
party and the general terms of any financing arrangement or commitment in
connection with such Third Party Acquisition, and the Company agrees to
promptly update Parent and Merger Sub on an ongoing basis of the status
thereof, including furnishing copies of any such written inquiries or offers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company (A)
shall



 

34 not, and shall not permit any of the Company Representatives to, provide any
non-public information to any Excluded Party unless pursuant to (but only
pursuant to) a customary confidentiality agreement (which, except for any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date hereof, expressly
permits the Company to fulfill its obligations set forth in the penultimate
sentence in this Section 6.4(b)) and (B) will promptly make available to
Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, any material non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries made available to any Excluded Party that was not
previously made available to Parent and Merger Sub.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(c), neither the Independent
Committee nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall withdraw or modify
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or approve or recommend, or cause or allow
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement with
respect to, any Third Party Acquisition. If the Independent Committee or the
Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, determines in its good
faith judgment after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, may, in the event that it receives a Superior
Proposal and in response thereto, (x) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose
to withdraw or modify, its recommendation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (y) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal but, in each case,
only after (i) providing written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Independent Committee or the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, has received a Superior Proposal
and, to the extent the Company is able to do so without breaching any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date hereof, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying
the Person making such Superior Proposal, and (ii) the Independent Committee
or the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that any transaction proposed by Parent and Merger Sub is
not at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as the Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) no action specified in clause (x)
(other than publicly proposing to withdraw or modify a recommendation) or (y)
above shall be taken until the third (3rd) Business Day after receipt of a
Notice of Superior Proposal by Parent (or, solely in the case of a termination
of this Agreement prior to July 20, 2006 as provided in Section 10.2(a), no
such action shall be taken until two (2) full hours have elapsed after
Parents receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal), and (II) the Company shall
not be entitled to enter into any agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal unless and until this Agreement is terminated by its terms pursuant
to Section 10.1. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position as required by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any tender
or exchange offer, provided, that such disclosure states that no action will
be taken by the Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company in violation of this Section 6.4, or from making any other disclosure
required by applicable Law or the Companys stock exchange or interdealer
quotation system listing agreement, or (ii) disclosing the fact that the
Independent Committee or the Board of



 

35 Directors, as applicable, has received a proposal for a Third Party
Acquisition and the terms of such proposal, if the Independent Committee or
the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it is compelled to make such
disclosure in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
or with obligations under Federal securities Laws or the Companys stock
exchange or interdealer quotation system listing agreement.

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written unsolicited proposal
or solicited in accordance with this Section 6.4, to acquire, by merger or
otherwise, directly or indirectly more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares
then outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and otherwise on terms and conditions that
the Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as
applicable, determines in its good faith judgment (after receipt of advice
from its financial advisor and consultation with outside legal counsel)
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and any
alternative transaction proposal made by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 6.4(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that such proposal or offer shall not
be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal" unless the Independent Committee or the
Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, determines that such
proposal is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms
and that any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by
such proposal or offer is capable of being, and is reasonably likely to be,
obtained.

(ii) " _Third Party Acquisition_ " means the occurrence of any of
the following events: (i) the acquisition of the Company by merger or
otherwise by any Person (which includes a "person" as such term is defined in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent or Merger Sub (a "
_Third Party_ "); (ii) the acquisition by a Third Party of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole; (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of twenty percent (20%) or more
of the outstanding Common Stock or the issuance by the Company of capital
stock containing terms which are inconsistent with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) the adoption by the Company
of a plan of liquidation or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary
dividend; (v) the repurchase by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of more
than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding Shares; or (vi) the acquisition
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by merger, joint venture or
otherwise of any Person, or any purchase of stock or assets or acquisition of
any direct or indirect ownership interest or investment in any business such
that, after such acquisition, the Company and its Subsidiaries interest or
investment in such businesss annual revenues, net income or assets is greater
than or equal to twenty percent (20%) of the annual revenues, net income or
assets of the Company.



 

36 Section 6.5 _Resignation of Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of all directors of the Company and, as specified by Parent
reasonably in advance of the Closing, all directors of the Companys
Subsidiaries, in each case, effective as of the Effective Time.

Section 6.6 _WARN Act_. The Company shall not, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, without the written consent of Parent and without complying
fully with the notice and other requirements of the WARN Act, effectuate (1) a
"plant closing" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of employment or
one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of
the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (2) a "mass layoff" as defined in the WARN
Act affecting any site of employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries; or
(3) any similar action under applicable state or foreign Law requiring notice
to employees in the event of a plant closing or layoff.

ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Section 7.1 _Voting of Shares_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to vote
all Shares beneficially owned by it, and to cause all Shares beneficially
owned by any of their respective Affiliates that are (i) controlled by
Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) members of the Companys Board of Directors to
be voted, in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

Section 7.2 _Director and Officer Liability_. The Surviving Corporation shall
honor all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the
present and former officers and directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at
the Effective Time to the extent provided under the DGCL, the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof or any
indemnification agreements in effect on the date hereof, and such obligations
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from
the Effective Time until the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation with respect to any claims against such directors or officers
arising out of such acts or omissions. Any determination required to be made
with respect to whether the conduct of an individual seeking indemnification
has complied with the standards set forth under applicable Law shall be made
by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and
such individual. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained the current policies of
officers and directors liability insurance maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions that are
no less favorable. Parent shall guarantee, and be jointly and severally
liable for, the obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
Section 7.2. For the avoidance of doubt, such Parent guarantee shall only be
effective if the Closing occurs. This Section 7.2 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, present or former directors or



 

37 officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and
personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. The agreements and
covenants contained in this Section 7.2 shall not be deemed to be exclusive of
any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees,
it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 7.2 is not in substitution for any such claims under any such
policies. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii)
transfers or conveys substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each case to the extent reasonably necessary, proper
actions shall be taken so that the applicable successor or assign assumes the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.2.

ARTICLE VIII

Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty

amounts or if Parent and Merger Sub have provided adequate assurance of
repayment; and (b) refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action
which would impair such partys ability to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action necessary or
desirable so that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, take
all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Consents and Approvals_. The parties shall cooperate with one
another in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this



 

38  Agreement, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, will, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries, if any,

order of, or any exemption by, (i) any Governmental Authority or, (ii) where
the absence of the same would have a Material Adverse Effect, any private
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any
fee, penalty or other consideration to obtain any consent, approval or waiver
required for the consummation of the Merger under any Contract other than _de
minimis_ amounts or if Parent and Merger Sub have provided adequate assurance

arrangements) and (ii) with respect to other Contracts are set forth on

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC and to cause
the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, all
as promptly as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the filing
of the Company Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, the Company shall
consult with Parent with respect to such filings and shall afford Parent or
its representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Parent shall
provide the Company with any information for inclusion in the Company Proxy
Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 which may be required under applicable Law
and which is reasonably requested by the Company. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of the receipt of comments of the SEC and of any request from
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Company Proxy Statement or the
Schedule 13E-3 or for additional information, and will promptly supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or its representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the Merger. If
at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any event should occur
which is required by applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Company Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, the Company
will promptly inform Parent. In such case, the Company, with the cooperation
of Parent, will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare and mail such
amendment or supplement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to such
mailing, the Company shall consult with Parent with



 

39 respect to such amendment or supplement and shall afford Parent or its
representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. The Company will
notify Parent at least 48 hours prior to the mailing of the Company Proxy
Statement, or 24 hours prior to the mailing of any amendment or supplement
thereto, to the stockholders of the Company.

(c) _Provided Information_. The information supplied by each of the Company
and Parent for inclusion in any filing with the SEC, including, but
not limited to, the Company Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, shall
not, in the case of the Schedule 13E-3 as of the date thereof, the date of any
amendment thereto, and as of the Effective Time, and in the case of the
Company Proxy Statement, as of the time the Company Proxy Statement (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders
of the Company, as of the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or as of
the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

reasonable best efforts to file as soon as practicable (but, in any event, no
more than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof) notifications under
the HSR Act and to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
received from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the

reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, its officers, employees,
representatives and advisors (including legal and accounting) to provide, at
Parents expense, such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Merger
Sub in connection with the Financing or any other financing, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (a) upon reasonable advance notice by
Parent, appropriate officers and employees to be available on a customary
basis for meetings, including management presentations and "road show"
appearances, and the preparation of disclosure documents in connection with
any such financing and (b) its independent accountants and counsel to provide
assistance to Parent and Merger Sub for fees consistent with the Companys
existing arrangements with such accountants and counsel.

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters becomes unavailable otherwise than due to the breach of
representations and warranties or covenants of the Company or a failure of a
condition to be satisfied by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange alternative financing from the same
or other sources on terms that are no more adverse to the ability of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;



 

40 _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required
to obtain any alternative financing on economic terms that are less favorable
to Merger Sub in any event than those set forth in the Financing Letters
(taking into account any "flex" provisions contained therein).

Section 8.6 _Debt Tender_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 10.1, the Company shall, upon receiving any written request by
Parent to do so, promptly commence or cause to be commenced an offer to

Animal Supplies Stores, Inc.s 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the
" _2011 Notes_ ") on price terms that are acceptable to Parent and such other
customary terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent (including the related consent solicitation, the " _Debt Offer_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , in lieu of the Debt Offer, if Parent so elects,
immediately prior to the Closing and using funds provided (or caused to be
provided) by Parent, the Company shall effect, or cause to be effected, a
covenant defeasance of the 2011 Notes pursuant to Section 8.03 of the
Indenture, dated as of October 26, 2001, by and among PETCO Animal Supplies
Stores, Inc., U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, and the guarantors thereto (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the " _Indenture_ ") governing
the 2011 Notes. The Consent Solicitation shall seek to obtain the waiver of
and eliminate all of the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture (as
reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and in a manner consistent
with the provisions set forth on Section 8.6 of the Disclosure Letter and as
are reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Financing). The Company shall waive any of the conditions to
the Debt Offer as may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the
condition that the Debt Offer is conditioned on the Closing of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby), so long as such waivers would not
cause the Debt Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended, or any other applicable Law, and shall not, without the
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer or make any changes
to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer other than as agreed between
Parent and the Company.

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that, immediately following the consent
expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, it shall cause
PETCO Animal Supplies Stores, Inc. to execute a supplemental indenture to the
indenture governing the 2011 Notes, which supplemental indenture shall
implement the amendments set forth in the Offer Documents and shall become
operative immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer).
Concurrent with the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company to accept for
payment and, using funds provided (or caused to be provided) by Parent,
thereafter promptly pay for properly tendered and not withdrawn 2011 Notes.
Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the Closing
of all properly tendered and not withdrawn 2011 Notes.



 

41 (c) Promptly upon receiving any written request by Parent to do so, the
Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with the Debt Offer, including the offer to
purchase, related letter of transmittal and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Company shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. All
mailings to the holders of the 2011 Notes in connection with the Debt Offer
shall be subject to the prior review and comment by the Company and Parent
and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to
the completion of the Debt Offer any information in the Offer Documents should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the 2011 Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.6, the Company
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable Law to
the extent such Laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, as a condition precedent to
its obligations to consummate the Debt Offer, the Company shall have obtained
any and all requisite consents, as determined in its reasonable discretion,
necessary to consummate the Debt Offer under all agreements governing the
outstanding indebtedness evidenced under and pursuant to that certain Credit
Agreement, dated as of January 13, 2005, by and among the Company, PETCO
Animal Supplies Stores, Inc., the financial institutions party thereto as
lenders, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as sole lead arranger, book
runner and administrative agent for the lenders, Bank of America N.A., as
syndication agent, and U.S. Bank National Association and Union Bank of
California, N.A., as co-documentation agents.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1
other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company, then the
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Debt Offer and shall indemnify the Company for any
liabilities incurred by the Company pursuant to the Debt Offer, except to the
extent that the Companys actions are inconsistent with the written
instructions of Parent or the terms of this Section 8.6.

Section 8.7 _Public Announcements_. The parties will consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and, except for
any press release or public statement as may be required by applicable Law or
any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system listing agreement, will not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
consent of the other parties.

Section 8.8 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name



 

42 and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,

the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
of the Company.

Section 8.9 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the parties hereto shall
promptly notify the other party of: 

(i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect;

(ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event, the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause
the failure by such party to comply with or satisfy, any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

(iii) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

(iv) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

(v) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of such partys knowledge threatened against, or affecting such
party which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.10 _Confidentiality Agreement_. The parties acknowledge the
Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein
as if it were set forth in its entirety, shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms and be unaffected by any termination of

Effective Time if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed by each party, in the case of an amendment by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver
is to be effective; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after the adoption of this

privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies

substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an

Section 11.9 _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_. The parties hereby

the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Delaware state court or, if

contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than a Delaware state court or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 11.1.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any

any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Agreement, (i) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
