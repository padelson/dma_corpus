RECITALS

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent and the Company have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and shareholders to engage in a
business combination pursuant to which Parent will acquire all of the
registered ordinary shares, par value CHF 4.10 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Common Shares_ "), and each holder of Company Common Shares will
receive in respect of each Company Common Share an amount of cash and a
fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable subordinate voting share, without
par value, of Parent (" _Parent Share_ ") as set forth herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent will (a)
form a new wholly-owned British Columbia unlimited liability company ("
_Canada Sub_ "), (b) cause Canada Sub to form a new wholly-owned Swiss or
Luxembourg limited liability company (" _Bid Sub_ "), (c) cause Bid Sub to
form a new direct, wholly-owned Swiss limited liability company (" _Merger
Sub_ ") and (d) cause each of Canada Sub, Bid Sub and Merger Sub to execute
joinders to this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent will cause Bid Sub to commence an exchange offer (as it
may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding Company Common Shares, in which
Offer each Company Common Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
would be exchanged for the Offer Price on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , following the consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the parties intend that, in accordance with
the laws of Switzerland and the merger agreement, among Bid Sub, Merger Sub
and the Company, substantially in the form as mutually agreed between Parent
and the Company (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), Merger Sub and the Company shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate a statutory merger pursuant
to which the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_
"), and Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) continue as
the surviving entity of the Merger, and each Company Common Share (other than
Company Common Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent, Bid Sub or
Merger Sub) that is not validly tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer
will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, and each Company Common Share directly or indirectly owned by Parent,
Bid Sub or Merger Sub will thereupon be cancelled without any conversion
thereof, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Companys board of directors has (a) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders of the Company, and
has adopted and approved, and declared it advisable for the Company to enter
into this Agreement and any future agreements implementing the provisions of
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and effect the Articles Amendment, the
Board Modification, the Special Dividend Proposal and the Merger,

 



      
 

 



 

and (b) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve and
adopt the Articles Amendment, the Board Modification and the Special Dividend
Proposal and accept the Offer and tender their Company Common Shares in the
Offer;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , (a) the board of directors of Parent has adopted and approved
and declared, and Parent will cause the Boards of Managing Directors ( _Gesch
aftsfuhrung_) of Bid Sub and Merger Sub to adopt and approve and declare, it
advisable to enter into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement (with respect
to Bid Sub and Merger Sub only) upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, and (b) the board of directors of Parent has (i) authorized and
approved the issuance of Parent Shares in the Offer and the Merger (the "
_Parent Share Issuance_ ") and (ii) resolved to recommend to its shareholders
that the Parent Share Issuance be approved by the shareholders of Parent;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a material inducement to the Company to enter into this
Agreement, and simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, certain
shareholders of Parent are entering into an agreement in the form of _Annex
B_ (the " _Parent Shareholder Voting Agreement_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a material inducement to Parent to enter into this
Agreement, pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have each of the directors and executive
officers of the Company enter into an agreement in the form of _Annex C_
(each, a " _Company Shareholder Voting Agreement_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Company and Parent desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company intend that, if the Consideration Threshold is met, the Offer and
the Merger shall be treated as a single integrated transaction and shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and by approving
resolutions authorizing this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, to adopt this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , for Canadian tax purposes, Parent, Bid Sub, Merger Sub and the
Company intend that the Merger shall qualify as a foreign merger within the
meaning of Subsection 87(8.1) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada).

 



 

 **NOW** , **THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective covenants, agreements, representations and warranties herein
contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 _ARTICLE I_

 



 

THE OFFER

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with its terms and (ii) the Company shall have complied with its
applicable obligations under _Section 1.4_, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Bid Sub to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer at the Offer Price as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
effectiveness of the Parent Registration Statement. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent may consummate the Offer through Bid Sub, its wholly-owned
Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) The obligation of Bid Sub (and Parents obligation to cause Bid Sub) to
accept for exchange, and exchange the Offer Price for, any Company Common
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the
condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of
the Offer (other than Company Common Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery
where actual delivery has not occurred), prior to the scheduled expiration of
the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not withdrawn, a number of
Company Common Shares that, together with any Company Common Shares then
directly or indirectly owned by Parent, Bid Sub or Merger Sub, represents at
least 90% of all outstanding Company Common Shares (excluding shares held by
the Company) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the other conditions set
forth in _Annex A_ (the Minimum Condition and such other conditions
collectively referred to herein as the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Parent and Bid
Sub expressly reserve the right in their sole and absolute discretion to waive
any of the Offer Conditions (if such waiver is permitted hereunder) and to
modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ that unless previously approved in
writing by the Company in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, (A) the
Minimum Condition may not be amended or waived ( _provided_ that if all the
conditions in _Annex A_ (other than the Minimum Condition and conditions that
shall be satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied or (if such waiver
is permitted hereunder) waived, Parent may elect, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to waive the Minimum Condition down to 66 2/3% of all outstanding
Company Common Shares (excluding shares held by the Company)), (B) no change
may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid or decreases the
cash per Company Common Share, the number of Company Common Shares sought in
the Offer or the number of Parent Shares per Company Common Share and (C) no
change may be made that amends in a manner adverse to the holders of Company
Common Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any waiver
of the Minimum Condition other than in accordance with the proviso in clause
(A)), or adds to, the Offer Conditions, _provided_ , that Bid Sub may change
the amount of Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration offered as
contemplated by and in accordance with this Agreement and (C) except as set
forth in _Section 1.1(c)_, the Offer may not be extended.

 



 

(c) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
twenty-first (21st) Business Day (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is
commenced. Subject to the parties respective termination rights under
_Section 9.1_ (if applicable), (i) if, at the scheduled or extended
expiration date of the Offer, any Offer Condition has not been satisfied or
waived (if such waiver is permitted hereunder), Bid Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Bid Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of ten (10)
Business Days each or such other number of Business Days as the parties may
agree in order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions, until the
earlier to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver (if such waiver is
permitted hereunder) of all of the Offer Conditions and (y) the End

 



      
 

 



 

Date (as may be extended pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_), and (ii) Bid Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Bid Sub to) extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or the New York Stock
Exchange (including any successor exchange, " _NYSE_ ") applicable to the
Offer or any period required by applicable Law. Following the expiration of
the Offer, Bid Sub may elect to provide one or more subsequent offering
periods (each, a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule
14d-11 of the Exchange Act and in compliance with all other provisions of
applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Common
Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or validly
tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid to the holder thereof
in cash and Parent Shares, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding
Taxes.

 



 

(d) Subject to the foregoing and other applicable Law and upon the terms of
and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Bid Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Bid Sub to) accept for exchange, as promptly as permitted under
applicable securities Law, and exchange and pay for, or cause to be exchanged
and paid for, (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax), as
promptly as practicable after the date on which Bid Sub first accepts Company
Common Shares for exchange pursuant to the Offer (the date and time of such
first acceptance, regardless of any Subsequent Offering Periods pursuant to
Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, the " _Acceptance Time_ "), all Company
Common Shares (i) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or
(ii) validly tendered in any such Subsequent Offering Period. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the
SEC and the terms and conditions of the Offer, Parent and Bid Sub expressly
reserve the right to delay exchanges of Company Common Shares in order to
comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws. Any such delay shall be
effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(e) No fraction of a Parent Share shall be issued in connection with the
Offer, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares shall
be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, each tendering
Company shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional Parent
Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Shares that otherwise would
have been received by such Company shareholder) shall, upon surrender of (i)
certificates registered in the name of such shareholder and representing
outstanding Company Common Shares (each, a " _Company Certificate_ ") or (ii)
evidence of uncertificated shares of Company Common Shares represented by
book-entry (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), in each case, be entitled to
receive an amount of cash (without interest and subject to the amount of any
withholding taxes as contemplated by _Section 3.2(i)_) rounded to the nearest
whole cent determined by multiplying (i) the Acceptance Time Parent Share
Price by (ii) the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that such cash payment in lieu
of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration,
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying
the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by
the issuance of fractional shares.

 



 

(f) The Company agrees that no Company Common Shares held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Bid Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Bid Sub to) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_")
that shall contain an offer to exchange and a form of related letter of
transmittal (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the Parent Registration Statement and such other ancillary documents
as may be required, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Bid Sub agree to
use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer: (x) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
the Companys shareholders as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal and, if applicable, Canadian securities Laws and the Swiss Code of
Obligations, (y) deliver a copy of the Offer Documents to the Company at its
principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act and (z) give telephonic notice of the information required by
Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first
class mail a copy of the Offer Documents to the NYSE in accordance with Rule
14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Bid Sub in writing all information concerning the
Company, its directors, officers and Affiliates as may be required by
applicable securities Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Bid Sub for
inclusion in the Schedule TO or the other Offer Documents. Parent and Bid Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Bid Sub to) use their reasonable best efforts
to: (x) cause the Schedule TO and the other Offer Documents to comply in all
material respects with (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (B) the
rules and regulations of the NYSE and the TSX, (C) the rules and regulations
of FINRA and (D) the Swiss Code of Obligations, in each case, as applicable.
If at any time before consummation of the Offer Parent shall become aware that
there has occurred an event that is required to be set forth in an amendment
to the Schedule TO or in a supplement to the other Offer Documents: (1) Parent
shall promptly prepare such an amendment or supplement; and (2) Parent shall
promptly file with the SEC and distribute to the shareholders of the Company
such amendment or supplement, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Law and the Swiss Code of Obligations. Each of
Parent, Bid Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the other Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company and Parent will, and will cause their
respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the other in the
preparation of the Schedule TO and the other Offer Documents. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, provide the Company and its Representatives with a
reasonable opportunity, in advance of initial filing or any amendment or
filing of any supplement thereto, to review and comment on the Schedule TO and
the other Offer Documents. Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing
of the receipt of any written or oral comments from or other correspondence
with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the other Offer
Documents and any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Schedule TO or the other Offer Documents or for additional
information and shall promptly supply the Company with copies of all
correspondence between it and any of its Representatives or Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Schedule TO or the other Offer Documents.

 



 

(h) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with _Section 3.2_ the funds and Parent Shares necessary to accept
for payment, and pay for, any

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Shares that Bid Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment,
and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(i) If, between the date hereof and the date on which any Company Common Share
is accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer, the Company Common
Shares are changed (or a record date for such change occurs) into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted, taking into
account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for
such transaction.

 



 

(j) If, between the date hereof and the date on which any Company Common Share
is accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding
Parent Shares are changed (or a record date for such change occurs) into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any division or subdivision
of shares, stock dividend, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted, taking into account the record and
payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for such transaction.

 



 

(k) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, Bid Sub
shall not (and Parent shall cause Bid Sub not to) terminate or withdraw the
Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date without the prior written consent
of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, except that in the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, Bid Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Bid Sub to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) following such termination irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Company Common Shares pursuant
thereto. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this Agreement prior to
the purchase of Company Common Shares in the Offer, Bid Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Bid Sub to) promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on
behalf of Bid Sub to return, all tendered Company Common Shares to the
tendering shareholders of the Company.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Parent Shareholder Meeting_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in order to
facilitate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) seek approval as promptly as
practicable from the TSX to the Parent Shareholder Approval being obtained by
written consent of the holders of Parent Shares and multiple voting shares of
Parent representing more than 50% of the votes attached to all outstanding
Parent Shares and multiple voting shares of Parent, voting together, in lieu
of holding a Parent Shareholder Meeting (the " _Parent Shareholder Written
Consent_ "), and (ii) seek to obtain, in compliance with applicable Law, the
Parent Shareholder Written Consent. In the event that the Parent Shareholder
Written Consent is not obtained, or the TSX is not willing to grant
conditional approval for the listing of the Parent Shares issuable pursuant to
the Parent Share Issuance based on the Parent Shareholder Written Consent,
then in either case, subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall:

 



 

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting
in accordance with Parents articles of incorporation and by-laws and
applicable Laws,

 



      
 

 



 

on such date and at such time as Parent and the Company agree, but in no event
later than 40 days following the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement,
for the purpose of having the shareholders of Parent consider the Parent Share
Issuance and will not, unless the Company otherwise consents in writing,
cancel the Parent Shareholder Meeting or propose to do so;

 



 

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the shareholders of
Parent proxies in favor of the approval of the Parent Share Issuance and
ensure that all proxies solicited by the Parent and its Representatives in
connection with the Parent Shareholder Meeting are solicited in compliance
with (i) applicable Law, (ii) its articles of incorporation and by-laws and
(iii) the rules and regulations of the TSX; and

 



 

(iii) include in the Parent Meeting Materials the Parent Recommendation.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent, after consultation with the Company, may (but shall not be required
to) adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting if (i) any amendment or
supplement to the Parent Meeting Materials required to be provided to Parents
shareholders has not been so provided or (ii) as of the time for which the
Parent Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of Parent represented (either in person or by proxy) at the Parent
Shareholder Meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Parent Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting pursuant to this
_Section 1.2(b)_ more than twice without the prior written consent of the
Company. Following the Parent Shareholder Meeting and at or before the
Closing, Parent shall deliver to the corporate secretary of the Company a
certificate setting forth the voting results from the Parent Shareholder
Meeting.

 



 

(c) To the extent a Parent Shareholder Meeting is called pursuant to this
_Section 1.2_, each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting and the Company
Shareholder Meeting, respectively, at the same time and on the same date as
the other party.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary herein, if (i) Parent
makes a Consideration Mix Change and (ii) because of such Consideration Mix
Change the Parent Shareholder Approval is no longer required by applicable Law
or the rules and regulations of the TSX, the provisions of this _Section 1.2_
and _Section 1.3_ shall immediately terminate and no longer be applicable or
of any further force or effect.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Parent Meeting Materials_.

 



 

(a) Parent will ensure that the Parent Meeting Materials comply in all
material respects with applicable securities Law and the rules and regulations
of the TSX, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that the
Parent Meeting Materials (including with respect to any information
incorporated therein by reference) will not contain a misrepresentation
(within the meaning of applicable Canadian provincial and territorial
securities Laws) (other than in each case with respect to any information
furnished by the Company) and will provide the

 



      
 

 



 

shareholders of Parent with information in sufficient detail to permit them to
form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters to be placed before them at
the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

 



 

(b) The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning
the Company, its directors, officers and Affiliates as may be required by
applicable securities Law or the rules and regulations of the TSX for
inclusion in the Parent Meeting Materials.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the other in the preparation of
the Parent Meeting Materials. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, provide the
Company and its Representatives with a reasonable opportunity, in advance of
initial filing or any amendment or filing of any supplement thereto, to review
and comment on the Parent Meeting Materials. Parent will keep the Company
reasonably informed in a timely manner of any requests or comments made by the
Ontario Securities Commission (the " _OSC_ ") or TSX in connection with the
Parent Meeting Materials.

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent will each promptly notify the other if at any time
before the Parent Shareholder Meeting it becomes aware (in the case of the
Company only with respect to the Company and in the case of Parent only with
respect to Parent) that the Parent Meeting Materials contains any
misrepresentation or otherwise requires any amendment or supplement and
promptly deliver written notice to the other party setting out full
particulars thereof. In any such event, the Company and Parent will cooperate
with each other in the preparation, filing and dissemination of any required
supplement or amendment to the Parent Meeting Materials or such other
document, as the case may be, and any related news release or other document
necessary or desirable in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) Provided that no Company Recommendation Withdrawal shall have occurred in
accordance with _Section 7.4(g)_ and _7.4(h)_ , the Company hereby consents
to the inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The
Company shall instruct its transfer agent to promptly furnish Parent with a
true and correct list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the
Companys shareholders and their addresses, as well as mailing labels
containing such names and addresses, and shall provide to Parent and Bid Sub
such additional information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing
labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent
may reasonably request for purposes of communicating the Offer to the
Companys shareholders. Parent and Bid Sub (and their respective
Representatives) shall hold all information furnished in accordance with this
_Section 1.4_ in confidence in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information solely in connection
with the communication and implementation of the Offer and, if this Agreement
shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, promptly return to the
Company or destroy any and all copies and any extracts or summaries of such
information in their possession or control.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to the shareholders
of the Company a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any amendments or

 



      
 

 



 

supplements thereto, including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_")
that, unless a Company Recommendation Withdrawal shall have occurred in
accordance with _Section 7.4(g)_ and _7.4(h)_ , shall contain the Company
Recommendation. Each of Parent and Bid Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Bid
Sub to) promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning
Parent and Bid Sub that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably
requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. If at any time
before consummation of the Offer the Company shall become aware that there has
occurred an event that is required to be set forth in an amendment to the
Schedule 14D-9: (1) the Company shall promptly prepare such an amendment or
supplement; and (2) the Company shall promptly file with the SEC and
distribute to the shareholders of the Company such amendment or supplement, in
each case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities
Law and the Swiss Code of Obligations. Each of Parent, Bid Sub and the Company
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company and Parent will, and
will cause their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the
other in the preparation of the Schedule 14D-9. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, provide Parent and its Representatives with a reasonable
opportunity, in advance of initial filing or any amendment or filing of any
supplement thereto, to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any written or oral
comments from or other correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 and any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9 or for additional information and shall
promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and any of
its Representatives or Affiliates, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff,
on the other hand, with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

(c) The Company agrees (i) to promptly upon Parents request provide all

thereon, (iii) that all information provided by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents and the Parent Meeting
Materials will not (at the respective times such materials, or any amendments
or supplements thereto, are filed with the SEC or the Canadian Securities
Regulatory Authorities, first published, sent or given to shareholders of the
Company or Parent, the Offer expires, the Parent Shareholder Meeting is held
or Parent Shares are delivered in connection with the Offer, or at the
Effective Time, as the case may be) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (iv) to promptly
correct any information provided by the Company for the Offer Documents or the
Parent Meeting Materials if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent necessary, the Company (acting
through the entire Company board of directors or a special committee of the
Company board of directors comprised solely of "independent directors"
determined in accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of

 



      
 

 



 

the Exchange Act) will take all steps that may be necessary or reasonably
advisable to cause any employee agreement, plan or arrangement (whether in
existence prior to or after the date hereof) pursuant to which consideration
is or becomes payable to any officer, director or employee to be unanimously
approved by the entire Company board of directors (or by such special
committee) as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act and
to take all actions otherwise necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Directors_.

 



 

(a) Effective upon the acceptance for exchange of Company Common Shares
pursuant to the Offer, subject to applicable Law and any listing agreement
with or rules of the NYSE, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of
directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, on the Company board of
directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Company board of directors (giving effect to the election of any additional
directors pursuant to this _Section 1.5(a)_), and (ii) a fraction having a
numerator equal to the aggregate number of Company Common Shares beneficially
owned by Parent or Bid Sub (including Company Common Shares accepted for
exchange pursuant to the Offer) and a denominator equal to the total number of
Company Common Shares (excluding shares held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). At Parents request on or
after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall (i) seek and accept resignations
of incumbent directors and (ii) have such changes registered with the
competent Commercial Registry of the Canton of Zug (the " _Registrar_ "). In
connection with the designation by Parent of individuals to serve on the

individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded
up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee of the Company board of
directors and (B) each board of (managing) directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as
such individuals represent on the Companys board of directors, in each case
subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law (including NYSE rules).

 



 

(b) The Companys obligations to propose and recommend the Board Modification
pursuant to _Sections 1.5(a)_ and _7.1(c)_ shall be subject to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and Swiss Law, as
applicable. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in
the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors, as Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder require in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 1.5_ and _Section 7.1(c)_, so long as Parent has timely provided to
the Company in writing any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Parent shall promptly
supply to the Company in writing, and shall be solely responsible for the
accuracy and completeness of, all such information.

 



 

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company board of directors pursuant to _Sections 1.5(a)_ and _7.1(c)_ , until
the Effective Time or, if the Squeeze-Out Condition has not been satisfied as
of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,

 



      
 

 



 

until the earlier of the second anniversary of the Acceptance Time and the
completion of the Squeeze-Out Merger, the Company board of directors shall
have at least two (2) directors who are directors of the Company on the date
hereof and who are neither officers of the Company nor shareholders,
Affiliates, or associates (within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
Law and the Swiss Code of Obligations) of Parent (" _Continuing Directors_ "),
as designated by Parent in its sole and absolute discretion; _provided_ that
in such event, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below
two (2), the remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate a
person to be elected by the shareholders of the Company to fill such vacancy
who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement
or, if no other Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall be
entitled to (and shall be directed by Parent to) designate directors to be
elected by the shareholders of the Company to fill such vacancies who shall
not be officers of the Company or shareholders, Affiliates or associates of
Parent, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that Parent and the
Company shall take such actions which are necessary to elect the respective
designated persons as members of the Company board of directors.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
election of Parents designees to the Company board of directors pursuant to
_Section 1.5(a)_ and until the Effective Time, or, if the Squeeze-Out
Condition has not been satisfied as of immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time, until the earlier of the second anniversary of the Acceptance Time and
the completion of the Squeeze-Out Merger, any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any amendment of this Agreement, any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Bid Sub, any
waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein
for the benefit of the Company or its shareholders (other than Parent, Bid Sub
or their Affiliates), officers, directors or employees, or of any right of the
Company under this Agreement, any amendment of the Companys articles of
association or organization regulations, any amendment or change to or any
other consent or action by the Company board of directors with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby or in connection herewith shall only be
effected if there are in office one or more Continuing Directors and such
action is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office
(or by the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one Continuing
Director). The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and
shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce performance of this Agreement.

(b) In accordance with Article 16 Swiss Merger Act, during a period of 30 days
prior to the passing of the resolution by the shareholders of the Company and
the quota holder of Merger Sub, the Company and Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) allow their shareholders and quota holder,

the following documents of both the Company and Merger Sub: Merger Agreement,

(c) Prior to the passing of the resolution by the shareholders of the Company

meeting and quota holders meeting, respectively, about the outcome of the
consultation before such resolution is passed;

 



 

(d) The Company and Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
cause a meeting of its shareholders and quota holder, respectively, (in the
case of the Company, the " _Subsequent Company Shareholder Meeting_ " and, in
the case of Merger Sub, the " _Subsequent Merger Sub Quota Holder Meeting_ ")
to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within 45 days after the Acceptance Time, for the purpose of voting on (i) the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and (ii) in the
case of the Subsequent Company Shareholder Meeting, the SERP Proposal. The
recommendation of the Companys board of directors and Merger Subs board of
managing directors, respectively, that the shareholders of the Company and the
quota holder of Merger Sub (as applicable) adopt and approve the Merger
Agreement and the Merger and approve the SERP Proposal shall be included in a
proxy statement (the " _Subsequent Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the
shareholders of the Company relating to the Subsequent Company Shareholder
Meeting and to the quota holder of the Merger Sub relating to the Subsequent
Merger Sub Quota Holder Meeting, respectively;

 



 

(e) In connection with such meetings pursuant to this _Section 1.6_, the

year anniversary of the Acceptance Time, including, without limitation,
through one or more Extraordinary Transactions.

Pursuant to article 22 paragraph 1 of the Swiss Merger Act, from and after the
Effective Time: (i) the Merger of the Company and Merger Sub and the vesting
of their undertaking, property and assets and liabilities in the Surviving
Company shall become effective; (ii) the Surviving Company shall continue to
be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the Company and
Merger Sub; and (iii) the Company will be deleted from the Commercial Register
without any winding up with liquidation of the Company within the meaning of
articles 736 _et seq._ of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Upon registration of
the Merger in the Commercial Register, the Surviving Company shall either

 



      
 

 



 

(i) give three notices to the creditors of the Company and Merger Sub by way
of publication in the Swiss Gazette of Commerce (SHAB) or (ii) obtain a
confirmation by a specially qualified auditor confirming that there are no
known or expected claims which cannot be satisfied by the freely available
assets of the legal entities involved as required pursuant to Article 25 (2)
Swiss Merger Act.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Surviving Company Articles of Association and Organizational
Regulations_. Following the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective
Time, the parties hereto shall agree in good faith on the articles of
association and organizational regulations of the Surviving Company.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Managing Directors of the Surviving Company_. The managing
directors of Merger Sub in office immediately before the Effective Time shall
be the managing directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Reorganization_. If the Consideration Threshold is met, this
Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement, is intended to constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to
which, for such purposes, the Offer and the Merger shall be treated as a
single integrated transaction and shall be treated as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent and the Company is a party
under Section 368(b) of the Code). The Merger is intended to qualify as a
foreign merger within the meaning of Subsection 87(8.1) of the Income Tax Act
(Canada).

 



 

 _ARTICLE III_

 



 

CANCELLATION OF COMPANY SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Company
Common Shares:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Company Common Shares and Payment of Merger
Consideration_. Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time (other than Company Common Shares owned by the
Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries) shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash and Parent Shares equal
to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion,
each Company Common Share shall be cancelled and each holder of a Company
Common Share shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Share except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, all
in accordance with the Swiss Merger Act. The Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or similar distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Shares or Company Common Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent
Shares or Company Common Shares having a record date on or following the date
hereof and before the Effective Time, it being understood that (i) the intent
of such adjustment is to provide the holders of Company Common Shares with the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement before any

 



      
 

 



 

such change and (ii) nothing in this _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Company-Owned or Parent-Owned Securities_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, all Company Common Shares that are (i) held by
the Company as treasury stock immediately before the Effective Time or (ii)
owned by the Company or Parent or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, in each case shall, by virtue of the
Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and
shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At least five Business Days before the Effective Time,
Parent shall designate an exchange and paying agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Company
Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. On
the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent in accordance with this _Article III_, (i) certificates,
or at Parents option, shares in book-entry form representing Parent Shares to
be exchanged in the Merger and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration payable under _Section 3.1(a)_ and any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares under _Section 3.2(e)_. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit promptly, or cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent cash in respect of any dividends or distributions to which
the shareholders of the Company may be entitled under _Section 3.2(c)_ in an
amount sufficient to pay such dividends or distributions to shareholders of
the Company that have not, as of such date, exchanged their Company Common
Shares. Such Merger Consideration and cash so deposited are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Company Common Shares on cash amounts
payable under this _Section 3.2_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments
shall be in direct obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States of
America or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be promptly paid to Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under _Sections 3.2(b)_, _3.2(c)_ and _3.2(e)_ shall be promptly
returned to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to
any such investments, or such cash diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Exchange Agent to make prompt cash payment of amounts under
_Sections 3.2(b)_, _3.2(c)_ and _3.2(e)_ , Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash so as to ensure that there is sufficient cash for the
Exchange Agent to make all such payments. Except as contemplated by _Section
3.2(g)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time and in any
event not later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
or the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person
who was a shareholder of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the parties may reasonably specify at least three

 



      
 

 



 

Business Days before the Effective Time), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Common Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to the
Company Common Shares previously held by a shareholder of the Company in
accordance with this _Section 3.2_, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
require, a holder of Company Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) a certificate or book-entry representing that number of
whole Parent Shares (rounded down) which such shareholder has the right to
receive in respect of all Company Common Shares then held by such shareholder,
(B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares that such shareholder has the right
to receive under _Section 3.2(e)_ and (C) the amount of the Cash
Consideration which such shareholder has the right to receive in respect of
the Company Common Shares then held by such shareholder of the Company, and
any Company Certificate surrendered in respect thereof, shall forthwith be
marked as cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate or book-entry representing the proper number of Parent Shares may
be issued to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such Company
Common Shares (if any) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
documents normally required to evidence and effect such transfer (reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) and by reasonable evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Shares with a record
date on or following the Effective Time shall be paid to any shareholder of
the Company holding any unexchanged Company Common Shares with respect to
Parent Shares represented thereby, nor shall any Cash Consideration or the
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares be paid to any such shareholder
under _Section 3.2(e)_, until such shareholder shall exchange such Company
Common Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article
III_. Following the exchange of any such Company Common Shares in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Article III_, such shareholder shall
be entitled to receive, in addition to the Merger Consideration set forth in
_Section 3.1(a)_, without interest, (i) at the time of such exchange, the
amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date on or
following the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld under the
immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole Parent Shares that
a shareholder holding such Company Common Shares is entitled to receive
hereunder and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date on or following the Effective Time but
before exchange and a payment date after the exchange payable with respect to
such whole Parent Shares that a shareholder holding such Company Common Shares
is entitled to receive hereunder.

 



 

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. All Merger Consideration
paid or issued upon the surrender of title to Company Common Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ (including any cash paid
under this _Article III_) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shareholders of the Company
in their capacity as shareholders of the Company before the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer
books or share registers, respectively, of the Surviving Company of the
Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to
Parent or to

 



      
 

 



 

the Surviving Company or to the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
marked as cancelled and exchanged in accordance with this _Article III_,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of a Parent Share shall be issued in connection with the
Merger, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares
shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu thereof any
shareholder of the Company who would otherwise have been entitled to a
fraction of a Parent Share shall be paid upon surrender of his or her Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange (and after taking into account
and aggregating Company Common Shares represented by all Company Certificates
surrendered by such holder, or as set out in the Company Share Register, as
applicable) cash in an amount (without interest and subject to the amount of
any withholding taxes as contemplated by _Section 3.2(i)_) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which
such shareholder (after taking into account and aggregating all Company Common
Shares represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such
shareholder, or as set out in the Company Share Register, as applicable) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Acceptance Time Parent Share Price.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. Subject to applicable Law, if
any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions as may be required under this _Article III_ in respect of the
Company Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates; _provided_ that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct or otherwise indemnify Parent in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Company Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Unless a longer period is prescribed by
applicable Law or Parents agreement with the Exchange Agent, any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders of the
Company for one year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Shares.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable to any
shareholder of the Company in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ that remain
undistributed to the shareholders of the Company shall be delivered to and
become the property of Parent on the Business Day immediately before the day
that such property is required to be delivered to any public official under
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding
anything in the Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, none of Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
shareholder of the Company for any such property delivered to Parent or to a
public official under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



 

(i) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Company (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payments under any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. The parties agree to cooperate reasonably with each
other for purposes of determining whether any Taxes are required to be
withheld with respect to the Merger.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Other Company Stock-Based
Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Acceptance Time, each right to purchase Company Common Shares
granted by the Company under the Company Share Plans that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately before or as of the Acceptance Time (the " _Company
Stock Options_ "), whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested,
shall, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Acceptance Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Equity Award Consideration over
the exercise price per share of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the total number of Company Common Shares subject to
such Company Stock Option. For each Company Stock Option, if the applicable
exercise price per share of Company Common Shares equals or exceeds the Equity
Award Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration, and all rights with respect to such Company
Stock Option shall terminate as of the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(b) At the Acceptance Time, each Company Restricted Award and each Other
Company Award subject to time vesting conditions shall, without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time. Each Company Restricted Award and each Other
Company Award subject to performance vesting conditions (each, a "
_Performance Award_ ") shall, without any further action on the part of the
holder thereof, become fully vested immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,
subject to the following rules: (i) for each Performance Award for which the
applicable performance period is completed as of immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, the number of Performance Awards that shall vest as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be based on actual performance,
(ii) for each Performance Award for which the applicable performance period is
not completed as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any agreement, plan or arrangement covering such
Performance Award, the number of Performance Awards that shall vest as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be based on the target of the
applicable Performance Award (as reasonably determined by the compensation
committee of the board of directors of the Company prior to the Acceptance
Time), and (iii) each Performance Award that does not vest in accordance with
clause (i) or (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

shall be cancelled and terminated without consideration immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time. Each Company Restricted Award and Other Company Award
that vests in accordance with this _Section 3.3(b)_ shall, without any
further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and of no
further force or effect as of the Acceptance Time and automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the Equity Award Consideration and (y) the total number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company Restricted Award or Other
Company Award, as applicable, or, to the extent that an Other Company Award is
denominated in cash, rather than in Company Common Shares, the cash amount
payable pursuant to such Other Company Award, as determined in accordance with
this _Section 3.3(b)_.

 



 

(c) Following completion of the current offering period ending on December 31,
2016 (and the share purchase relating thereto), (i) subsequent offering
periods under the Companys employee stock purchase plan described in _Section
3.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ESPP_ ") shall be suspended
for periods prior to the Acceptance Time and (ii) prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall provide notice to all participants in the ESPP that
the ESPP will be terminated as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time. ESPP Shares shall be treated as Company Common Shares for all purposes
of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _ESPP Shares_ " means Company
Common Shares purchased under an ESPP.

 



 

(d) Before the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (or the
Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary or appropriate
in order to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 3.3_;
_provided_ that such resolutions and actions shall expressly be conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time and shall be of no force and effect
if this Agreement is terminated.

 



 

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, as applicable,
pay to the holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Awards and
Other Company Awards the cash amounts described in this _Section 3.3_, less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Law with respect to the vesting of the
award or making of such payment, on the first payroll date following the
Acceptance Time. Such payments shall be made either directly to such holders
or, with respect to any holders for which withholding is required, through
payroll. To the extent that amounts are withheld or deducted pursuant hereto,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Awards and Other Company Awards in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Transaction Sequence; Subsequent Merger_

 



 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to the conditions and upon
the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Transactions will be consummated in
the following order:

 



 

i. The Acceptance Time shall occur and the Offer shall be consummated; then

 



      
 

 



 

ii. The Merger shall be consummated.

 



 

In the event the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived (if
such waiver is permitted hereunder) but the Squeeze-Out Condition has not been
satisfied, the Offer shall be consummated but the Merger shall not be
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, in such event, this
Agreement may be terminated by Parent or the Company immediately after the
Acceptance Time pursuant to _Section 9.1(m)_.

 



 

(b) In the event the Merger is not consummated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement as contemplated by _Section 3.4(a)_, Parent agrees that, prior to
the earlier of the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement and the
completion of the Squeeze-Out Merger, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, consummate an Extraordinary Transaction unless either (i)
the consideration paid to the holders of Company Common Shares in such
Extraordinary Transaction is the same (including with respect to the mix of
consideration) as the Offer Price or (ii) the consummation of such
Extraordinary Transaction is conditioned on receipt of the recommendation in
favor of such Extraordinary Transaction by a majority of either (x) the
Continuing Directors that are members of the Board of Directors of the Company
or (y) the members of a special committee of the Board consisting entirely of
Continuing Directors. Parent further agrees that any public disclosure by
Parent or its Affiliates made prior to the second anniversary of the date of
this Agreement proposing an Extraordinary Transaction subject to clause (ii)
above will reference that the consummation of any such Extraordinary
Transaction will be subject to the receipt of the recommendation referred to
in the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the
Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably
believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or
assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the
Transactions or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or
after the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, then Parent, Bid Sub, Merger
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company and their respective officers and
directors shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Transactions and to carry out the purposes and
intent of this Agreement.

(b) The copies of the Companys articles of association and organizational
regulations incorporated by reference in its Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, are true and complete copies, are in full force and effect

its Subsidiaries are issued or outstanding.

other equity-related securities or awards issued or to be issued under the
Company Share Plans, there are no options, warrants, calls, convertible,

Company Shareholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby to which it is a party (other than the Merger) and (ii) subject to
obtaining the Subsequent Company Shareholder Approval, to consummate the
Merger. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby to which it is a party have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement and the Merger Agreement or to consummate the

Entities for each of the Insurance Subsidiaries of the Company for each
quarterly or annual period from and after January 1, 2013, each in the form

complete list of the Insurance Subsidiaries of the Company, together with the
jurisdiction of domicile thereof and each jurisdiction in which each such
Insurance Subsidiary is licensed to conduct the business of insurance or
reinsurance. None of the Insurance Subsidiaries of the Company is commercially
domiciled in any other jurisdiction or is otherwise treated as domiciled in a
jurisdiction other than that of its incorporation. Each of the Insurance
Subsidiaries of the Company and each of its other Subsidiaries that provide
services to its Insurance Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized, to the
extent required by Law, in each jurisdiction where it engages in business and
for each line of business written therein, except where the failure to be so
licensed or authorized has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

 



 

(b) _Section 4.12(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all material Reinsurance Agreements of the Company. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all Reinsurance Agreements of the
Company are valid and binding obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(to the extent they are parties thereto or bound thereby) and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, in accordance with their
terms and are in full force and effect, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
(to the extent they are party thereto or

 



      
 

 



 

bound thereby) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto
has performed in all respects all obligations required to be performed by it
under each Reinsurance Agreement of the Company. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received notice, nor does it have Knowledge, of any
violation or default in respect of any obligation under (or any condition
which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would result
in such a violation or default), or any intention to cancel, terminate or
change the scope of rights and obligations under, or not to renew, any
Reinsurance Agreement, except, in each case, as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, (i) since January 1, 2013, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries have received any written notice from any party to a
Reinsurance Agreement of the Company that any amount of reinsurance ceded by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such counterparty will be
uncollectible or otherwise defaulted upon; (ii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, no party to a Reinsurance Agreement of the Company is insolvent or
the subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship, receivership,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding; (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, the
financial condition of each party to a Reinsurance Agreement of the Company is
not impaired to the extent that a default thereunder is reasonably
anticipated; (iv) there are no, and since January 1, 2013 there have been no,
disputes under any Reinsurance Agreement of the Company other than disputes in
the ordinary course for which adequate loss reserves have been established;
and (v) the Companys relevant Insurance Subsidiary is entitled under any
applicable Law and Applicable SAP to take full credit in its SAP Statements
for all amounts recoverable by it pursuant to any Reinsurance Agreement of the
Company and all such amounts recoverable have been properly recorded in its
books and records of account (if so accounted therefor) and are properly
reflected in its SAP Statements and no Governmental Entity has objected to
such characterization and accounting. None of the Reinsurance Agreements of
the Company is finite reinsurance, financial reinsurance or such other form of
reinsurance that does not meet the risk transfer requirements under applicable
Laws.

 



 

(c) Except for such events or circumstances as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, with respect to any Reinsurance Agreements of
the Company for which an Insurance Subsidiary of the Company as ceding insurer
thereto is taking credit on its most recent SAP Statements, to the Companys
Knowledge, from and after January 1, 2013: (i) there has been no separate
written or oral agreement between the Company or such Insurance Subsidiary and
the assuming reinsurer that would under any circumstances reduce, limit,
mitigate or otherwise affect any actual or potential loss to the parties under
any such Reinsurance Agreement, other than inuring contracts that are
explicitly defined in any such Reinsurance Agreement; (ii) for each such
Reinsurance Agreement entered into, renewed or amended on or after January 1,
2013, for which risk transfer is not reasonably considered to be self-evident
to the extent required by any applicable provisions of SSAP No. 62,
documentation concerning the economic intent of the transaction and the risk
transfer analysis evidencing the proper accounting treatment as required by
SSAP No. 62 is available for review by the relevant Governmental Entities for
each of it and its Subsidiaries; (iii) its Insurance Subsidiary party thereto
complies and has complied in all material respects with any applicable
requirements set forth in SSAP No. 62; and (iv) its Insurance Subsidiary party
thereto has and has had appropriate controls in place

Insurance Subsidiary or placing any such Insurance Subsidiary on an "under

Subsidiary on retaining any currently held rating assigned to any such
Insurance Subsidiary.

 



 

(g) The insurance policy reserves for claims, losses (including incurred but

and notes thereto included in such SAP Statements; (ii) on the basis of
methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in computing
the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years, except as otherwise
noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such SAP
Statements; and (iii) in accordance in all material respects with applicable
Insurance Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company is not making any
representation or warranty (express or implied) as to the adequacy or
sufficiency of reserves for losses or loss expenses as of any date.

underwriting association, residual market facility or assigned risk pool. No
such claim or assessment is pending and neither the Company nor any Insurance

Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, each Agent or
Administrator (i) was duly licensed as required by Law in the particular
jurisdiction in which such Agent or Administrator wrote, sold, produced,
managed or marketed such Policies (for the type of business wrote, sold,
produced, managed or marketed on behalf of the Insurance Subsidiary), and no
Agent or Administrator is in violation of (or with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would have violated) any term or provision of any Law
applicable to the administration, management, writing, sale or production for

were prepared in accordance with IFRS applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)

executive officer and principal financial officer under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

(f) Each of Parents Insurance Subsidiaries has filed or submitted all SAP
Statements required to be filed with or submitted to the appropriate insurance
regulatory authorities of each jurisdiction in which it is licensed,
authorized or eligible on forms prescribed or permitted by such department,
except for such failures to file or submit that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. The SAP Statements of Parent were prepared in conformity with
Applicable SAP, consistently applied for the periods covered thereby, were
prepared in accordance with the books and records of the applicable Insurance
Subsidiary, and present fairly in all material respects the statutory
financial position of such Insurance Subsidiary as of the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations, cash flows, and changes in capital and
surplus (or stockholders equity, as applicable) of such Insurance Subsidiary
for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
SAP Statements of Parent, to normal year-end adjustments). The SAP Statements
of Parent complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws when
filed or submitted and no material violation or deficiency has been asserted
by any Governmental Entity with respect to any of the SAP Statements that has
not been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such Governmental
Entity. The statutory balance sheets and income statements included in the
annual SAP Statements of Parent have been audited by Parents independent
auditors. Except as is indicated therein, all assets that are reflected on the
SAP Statements of Parent comply in all material respects with all applicable
Insurance Laws regulating the investments of the Insurance Subsidiaries of
Parent and all applicable Insurance Laws with respect to admitted assets and
are in an amount at least equal to the minimum amount required by applicable
Insurance Laws. The financial statements included in the SAP Statements of
Parent accurately reflect in all material respects the extent to which,
pursuant to applicable Laws and Applicable SAP, the applicable Insurance
Subsidiary is entitled to take credit for reinsurance (or any local equivalent
concept) on such SAP Statements. Since January 1, 2015, Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries that are members of Lloyds have prepared audited accounts for
each syndicate managed by Parent for all applicable years ended December 31 in
accordance with the requirements of the Insurance Accounts Directive (Lloyds
Syndicate and Aggregate Accounts) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/3319) and the
Syndicate Accounting Byelaw (No. 8 of 2005) and such accounts show a true and
fair view of the syndicates position as of the relevant date.

Insurance Subsidiaries of Parent and each of its other Subsidiaries that
provide services to its Insurance Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized, to
the extent required by Law, in each jurisdiction where it engages in business
and for each line of business written therein, except where the failure to be
so licensed or authorized has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, all Reinsurance
Agreements of Parent are valid and binding obligations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (to the extent they are parties thereto or bound thereby) and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, in accordance with their
terms and are in full force and effect, and Parent and its Subsidiaries (to
the extent they are party thereto or bound thereby) and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, each other party thereto has performed in all respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under each Reinsurance Agreement of Parent.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice, nor does it
have Knowledge, of any violation or default in respect of any obligation under
(or any condition which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both, would result in such a violation or default), or any intention to
cancel, terminate or change the scope of rights and obligations under, or not
to renew, any Reinsurance Agreement, except, in each case, as has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material

Reinsurance Agreement of Parent is insolvent or the subject of a

to take full credit in its SAP Statements for all amounts recoverable by it
pursuant to any Reinsurance Agreement of Parent and all such amounts
recoverable have been properly recorded in its books and records of account
(if so accounted therefor) and are properly reflected in its SAP Statements,
and no Governmental Entity has objected to such characterization and
accounting. None of the Reinsurance Agreements of Parent is finite
reinsurance, financial reinsurance or such other form of reinsurance that does
not meet the risk transfer requirements under applicable Laws.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Except for such events or circumstances as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, with respect to any Reinsurance Agreements of Parent

taking credit on its most recent SAP Statements, to Parents Knowledge, from
and after January 1, 2013: (i) there has been no separate written or oral
agreement between Parent or such Insurance Subsidiary and the assuming
reinsurer that would under any circumstances reduce, limit, mitigate or
otherwise affect any actual or potential loss to the parties under any such
Reinsurance Agreement, other than inuring contracts that are explicitly
defined in any such Reinsurance Agreement; (ii) for each such Reinsurance
Agreement entered into, renewed or amended on or after January 1, 2013, for

stated to Parent that it is considering lowering any rating assigned to any
such Insurance Subsidiary or placing any such Insurance Subsidiary on an
"under review" status with negative implications and (iii) no rating agency

Insurance Subsidiary of Parent on retaining any currently held rating assigned
to any such Insurance Subsidiary.

 



 

(e) The insurance policy reserves for claims, losses (including incurred but

applied as in effect at such time, except as otherwise noted in the financial
statements and notes thereto included in such Parent SAP Statements; (ii) on
the basis of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used
in computing the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years, except as
otherwise noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such

Affiliates in connection with the preparation of the Actuarial Analyses was

were based upon, in all material respects, an accurate inventory of policies
in force for it and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the relevant time
of preparation and was prepared in all material respects in conformity with
generally accepted actuarial principles in effect at such time, consistently
applied (except as may

 



      
 

 



 

be noted therein), and the projections contained therein were prepared in
accordance with the assumptions stated therein.

 



 

(g) All Policies of Parent in effect as of the date of this Agreement and any
and all marketing materials of Parent have been, to the extent required under

Adverse Effect on Parent.

with the terms of Policies under which they arose, except for such benefits
for which an Insurance Subsidiary of Parent believes there is a reasonable
basis to contest payment.

 



 

(i) Except for regular periodic assessments in the ordinary course of business
or assessments based on developments that are publicly known within the
insurance industry, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no unpaid
claims and assessments against Parent or any Insurance Subsidiary of Parent,
whether or not due, by any insurance guaranty association (in connection with
that associations fund relating to insolvent insurers), joint underwriting
association, residual market facility or assigned risk pool. No such claim or
assessment is pending and neither Parent nor any Insurance Subsidiary of
Parent has received written notice of any such claim or assessment against
Parent or any Insurance Subsidiary of Parent by any insurance guaranty
association, joint underwriting association, residual market facility or
assigned risk pool.

 



 

(j) Parents Insurance Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, their
respective Agents and Administrators that wrote, sold, produced, managed or
marketed Policies for any of its Insurance Subsidiaries have issued, sold,
produced, managed and marketed such Policies in compliance with applicable
Laws in the respective jurisdictions in which such products have been sold,
except such non-compliance as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. To the Knowledge of Parent, each Agent or Administrator (i) was duly
licensed as required by Law in the particular jurisdiction in which such Agent
or Administrator wrote, sold, produced, managed or marketed such Policies (for
the type of business written, sold, produced, managed or marketed on behalf of
the Insurance Subsidiary), and no Agent or Administrator is in violation of
(or with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would have violated) any
term or provision of any Law applicable to the administration, management,
writing, sale or production for or on behalf of any Insurance Subsidiary of
Parent except for such failures to be licensed which have been cured, which
have been resolved or settled through agreements with applicable Governmental
Entities or which are barred by an applicable statute of limitations, and (ii)
if required by applicable Law, was duly appointed by the applicable Insurance
Subsidiary of Parent, except in the case of

on Parent.

 



 

(k) Each of Parents Insurance Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed all
reports or other filings required to be filed with any insurance regulatory
authority in the manner prescribed therefor under applicable Laws and Permits,
and no Governmental Entity has asserted any deficiency or violation with
respect thereto, except as has been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of
the Governmental Entity or except, in each case, as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries submissions, reports or other filings under applicable
insurance holding company statutes or other applicable Insurance Laws with
respect to contracts, agreements, arrangements and transactions between or
among Insurance Subsidiaries of Parent and their Affiliates, and all
contracts, agreements, arrangements and transactions in effect between any
Insurance Subsidiary of Parent and any Affiliate are in compliance with the
requirements of all applicable insurance holding company statutes or other
such Insurance Laws and all required approvals or deemed approvals of
insurance regulatory authorities with respect thereto have been received or

Section 7.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent, Bid Sub and Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Bid Sub
and Merger Sub to) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and
applicable Law to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, obtain the Transaction Approvals, and each of the Company and
Parent agrees to promptly and jointly determine what authorizations, Orders or
approvals under applicable antitrust or competition laws of any country, are
advisable and warranted (the " _Additional Antitrust Approvals_ "). In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and
Parent agrees to make, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and in any event not later than (i) January 17, 2017,
the appropriate filings and notifications required by the HSR Act and (ii)
February 22, 2017, the appropriate filings and notifications required by all
other Transaction Approvals and Additional Antitrust Approvals and to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be reasonably requested under such requirements. The Company and
Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect
to the Transactions under the HSR Act. Subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, the
Company, Parent, Bid Sub and Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Bid Sub
and Merger Sub to) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all other
third party consents required in connection with the Transaction.

 



 

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law and in each case regarding
the Transactions or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall, in
connection with the efforts referenced above to obtain the Transaction
Approvals from Governmental Entities, to the extent legally permitted, use its
reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) promptly inform the other party of any substantive
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Entity and of any substantive communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party; (iii) give the other party,
or the other partys legal

 



      
 

 



 

counsel, reasonable opportunity, in advance of the transmission thereof, to
review and comment on any substantive communication (and shall address or
include, as applicable, in such communication comments reasonably proposed by
the other party) given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, conference or substantive communication with, any Governmental Entity
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person; and (iv) unless prohibited by a Governmental Entity or other Person,
give the other party and its legal counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings, conferences and substantive communications. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the other copies of all substantive
filings, submissions, correspondence and communications from or with any
Governmental Entity (or any other Person in connection with any proceeding
initiated by a private party) in connection with the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.
The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate material provided to the other party as "Outside Counsel Only
Material," and may redact the material as necessary to (A) remove references
concerning valuation, (B) comply with contractual arrangements, (C) address
legal privilege or other confidentiality concerns, or (D) comply with
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (and in no event shall
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company agree to without the prior
written consent of Parent) take any action, including entering into any
consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, that (i) requires
the divestiture, sale, transfer or licensing of any assets, businesses or
properties of any of the Company, Parent, Bid Sub or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (other than assets, businesses or properties
that are _de minimis_ in the aggregate to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole after giving effect to the Transactions) or (ii) limits Parents
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any assets or
businesses of the Company, Parent, Bid Sub or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than assets, businesses or properties that are
_de minimis_ in the aggregate to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
after giving effect to the Transactions) (any such requirement in the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), individually or together with all other such
requirements, a " _Burdensome Regulatory Action_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any necessary approval or consent from any Person (other than a
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Transactions, neither Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose necessary approval or consent is being
solicited any amount of cash or other consideration, make any commitment or
incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person, in each case,
without the prior written consent of the other party.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall in any way limit the rights of the
Company under _Section 7.4_ or _Article IX_.

(a) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for as long as such

7.4(c)_, following the conclusion of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its

 



      
 

 



 

and their respective directors and officers to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives to,
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Person or group
relating to any Company Takeover Proposal. With respect to any Person or group
with whom such discussions or negotiations have been terminated, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly require such Person or group
to promptly return or destroy in accordance with the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement any information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company and shut down the applicable Persons or groups access to any
physical or electronic "data room" maintained by the Company or its

(b) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for as long as such
Person or group is an Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by _Section
7.4(c)_, following the conclusion of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause its and its
Subsidiaries respective directors and officers not to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or facilitate or induce any Company Takeover Proposal or
the making, submission, announcement or consummation thereof, or any proposal,
inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions
(except to notify a Person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section
7.4_) or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than to
Parent and its Representatives) any information regarding the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such information is material or
already publicly available) in connection with, or in furtherance of, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, (iii)
waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
confidentiality or "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person (other
than Parent) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) make
available any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person (other than to Parent and its Representatives) in
connection with or in response to any Company Takeover Proposal or any
proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Company Takeover Proposal, (v) authorize any of, or commit or agree to do any
of, the foregoing. In addition, except as set forth in _Section 7.4(g)_, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause
its and its Subsidiaries respective directors and officers not to and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Company
Takeover Proposal or submit to the vote of its shareholders any Company
Takeover Proposal before the termination of this Agreement or (B) enter into,
or approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend the
entering into of any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
amalgamation or merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or
understanding relating to any Company Takeover Proposal before the termination
of this Agreement (other than a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
or (C) authorize any of, or commit or agree to do any of, the foregoing.

 



 

(c) From and after the conclusion of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the
Acceptance Time, nothing in _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_ shall
prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries and Representatives at any time
following the receipt by the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal from
participating in any discussions or negotiations with, furnishing

 



      
 

 



 

information to or waiving, modifying or electing not to enforce any
confidentiality or "standstill" or similar obligation of, the Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives, if the Company board
of directors (or an authorized and empowered committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that (i) failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the Companys board of directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (ii) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that (A) before the Company may furnish any information
to, or negotiate with, any Person with respect to such a Company Takeover
Proposal, the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such Person containing confidentiality terms and "standstill" or similar
obligations not less restrictive in the aggregate to such Person and its
Representatives than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to
Parent and its Representatives (a " _Company Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and (B) all such information has previously been made available
to Parent and its Representatives or will be so made available substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person (and in any event
within 48 hours). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the conclusion
of the Go-Shop Period, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives
may continue to engage in the activities described in _Section 7.4(d)_
(subject to the limitations and obligations set forth therein) with respect
to, and the restrictions set forth in _Section 7.4(a)_ and _Section 7.4(b)_
shall not apply to, any Excluded Party (but only for so long as such Person or
group is an Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended or modified
Company Takeover Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the
conclusion of the Go-Shop Period.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
and from time to time until 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on the thirty-first
(31st) calendar day after the date of this Agreement (the period prior to such
time, the " _Go-Shop Period_ "), the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives shall have the right to, without any
allegation of breach of this Agreement by Parent, (1) solicit, initiate,
encourage, facilitate and induce any inquiry or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal, including by making
available any non-public information regarding, and affording access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in response to any
Company Takeover Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Superior Proposal; _provided_
that the Company shall make available to Parent substantially concurrently
with providing to any such other Person (and in any event within 48 hours) any
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that was not previously
provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (2) enter into or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations, or otherwise provide
assistance, in connection with, or in furtherance of, any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead
to any Company Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(e) Following the date hereof (including during the Go-Shop Period), the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours after receipt) advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal (or any
withdrawal thereof), (ii) any request for information that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company

 



       
 

 



 

Takeover Proposal and (iv) any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed
with either the Company or its Representatives concerning a Company Takeover
Proposal, such notice to include the material terms (including price) and
conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry
(including a copy of any such written Company Takeover Proposal (and any
financing commitments), request or inquiry and any amendments or modifications
thereto or if oral, a written summary thereof) and the identity of the Person
making the Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall
keep Parent fully informed on a reasonably current basis (and in any event
within 48 hours) of any material developments, material discussions or
material negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, request or
inquiry, including any changes to the material terms and conditions thereof.
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this
Agreement, enter into any agreement that would prohibit them from providing
such information or the information contemplated by the last sentence of
_Section 7.4(d)_ to Parent.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 7.4(g)_, neither the board of directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify
or qualify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, (ii) fail
to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
14D-9, or (iii) recommend or publicly propose to recommend any Company
Takeover Proposal (any action described in _clause (i)_, _(ii)_ or _(iii)_
being referred to as a " _Company Recommendation Withdrawal_ ").

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ (including
_Section 7.4(h))_, at any time before the Acceptance Time, the Companys
board of directors (or an authorized and empowered committee thereof) may make
a Company Recommendation Withdrawal in response to a Company Takeover Proposal
that the Companys board of directors (or applicable authorized and empowered
committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, in each case, if the Companys board of directors (or
applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would violate its fiduciary (or similar) duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Companys board of directors (and any authorized and empowered committee
thereof) shall not be entitled to make a Company Recommendation Withdrawal
under _Section 7.4(g)_, unless (i) the Company shall have provided to Parent
at least three Business Days before taking such action written notice that it
intends to make a Company Recommendation Withdrawal and specifying the reasons
therefor (and, if applicable, the information required by _Section 7.4(e)_),
(ii) during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any amendment or waiver to this
Agreement proposed by Parent which shall be kept confidential by the Company
(except to the extent required to be disclosed under applicable Law), (iii)
the Company has not materially breached its obligations under this _Section
7.4_ (excluding in each case inadvertent breaches which are capable of being
cured and are cured within three Business Days following the receipt of
written notice of such breach from Parent) and (iv) the Companys board of
directors (or an authorized and empowered committee thereof) shall have
determined, after taking into account all amendments and waivers to this
Agreement made in writing by

 



      
 

 



 

Parent in response to such Company Takeover Proposal by 5:00 PM New York Time
on the third Business Day of such three Business Day period, and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that (x)
failure to take action with respect to the Company Takeover Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) such Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute
a Company Superior Proposal. The parties agree that any amendment to the
financial terms (which shall include any change in (x) the form of
consideration or (y) the percentage or allocation of form of consideration) or
other material terms and conditions of a Company Takeover Proposal giving rise
to proposed actions described in _clause (i)_ above shall require a party to
provide new written notification and shall commence a new three Business Day
period under this _Section 7.4(h)_.

 



 

(i) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Shareholder Meeting and to hold a vote of its shareholders for
purposes of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by (i) a Company Recommendation Withdrawal or (ii) the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior Proposal). Unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, if the
Company makes a Company Recommendation Withdrawal, (i) the Company shall
nevertheless submit the matters contemplated by the Required Company Vote to a
vote of its shareholders and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any and all
accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect to such
Company Recommendation Withdrawal in accordance with applicable Law after
consultation with outside legal counsel.

 



 

(j) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company board of directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act (including a "stop, look and listen" communication to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if its board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law;
_provided_ that (A) any Company Recommendation Withdrawal only may be made in
accordance with _Section 7.4(g)_ and _Section 7.4(h)_ and (B) any such
disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Companys board of directors with respect
to this Agreement or a Company Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Company Recommendation Withdrawal unless the Company in connection with such
communication publicly states that the recommendation of its board of
directors with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the
prior recommendation of the Companys board of directors, without disclosing
any Company Recommendation Withdrawal.

 



 

(k) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 7.4_ by any Representatives

 



      
 

 



 

of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries), shall be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 7.4_ by the Company.

use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or facilitate or induce any Parent Takeover Proposal or
the making, submission, announcement or consummation thereof, or any proposal,
inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions
(except to notify a Person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section
7.5_) or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than to the
Company and its Representatives) any information regarding Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such information is material or
already publicly available) in connection with, or in furtherance of, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any Parent Takeover Proposal, (iii)
waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
confidentiality or "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person (other
than the Company) with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) make
available any non-public information regarding Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person (other than to the Company and its Representatives)
in connection with or in response to any Parent Takeover Proposal or any
proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Parent Takeover Proposal, or (v) authorize any of, or commit or agree to do
any of, the foregoing. In addition, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries respective

indirectly, (A) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Parent Takeover Proposal or submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Parent Takeover Proposal, (B) enter into, or approve or
recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend the entering into of any

14d-9 under the Exchange Act (including a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or Section
2.17(2)(c) of NI 62-104).

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 7.5_ by any Representatives of Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries),
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.5_ by Parent.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and, to the extent
applicable, shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law (and, in the case of former directors and
officers, to the extent permitted by the articles of association and
organizational resolutions of the Company in effect immediately before the
Closing and applicable Law), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, each Person who is now, or has been at any time
before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities, penalties or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of
or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts
or omissions occurring, at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or

hereby.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.7(c)_, the organizational documents of the
Surviving Company shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the Company Indemnified Parties at least as
favorable as those in effect on the date of this Agreement. Following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, maintain in effect the provisions in its organizational
documents providing for indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to
the facts or circumstances occurring at or before the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law, which
provisions shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law or except
to make changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of
the Company Indemnified Parties indemnification rights thereunder.

 



 

(c) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 7.7(c)_, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, either (i) continue to maintain in effect for
six years from the Effective Time directors and officers liability insurance

directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(the " _Company Current Insurance_ ") with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to matters existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated hereby), or (ii) purchase a six year
extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Company Current
Insurance and maintain this endorsement in full force and effect for its full
term. To the extent purchased after the date hereof and before the Effective
Time, such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with
such insurance carriers as may be specified by the Company and as are
reasonably acceptable to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend for any such
policies contemplated by this _Section 7.7(c)_ an annual premium (measured
for purposes of any "tail" by reference to 1/6th the aggregate premium paid
therefor) amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the

consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other Person and is not

successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company assume and honor the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.7_.

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company agree
not to, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained
in the agreements listed in Section 7.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(f) The provisions of _Section 7.7(a)_ through _(e)_ above: (i) are
expressly intended to be for the benefit of, and shall (subject to the second
sentence of _Section 7.7(b)_) be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and legal representatives; and (ii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Parent
and the Surviving Company shall pay or cause to be paid (as incurred) all
expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that a Company
Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this _Section 7.7_ (subject to reimbursement if the Company

such press release or public statement (and shall address or include, as
applicable, in such press release or public statement comments

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably proposed by the other party); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
consultation obligation shall not apply to any press release or other public
statement relating to any actual or contemplated dispute among the parties to
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) As of the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, continue to employ each Person employed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time (such employees, collectively,
the " _Employees_ "). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute a
guarantee of continued employment of any Employee.

 



 

(b) From the Acceptance Time through the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) provide each Employee
with (i) a base salary or hourly wage that is no less than the base salary or
hourly wage that such Employee received from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (ii) incentive
compensation opportunities (including annual and long-term incentive
compensation opportunities, but excluding any change in control or retention
pay or benefits in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) that are no less than the incentive compensation opportunities
provided to such Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and (iii) employee benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to such
Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from and after the Acceptance
Time and on or before the first anniversary of the Acceptance Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to provide such Employee with the payments and benefits
determined in accordance with Section 7.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
in each case taking into account all service with the Company, Parent and
their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that any severance
payment or benefit provided to such terminated Employee shall be subject to
the execution and effectiveness of a general release of claims.

 



 

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall ensure that any Compensation and Benefit
Plan in which the Employees are eligible to participate after the Acceptance
Time shall, to the extent applicable, take into account for all purposes,
including eligibility, accrual and vesting thereunder (but not for purposes of
defined benefit pension benefit accruals), except to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits or the funding thereof, service by the
Employees with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (and any applicable
predecessor) before the Acceptance Time, to the same extent such service was
credited before the Acceptance Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Employees under any Parent Benefit Plan in
which such Employees may be eligible to participate after the Acceptance Time
(except to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or requirements applied
to the

 



      
 

 



 

Employee under comparable Company Benefit Plans) and (ii) provide each
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
calendar year in which the Acceptance Time occurs in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare or benefit plans in
which such Employee is eligible to participate during such year.

 



 

(f) To the extent that the Company has not paid annual bonuses for the 2016
calendar year generally to its Employees prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay, no later than March 15,
2017, such bonuses to Employee in the amounts (less any applicable
withholding) determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company prior to
the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall (i) be construed to
establish or be treated as an amendment or modification of any Compensation
and Benefit Plan, (ii) alter or limit Parents or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries, following the Acceptance Time)
ability to amend, modify or interpret or terminate any Compensation and
Benefit Plan at any time in accordance with the terms of such plan and
applicable Law or (iii) give any third party, including any Employee, any
right to rely upon or demand or enforce the provisions of this _Section 7.9_.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Listing; Reservation for Issuance_. Parent shall apply for and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain conditional approval of the
listing and posting for trading on the TSX to be effective no later than the
Acceptance Time all Parent Shares to be issued in the Offer and Merger to
shareholders of the Company (the " _Listed Parent Shares_ "), subject only to
the satisfaction by Parent of customary listing conditions of the TSX. Parent
shall take all action necessary to reserve for issuance, on or before the
Closing Date, any Listed Parent Shares that, by their terms and in accordance
with this Agreement, will not be issued until after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(a) If the Consideration Threshold is met, the parties intend the Offer and
the Merger to be a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and, in such
case, will report it as such for U.S. federal, state and local income tax
purposes. Except with respect to Parents election to increase the Cash
Consideration pursuant to a Consideration Mix Change, none of the parties will
knowingly take any action or fail to take any action, which action or failure
to act is reasonably likely to cause the Offer and the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Consideration Threshold is met, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
representations of officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company to be relied
on by counsel in rendering a written opinion that the Offer and Merger will be
treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 



 

(c) Except with respect to actions undertaken pursuant to this Agreement,
none of the parties hereto will knowingly take any action that is reasonably
likely to cause the Merger to

 



      
 

 



 

fail to qualify as a "foreign merger" within the meaning of Subsection 87(8.1)
of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada).

 



 

Section 7.12 _Notification_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent, and
Parent shall promptly notify the Company, of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity or the NYSE
or the TSX (or any other securities market) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable, (b) any matter (including a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement) that would
reasonably be expected to lead to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
to the Offer in _Annex A_ or the Closing in _Article VIII_ or would trigger
a right of termination under _Section 9.1_ and (c) any Action commenced or,
to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Failure to comply with this _Section 7.12_
shall not result in the failure of any condition under _Annex A_ or _Article
VIII_ to be satisfied, unless such condition would have otherwise been
satisfied but for such failure to comply with this _Section 7.12_.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Formation and Obligations of Bid Sub and Merger Sub_. As soon
as practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall organize Canada Sub, Bid
Sub and Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law. Parent shall cause each
of Bid Sub and Merger Sub to (i) enter into a written joinder agreement
promptly following the organization of Bid Sub and Merger Sub, pursuant to
which Bid Sub and Merger Sub will agree to become a party to and be bound by
the terms of this Agreement and (ii) take any action required by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement to be taken by Bid Sub or Merger Sub, as
applicable, from the date of its organization through the Closing. Prior to
the Effective Time, Bid Sub and Merger Sub will not undertake any activity
except for any activity specifically required by this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or otherwise required to consummate the Transactions. Unless Parent
makes a Consideration Mix Change pursuant to the definition of "Cash
Consideration" contained in this Agreement that prevents the Offer and the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, as soon as practicable after their respective formations,
each of Canada Sub, Bid Sub and Merger Sub will file an election on IRS Form
8832 that its initial classification for United States federal income tax
purposes will be disregarded as a separate entity.

 



 

Section 7.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, each of Parent and
the Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Shares) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.15 _Anti-Takeover Statute_. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any

 



      
 

 



 

Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement (including the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby). If any Takeover
Law is or may become applicable to this Agreement (including the Transactions
and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of the Company, Parent,
Bid Sub and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors shall (and
Parent shall cause Bid Sub and Merger Sub to) grant all such approvals and
take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the
terms contemplated hereby, and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Law on such transactions.

 



 

Section 7.16 _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of any Action relating to this Agreement by any
securityholder of the Company and permit Parent to participate in the defense
thereof. The Company shall not settle or offer to settle any such Action
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall promptly notify
the Company in writing of any Action relating to this Agreement by any
securityholder of Parent and permit the Company to participate in the defense
thereof. Parent shall not settle or offer to settle any such Action without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph,
"participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
litigation by the litigating party, consistent with the common interest of
Parent and the Company in these matters and the applicable privileges and
protections provided therein, and the non-litigating party may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to the litigation, but will not be afforded any
decision making power or other authority over the litigation except for the
settlement consent set forth above.

 



 

Section 7.17 _Supplemental Indentures_. To the extent required, concurrently
with the Closing, the Surviving Company shall (a) issue and cause to be
executed by the requisite parties supplemental indentures pursuant to _Section
9.1_ of (i) that certain Senior Indenture, dated as of November 15, 2010,
between Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. and The Bank of New York
Mellon, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
November 15, 2010, between Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. and
The Bank of New York Mellon and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
December 30, 2010, among Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, Allied
World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. and The Bank of New York Mellon (as
supplemented, the " _2010 Allied World Indenture_ ") and (ii) that certain
Senior Indenture, dated as of October 29, 2015, among Allied World Assurance
Company Holdings, AG, Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. and The
Bank of New York Mellon, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture,
dated as of October 29, 2015, among Allied World Assurance Company Holdings,
AG, Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as supplemented, the " _2015 Allied World Indenture_ " and together
with the 2010 Allied World Indenture, the " _Allied World Indentures_ "), and
(b) comply with the applicable provisions of the Allied World Indentures,
including, the delivery of any opinion of counsel required thereunder.

 



 

Section 7.18 _Special Dividend_. Subject to applicable Laws:

 



 

(a) Following the Company Shareholder Approval, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Acceptance Time and restrictions under Swiss law, the
Company shall declare

 



      
 

 



 

and pay a special dividend of $5.00 per Company Common Share (the " _Special
Dividend_ ") payable to holders of record of outstanding Company Common Shares
as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. The Company shall cause the
Special Dividend to be paid, without interest, as soon as possible after, but
in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after, the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(b) If, between the date hereof and the Acceptance Time, the outstanding
Company Common Shares are changed (or a record date for such change occurs)
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Special Dividend shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted, taking
into account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be,
for such transaction.

 



 

Section 7.19 _Financing Assistance_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such
cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) to Parent as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with any financing, including by way of
public offering or private placement in Canada, the United States or
elsewhere, carried out by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, including (i) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and

incorporate by reference, in any offering memorandum or prospectus, the
Companys financial statements and such accountants reports thereon and to
deliver customary consents and comfort letters in connection with such
financial statements and translated versions of such financial statements and
reports, together with customary translation opinions; and (v) providing, and
using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys accountants to
provide, assistance to Parent in the preparation of pro forma financial
statements (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be solely
responsible for the preparation of any such pro forma financial statements)
and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries included in any
offering memorandum, prospectus or other filing with the SEC or Canadian
provincial or territorial securities regulatory authorities; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section 7.19_), (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require
any cooperation to the extent that it would require the board of directors of
the Company or board of (managing) directors of any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives,
as applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, agree to pay any
commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time
or to approve the execution or delivery of any document or certificate in
connection with any financing, and (ii) no officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who is not an officer of the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to deliver any certificate in connection with any financing, other

connection with any consent or comfort letter to be provided pursuant to
clause (iv) above, and no counsel for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be obligated to deliver any opinion in connection with any financing;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that, irrespective of the above, no obligation of

instrument, other than customary certificates or representation letters to the
Companys accountant in connection with any consent or comfort letter to be
provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, shall be effective until the Effective
Time and none of the Company and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any certificate,
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing (including
entry into any agreement that is effective before the Effective Time) or that
would be effective prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 7.19_ to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability or commitment in connection with any financing prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company or promptly after

basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents from an
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with such obligations, in each case
other than to the extent any of the foregoing (x) arises from the bad faith,
gross negligence or intentional misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents or (y) arises from or relates
to information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates

condition set forth in clause (b) of Annex A as it applies to the Companys

the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event (A)
not later than the next Business Day following such termination in the case of
a termination by Parent and (B) prior to or simultaneously with the
termination in the case of a termination by the Company) pay to Parent, by

later than the next Business Day following such termination in the case of a
termination by the Company and (B) prior to or simultaneously with the
termination in the case of a termination by Parent) pay to the Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Companys
Reimbursable Expenses, which amount shall be fully creditable against the
Parent Termination Fee in the event such Parent Termination Fee becomes
payable pursuant to clause (ii) of this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.2(g)_, and (ii) if (A) from and after the date of this Agreement
and before such vote a Parent Takeover Proposal in respect of the Company has
been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the officers of Parent or
Parents board of directors and (B) Parent enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or there is consummated by Parent, a transaction in
connection with such Parent Takeover Proposal with the Person or group (or an

twelve months after such termination, then, on the earlier of the date of such
entering into a definitive agreement or consummation, Parent shall pay to the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Parent
Termination Fee. For purposes of this _Section 9.2(g)_ each reference to "30%
or more" in the definition of "Parent Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be

Section 9.3 _Matters Relating to Termination_.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to a termination under _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ or
_Section 9.1(f)_ that arises from the willful and material breach of this
Agreement or fraud by the Company, each of the Company and Parent acknowledges
and agrees that if Parent is entitled to receive and actually receives the
Company Termination Fee under this Agreement, Parents receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall constitute Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive
remedy for, and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of,
any termination of this Agreement regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to such termination.

 



 

(b) Except with respect to a termination under _Section 9.1(e)(i)_ or
_Section 9.1(h)_ that arises from the willful and material breach of this

actually receives the Parent Termination Fee under this Agreement, the

sole and exclusive remedy for, and such amount shall constitute liquidated
damages in respect of, any termination of this Agreement regardless of the

required to pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
_Section 9.2_ and this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable
under _Section 9.2_ do not constitute a penalty. If a party fails to pay as
directed in writing by the other party the termination fee due to such party
under _Section 9.2_ within the time periods specified in _Section 9.2_, the
party owing the termination fee shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel) incurred by
the other party in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ (or, if not reported therein, by
another authoritative source mutually agreed by the parties), calculated on a
daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date

Section 10.3 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
sections or subsections, such reference shall be to a section or subsection of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be
deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Disclosure Letters
and the Annexes hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
Any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter
forms. References

 



      
 

 



 

to "party" or "parties" in this Agreement mean the Company and/or Parent, as
the case may be. References to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to the
lawful currency of the United States of America and references to "CHF" in
this Agreement are to the lawful currency of Switzerland. References to any
agreement shall be deemed to include the exhibits, schedules and annexes to
such agreement, together with all amendments thereto. References to any Law
shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending,
replacing, supplementing or interpreting such Law. Time periods within or
following which any payment is to be made or act is to be done shall be
calculated by excluding the day on which the period commences and including
the day on which the period ends and by extending the period to the next
Business Day following if the last day of the period is not a Business Day.
Each section or subsection of a Disclosure Letter qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant of the
Agreement; _provided_ that information disclosed in one section or subsection
of a Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be included in each other section or
subsection of such Disclosure Letter in which the relevance of such
information would be reasonably apparent on the face thereof. Representations
and warranties in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ that are made in reference to
a partys Disclosure Letter or "in the case of" or "with respect to" a certain
party and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates are being made only by that party.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when each of the parties has delivered a signed
counterpart to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile transmission or electronic ".pdf" shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Annexes, the Parent Disclosure Letter and
the Company Disclosure Letter) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall terminate in accordance with its terms, or if the
Closing occurs, as set forth in _Section 10.2(b)_.

 



 

(b) This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (i) as set forth in or
contemplated by the terms and provisions of _Section 7.7_ and (ii) from and
after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of Company Common Shares to
receive the Merger Consideration set forth in _Article III_.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted
and construed with regard to, in all respects, including as to validity,
interpretation and effect, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws (other than those
provisions set forth herein that are required to be governed by the Laws of
Switzerland). The Merger Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted and
construed with regard to, in all respects, including as to validity,
interpretation and effect, the Laws of Switzerland, without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflict of laws.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
parties from realizing a material portion of the economic benefits of the
Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, which may be granted or withheld in the
sole discretion of the other parties. Any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Unless Parent makes a Consideration Mix Change pursuant to the
definition of "Cash Consideration" contained in this Agreement that prevents
the Offer and the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, no assignment or purported assignment
of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be valid if and to the extent such
assignment causes the Offer and the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that money damages would be both
incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that irreparable damage would
occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each of the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance, an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or
violations of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any Chosen Court, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Moreover, and
in recognition of the foregoing, each of the parties hereby waives (a) any
defense in any action for specific performance of this Agreement that a remedy
at law would be adequate or that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason and (b)
any requirement under any law for any party to post security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section 10.9_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally consents, agrees and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the U.S. Federal courts of the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (and appropriate appellate courts therefrom,
respectively) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any Action with
respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the Merger Agreement, which
shall be interpreted, construed, governed and enforced as set forth therein).
Each party agrees to commence any Action relating hereto only in the State of
Delaware, or if such Action may not be

 



      
 

 



 

brought in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in the other
appellate courts therefrom or other courts of the State of Delaware. Each
party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any Action with respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the
Merger Agreement, which shall be interpreted, construed, governed and enforced
as set forth therein) in the Chosen Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each party further irrevocably and unconditionally consents to and
grants any such court jurisdiction over the Person of such parties and, to the
extent legally effective, over the subject matter of any such dispute and
agrees that mailing of process or other documents in connection with any such
Action in the manner provided in _Section 10.2_ hereof or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
that after receipt of any such vote, no amendment shall be made which by Law
(or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or the TSX) requires approval by
shareholders of Parent or further approval by shareholders of the Company
without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties by their duly
authorized representatives.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the
parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any breach of the representations or warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which

 



      
 

 



 

given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.
