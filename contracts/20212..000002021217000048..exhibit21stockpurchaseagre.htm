Firm that, within five (5) days following its acceptance of its appointment as
the Accounting Firm, it shall deliver to the Seller and the Purchaser a

Accounting Firm. The Seller and the Purchaser will instruct the Accounting
Firm to limit its review and determination to those items set forth on the
Dispute Notice that remain in dispute and that relate to accounting matters,
and to deliver a written report containing its calculations of each such
disputed item. The final determination of the Accounting Firm will be made in
strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the definitions
of Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Cash, Selling Expenses and Closing
Indebtedness). The Accounting Firm will determine the items in dispute solely
based on written submissions made by the Seller and the Purchaser (and their
respective Representatives) consistent with the terms hereof, and not by
independent review. The Accounting Firm shall determine and report in writing
to the Seller and the Purchaser as to the resolution of all disputed matters
and the effect of such determinations on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
within sixty (60) days after the date on which such Accounting Firm is engaged
or such longer period as the Accounting Firm may reasonably require, and such
determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties, absent
manifest error, and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction. None of the Seller, the Purchaser, or their respective
Representatives will have any ex parte communications or meetings with the
Accounting Firm concerning the subject matter hereof without the prior written
consent of the other Party. The Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to
any disputed item that is greater than the greater value for such disputed
item claimed by either Party in its written submission or less than the lesser
value for such item claimed by either Party in its written submission. The
fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Party
(i.e., the Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand) that
assigned amounts to items in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in
amount from the amount finally determined by the Accounting Firm (or equally
in the event the Parties' assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far
from the amount finally determined by the Accounting Firm).

(d)Final Adjustment Statement. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall
become the "Final Adjustment Statement" and as such shall become final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties, absent manifest error, in the case of
clause (iii) below, for all purposes of this Agreement and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the
earliest to occur of the following:

(i)the mutual acceptance by the Seller and the Purchaser of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement, with such changes thereto, if any, as may be proposed by
the Seller and consented to by the Purchaser;

(ii)the expiration of thirty (30) days after the Seller's receipt of the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement, without timely written objection by the
Seller in accordance with Section 2.5(b); or

(iii)the delivery to the Seller and the Purchaser by the Accounting Firm of
the final report of its determination of all disputed matters submitted to the
Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.5(c).

(e)Adjustment of Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price, as finally determined
in accordance with this Section 2.5, is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to the
Seller an amount equal to such excess by wire transfer of immediately 

available funds to an account designated in writing by the Seller within three
(3) Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined. If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.5, is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Seller
shall pay the Purchaser an amount equal to such shortfall by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Purchaser within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Purchase
Price is finally determined. For tax purposes, any payment by the Purchaser or
the Seller under this Section 2.5 shall be treated as an adjustment to the

authorized to act on behalf of the Seller or any Affiliate, who might be
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All amounts required to be paid to Raine
Securities LLC shall be paid by the Seller.

4.6 Title to Shares. The Seller has good and valid title to all Shares, free
and clear of any Liens (other than restrictions on transfer under applicable
securities Laws), and is the record owner of all of the Shares. Other than
this Agreement, the Shares are not subject to any voting trust agreement or
other Contract restricting or otherwise addressing the voting, dividend rights
or disposition of the Shares. Upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser will acquire from the Seller
good and valid title to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than
restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws). 

4.7 Office Lease. The Office Lease is a legal, valid and binding Contract of
the Seller and is in full force and effect. Neither the Seller, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Seller any other party thereto, is in default or breach in
any material respect under the terms of the Office Lease. The Office Lease is
enforceable against the Seller, and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, each

4.8 Disclosure. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Seller, the
Seller (a) considers that all information in the Disclosure Schedules and in
the Company's electronic data room for the transactions contemplated hereby as
in existence as of 4:00 a.m., New York time on November 29, 2017 (the "Data
Room") was produced in good faith by the Company for the purpose of assisting
the Purchaser in its due diligence investigation and fairly disclosed all
information which the Company believes in good faith would be material to the
Purchaser in evaluating the Business, and (b) has not deliberately and
intentionally withheld information that would render such information
described in clause (a), when taken as a whole, materially untrue, inaccurate
or misleading in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
representation shall not apply to any financial projections or other forward-
looking information, whether included in the Data Room or otherwise provided
to the Purchaser orally or in writing. For purposes of the foregoing, the term
"fairly disclosed," means, in respect of any fact, matter or circumstance,
information that is disclosed in a manner such that a prudent person reviewing
the relevant materials with the assistance of qualified professional advisors
should have become aware of the existence of a risk to which a related loss is
attributable and of its order of magnitude taking into consideration the fact
that: (i) the Purchaser is a sophisticated buyer with resources and experience
to fully comprehend the Business and the industry and the markets in which the
Business operates, and to understand the risks and uncertainties inherent
therein, (ii) the documents contained in the Data Room were accessible by the
Purchaser continuously between September 11, 2017 and 4:00 a.m., New York time
on November 29, 2017 and (iii) the Purchaser and its advisors have had
opportunity to discuss and seek clarification from the Seller about any
matter, fact or circumstance in relation to the Business, including through
discussions with employees of the Seller and the Company.

THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR
THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY SUCH DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION SO
PROVIDED, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE III OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE OR OTHER INSTRUMENT
DELIVERED BY THE SELLER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASER IS RELYING
ONLY ON ITS OWN EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION THEREOF AS WELL AS THE

V. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

Except as disclosed in the correspondingly identified subsection of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Purchaser represents and warrants to the Seller and
the Company, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows: 

5.1 Organization. The Purchaser is duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing as a corporation under the Laws of Nevada, the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation. The Purchaser has the requisite corporate power
and authority, and any material Permits, consents and approvals required to
acquire, purchase and own the Shares and operate its business as currently
conducted. The Purchaser has made available to the Seller true and complete
copies of its Organizational Documents. The Purchaser is not in violation of
any provision of its Organizational Documents.

5.2 Authorization; Enforceability. The Purchaser has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under,
and consummate the transactions to be consummated by it under, this Agreement.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Purchaser of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions to be consummated by it hereunder have
been duly authorized; this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Purchaser; and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in
accordance with its terms subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

5.3 Non-Contravention; Consents.

(a)The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (i) violate the Organizational Documents of the Purchaser, (ii) materially
conflict with or violate in any material respect any applicable Law or Order
or (iii) materially conflict with or violate in any material respect the
Existing Credit Agreement.

(b)The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not require any Governmental Approval, except (i) applicable requirements, if
any, under federal or state securities or "blue sky" Laws, (ii) such filings
as may be required under the HSR Act, (iii) such antitrust, competition or
similar Governmental Approvals from non-United States Governmental
Authorities, if any and (iv) where the failure to make or obtain such filing
or notification with, or any clearance, authorization, approval, waiver, or
consent would not reasonably be expected to be (x) material to the Purchaser
or (y) materially adverse to the ability of the Purchaser to timely perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Outside Date (a "Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect").

5.4 Litigation. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Purchaser, threatened by, against or affecting the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser is not subject to or bound by any Order, in either case that would
challenge, prevent, delay or make illegal (a) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (b) the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or perform its obligations under this Agreement
to which the Purchaser is or will be a party.

5.5 Regulatory Matters. To the Knowledge of the Purchaser, as of the date
hereof, there are no facts with respect to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, that, if known to a Governmental Authority regulating Gaming
Approvals or Competition Filings, would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay (beyond customary response periods) the granting of any
Gaming Approvals or any clearances or approvals under the HSR Act or any
antitrust or competition law of any non-U.S. jurisdiction required to be
obtained by the Purchaser in order for the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions under this Agreement and to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

5.6 Finders' Fees. There is no investment banker, broker, finder, or other
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof, who might be entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for which the Seller or any of its Affiliates would be responsible. All
amounts required to be paid to any investment banker, 

broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the Purchaser.

5.7 Investment Intent. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own
account for investment purposes only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof or with any intention of selling, distributing or
otherwise disposing of the Shares in a manner that would violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Purchaser agrees that the
Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated
or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration under the Securities Act and such state securities Laws. The
Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for an
indefinite period of time (including total loss of its investment), and has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment.

5.8 Financing.

(a)The Purchaser has delivered to the Seller true and complete copies of (i)
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among, inter
alios, the Purchaser, UBS Securities LLC, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (the "Debt
Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the counterparties thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend to the
Purchaser and its Affiliated companies named as borrowers therein (the
"Affiliated Borrowers") the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt Financing")
and (iii) any fee letter in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Financing (any such fee letter, a "Fee Letter"), with the fee amounts,
pricing caps and the economic terms of the "flex" provisions contained therein
redacted and other customary redactions that do not materially adversely
affect the conditionality of the Debt Financing. The amounts expected to be
provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(a)) and cash on hand, will be
sufficient for the Purchaser, when required, to (A) pay the amounts described
in Section 2.4 in cash, including the Estimated Purchase Price, (B) pay any
and all fees and expenses required to be paid by the Purchaser at Closing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt
Financing and (C) satisfy all other payments required to be made by the
Purchaser hereunder at Closing (collectively, the "Financing Uses").

(b)As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other
Contracts or arrangements to which the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a
party related to the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is currently contemplated except
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, and the
commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect.

(c)As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Purchaser and the Affiliated Borrowers and, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser,
the other parties thereto, in each case subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as set
forth in, or contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
(the "Disclosed Conditions"). Other than the Disclosed Conditions, there are
no conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing
that would permit any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter
(other than the Purchaser and its Affiliates) to reduce the aggregate amount
available under the Debt Commitment Letter at Closing. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
8.1(a) hereof, (i) no event has occurred or circumstance 

exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute
a default or breach on the part of the Purchaser under the Debt Commitment
Letter or any related Fee Letter and (ii) the Purchaser has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will
not be made available to the Purchaser or its Affiliates on or prior to the
Closing Date. The Purchaser has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any
and all commitment fees or other fees which are due and payable on or prior to
the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter
and any related Fee Letter.

5.9 Purchaser's Investigation and Reliance. The Purchaser is a sophisticated
purchaser and has made its own investigation, review and analysis regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Seller and the transactions contemplated
hereby, together with the Representatives that they have engaged for such
purpose. The Purchaser and its Representatives have been provided reasonable
access to the Representatives, properties, offices and other facilities, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other necessary
information that they have requested in connection with their investigation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Purchaser acknowledges receipt of the Required Financial Information. The
Purchaser is not relying, and has not relied, upon any representation or
warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the Seller, the Company
or its Affiliates or Representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article
III, Article IV, the Disclosure Schedules or any certificate or other
instrument delivered by the Company or the Seller pursuant to this Agreement.
Neither the Seller nor the Company nor any of their Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any liability to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives resulting from the use of any information,
documents, or materials made available to the Purchaser, whether orally or in
writing, in any confidential information memoranda, "data rooms", "virtual
data rooms", management presentations, due diligence discussions or
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise covered in any
representation or warranty in Article III or Article IV, neither the Seller
nor the Company (nor any of their Affiliates or Representatives) is making,
directly or indirectly, any representation or warranty with respect to any
estimates, projections or forecasts involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including as contained in any information memorandum. The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that there are inherent uncertainties in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and forecasts and that it takes
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of any such estimates, projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections or forecasts).
Nothing in this Section 5.9 is intended to modify or limit any of the
representations or warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, of the
Seller in Article IV or of the Company or the Seller in any certificate or
instrument delivered by the Company or the Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

5.10 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified in
Article VIII and the accuracy of the Company's and the Seller's respective
representations and warranties herein, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Debt Financing, payment of all
amounts required to be paid on the Closing Date in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all
related fees and expenses, the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company), taken as a whole, will be Solvent at and immediately after the
Closing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" means that, as
of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the present fair saleable
value of the assets of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company), taken as a whole, will, as of such date, exceed the sum of their
recorded liabilities determined in accordance with GAAP (including contingent
liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP), (b) the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries (including the Company), taken as a whole, will not have,
as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to engage
in their respective businesses, and (c) the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company) will be able to pay their recorded liabilities
determined in accordance with GAAP (including contingent liabilities that
would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) as they mature. For 

purposes of this definition, "not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital with which to engage in their respective businesses" means
that the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Company), taken as a
whole, have enough cash to meet their respective obligations as they become
due.

VI. CERTAIN COVENANTS

6.1 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any Party
to this Agreement, the other Parties will execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as the requesting Party
may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in any such case, at the requesting Party's
sole cost and expense.

6.2 Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a)For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing, the Purchaser
agrees to cause the Company to indemnify (including advancement of expenses)
and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company
to the same extent such persons are indemnified by the Company as of the date
of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's Organizational Documents, any
applicable employment agreements or indemnification agreements or under
applicable Laws for acts or omissions which occurred at or prior to the
Closing. The provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation
contained in the Company's Organizational Documents shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years in any manner
that would materially adversely affect the rights of the past and present
officers and directors of the Company when compared to such provisions in the
Company's Organizational Documents in effect as of the date hereof.

(b)From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
for the Company's and its Subsidiaries' directors and officers, which shall
provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following
the Closing of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms
not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company;
provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section
6.2(b), the Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount per annum that the Company (or
the Seller or any of its Affiliates on behalf of the Company) paid in its most
recent renewal period (for the time period from August 1, 2017 to August 1,
2018) as set forth in Schedule 6.2(b) (the "Current Premium") and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the Current Premium, then the Purchaser shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance that, in the Purchaser's good faith judgment, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium not in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the Current Premium. The Purchaser shall pay any
applicable premiums for such insurance.

(c)If the Purchaser, the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.2.

(d)The provisions of this Section 6.2 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, all past and present officers and directors of the
Company and his or her heirs and representatives. The rights of all past and
present officers and directors of the Company under this Section 6.2 

are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract,
applicable Laws or otherwise.

6.3 Conduct of Business of the Company. During the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and the Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and each
such Subsidiary to, (1) conduct the Company's operations and the Business only
in the Ordinary Course, in substantially the same manner as heretofore
conducted, including its practices relating to the offering of sales
promotions with respect to any of the Company's games, (2) use reasonable
efforts to keep in full force and effect all Policies on their respective
coverages and terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, other than
such policies that expire by their terms (in which event the Seller, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall use reasonable
efforts to renew or replace such Policies with policies that have coverages
and terms materially consistent with those of the related Policy as of the
date of this Agreement), (3) use reasonable efforts to preserve intact the
Company's current business organization, and maintain its relations and
goodwill with all suppliers, customers, landlords, creditors, merchants and
other Persons having material business relationships with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than terminations of employees following reasonable
consultation with the Purchaser) and (4) spend on user acquisition costs an
amount per month (without pro-ration for partial months) per category of game
(social casino or casual or mid-core free-to-play) within the percentage range
set forth on Schedule 6.3(A) for such category, other than in circumstances
where the Seller believes this amount would not optimize the financial
performance of the Business, in which case the Seller shall seek the
Purchaser's consent to spend a lower amount for such month. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period, with respect
to the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Business, none of the Seller, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall:

(a)sell, issue or authorize the issuance of: (i) any capital stock or other

Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Seller, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives receives an
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group relating to any
transaction other than an Acquisition Transaction, including a sale, purchase,
merger, consolidation, combination or other transaction involving the Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (a
"Separate Proposal"), then the Seller, the Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries, their respective boards of directors or their respective
Representatives, as applicable, may (i) furnish any information and other
access to any Person making such Separate Proposal and any of its
Representatives, (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
making such Separate Proposal and any of its Representatives or (iii) enter
into any transaction relating to such Separate Proposal; provided, that prior
to engaging in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing any
information to, any such Person or its Representatives, the Seller shall have
received an agreement in writing from such Person making the Separate Proposal
that the Seller continues to be bound by the terms of this Agreement,
including this Section 6.4; provided, further, that if (1) any information
related to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective assets, operations
or businesses (including the Business) or the Product is furnished to such
Person making the Separate Proposal or any of its Representatives, such Person
and its Representatives shall be subject to a confidentiality agreement with
respect to such information containing confidentiality obligations customary
for such transaction and (2) the Separate Proposal relates only to any of the
Seller's Affiliates (or any portion thereof) and not to an acquisition of the
Seller, no information related to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their
respective assets, operations or businesses (including the Business) or the
Product shall be provided to the Person making the Separate Proposal or its
Representatives.

(b)The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company),
and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
terminate any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person other than
the Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives, and any other activities
of a type that would be prohibited by Section 6.4(a), theretofore conducted by
the Seller, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives with respect to
an Acquisition Transaction or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Transaction. Promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business
Days, following the date hereof, the Seller shall revoke or cause to be
revoked access to any electronic data room for the transactions contemplated
hereby to all third parties (other than the Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) and use reasonable best efforts to cause all
non-public information previously provided by or on behalf of it or any of its
Affiliates to any such third party to be returned or destroyed in accordance
with the applicable confidentiality agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Transaction" means proposal or offer from any Person or group
(other than the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) relating to (i) any
purchase, issuance or sale or other disposition of any equity securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any purchase, license, lease,
sale or other disposition of any material assets (or more than ten percent
(10%) of the total assets) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether

merger, consolidation, recapitalization, joint venture, partnership, tender
offer or other business combination involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise involving any material assets (or more than ten
percent (10%) of the assets) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(c)The Seller shall ensure that each of its Affiliates, and its and their
respective Representatives, are aware of the provisions of this Section 6.4,
and the Seller hereby agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach of
this Section 6.4 arising out of the activities of such Affiliates or
Representatives.

6.5 Regulatory Filings.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the date of
this Agreement to the Closing, or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be
filed, all documents, to give or cause to be given all notices under
applicable Laws, to obtain or cause to be obtained all authorizations,
consents, waivers, approvals, permits or orders under applicable Laws or from
other Persons, and to do or cause to be done all other things necessary,
proper or advisable, in order to consummate and make effective as promptly as
possible the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, subject
to the terms and conditions herein, no Party (nor any of their respective
Affiliates) shall take any action after the date hereof without the consent of
the other Parties that could reasonably be expected to delay the obtaining of,
or result in not obtaining, any authorization, consent, waiver, approval,
permit or order from any Governmental Authority or other Person required to be
obtained prior to the Closing.

(b)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties shall
cause to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority no later than
ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, the appropriate notification
and report forms and accompanying materials due from each Party under the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Competition
Filings"). The Parties shall request early termination of the HSR waiting
period. Subject to applicable Law and reasonable confidentiality
considerations, the Parties shall collaborate with each other in the
preparation and submission of their respective Competition Filings. The
Purchaser shall pay all administrative filing fees associated with the
Competition Filings.

(c)The Parties shall respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or
requests received from a Governmental Authority for additional information or
documentary material relating to the Competition Filings. Each Party shall,
subject to the applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, (i)
promptly inform each other Party of any communication to or from any
Governmental Authority regarding the Competition Filings or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) give each other Party prompt notice of the
commencement of any investigation or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Competition Filings or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) keep each other Party informed as
to the status of any such investigation or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall
provide to the other Parties in advance, with a reasonable opportunity for
review and comment, drafts of communications to be submitted to a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Competition Filings or relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall consider in good faith each
other's comments on those drafts; provided, that each Party may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, (i) reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material contained in any Competition Filing that is provided to the other as
"outside counsel only" with any such competitively sensitive material given
only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and not disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the providing party, or (ii)
redact from any Competition Filing any information that is not customarily
exchanged between parties to such Competition Filing. Each Party shall give
the other Parties advance notice of any meeting or conference with a
Governmental Authority relating to the Competition Filings or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be prohibited by a Governmental
Authority, shall permit Representatives of the other Parties to be present at
those meetings or conferences. 

(d)Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to effectuate as promptly as practicable the Closing and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Party shall use reasonable best efforts (i)
to have the waiting period under the HSR Act expire or be terminated; and (ii)
to prevent, avoid or lift, by litigation or otherwise, any restraint,
prohibition, injunction, delay, limitation, or other legal bar to the Closing
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.6 Restrictive Covenants.

(a)The Seller agrees that, for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries will (i) solicit for employment or any similar
arrangement any Continuing Employee or (ii) hire or assist any other Person in
hiring any Continuing Employee; provided, however, that this Section 6.6(a)
shall not (x) apply to Continuing Employees whose employment with the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) is terminated by
the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate without cause or is terminated by
the employee for good reason or (y) prohibit general solicitations by the
Seller for employment through advertisements or other means or engaging search
firms for such purposes that are not specifically targeted or directed at
Continuing Employees, so long as (A) with respect to Continuing Employees in
the categories set forth in Schedule 6.6, during the three (3) year period
after the Closing Date and (B) with respect to all other Continuing Employees,
during the one (1) year period after the Closing Date, the Seller and its
Affiliates shall not hire or retain such Continuing Employees who respond to
such general advertisement or solicitations for employment or from such search
firm.

(b)The Seller agrees that, for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries will engage, directly or indirectly, in any Restricted
Activity. For the purposes of this Agreement, a Person shall be deemed to
engage in a "Restricted Activity" if such Person owns, operates, manages,
controls, engages in, participates in, invests in, permits such Person's name
to be used by, or acts as a consultant, advisor or licensor to a business that
engages in the Ongoing Business. For the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) Real
Money Gaming, (2) any activity of the Seller and its Subsidiaries for which
the customer cannot pay, barter or otherwise transfer cash or cash equivalents
with respect to such activity, (3) any activity of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries related to live or replayed historical horse races or virtual
horse races through any medium, or (4) the Seller's and its Subsidiaries'
continued participation in its business operations existing as of the date of
this Agreement (other than the Business) shall constitute, nor be deemed to
constitute, a Restricted Activity. For purposes of this Agreement, "Real Money
Gaming" means any wagering activity in any form (including poker, slot machine
or casino table games, lottery, sports betting, sports wagering, bingo,
fantasy sports (season-long and daily), pari-mutuel wagering in any form,
skill-based games or any other wagering activity or through any medium
(including land-based, mobile-based or internet) that provides to a player
engaging in such wagering activity the opportunity to receive the payment of
cash or anything else that can be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents (e.g.,
vouchers for future wagers or other complimentary non-virtual goods or
services)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.6(b)
shall prohibit the Seller or any of its Affiliates from (i) being a passive
owner of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly
traded company that, directly or indirectly, engages in a Restricted Activity,
(ii) a business activity that is carried on by any third Person that is
acquired by or combined with the Seller or any of its Affiliates after the
date hereof (whether through a merger, consolidation, acquisition or other
business combination), and after such acquisition or combination, owning an
interest in any other Person (or its successor) that is engaged, directly or
indirectly, in the Ongoing Business if such business generated less than ten
percent (10%) of such Person's aggregate consolidated EBITDA in the last
completed fiscal year prior to such acquisition or combination, (iii) engaging
in any business activity that would otherwise violate this Section 

6.6(b) that is acquired from any Person (an "After-Acquired Business") or is
carried on by any Person that is acquired by or combined with the Seller or
one of its Subsidiaries in each case after the Closing Date (an "After-
Acquired Company"), so long as within one hundred and eighty (180) days after
such acquisition of the After-Acquired Business or the After-Acquired Company,
the Seller or the applicable Subsidiary signs a definitive agreement to
divest, and within one hundred and eighty (180) days after signing such
definitive agreement, subsequently divests, the relevant portion of the
business or securities of the After-Acquired Business or the After-Acquired
Company, or at the expiration of such first one hundred and eighty (180) days
period, the business of the After-Acquired Business or the After-Acquired
Company complies with this Section 6.6(b), (iv) entering into any joint
venture with any Person that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in the
Ongoing Business, so long as the joint venture does not engage in the Ongoing
Business, (v) subject to clause (i) above, making any equity investment in any
Person (A) in which the Seller and its Affiliates collectively hold not more
than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding voting securities or similar equity
interests or (B) in which the aggregate annual EBITDA from the Ongoing
Business of the entity in which the equity is held is less than $5,000,000, in
each case where the Seller and its Affiliates do not have an active role in
the management of the day-to-day operations of the business conducted by such
entity or (vi) distributing, marketing or selling any products or services,
other than products or services of the Company or products or services
described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of "Ongoing Business"
herein, that are being distributed, marketed or sold by the Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) as of the date of
this Agreement and any products or services developed in the future by the
Seller or such Affiliates derived therefrom or that are natural extensions
thereof; provided that such future developed products or services are not of
the type developed or exploited by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement or described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of "Ongoing
Business" herein.

6.7 Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

(a)The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate to give notice jointly to all
Company employees prior to the Closing Date that the active participation of
the Company employees in the Seller Plans shall terminate as of the Closing
Date. In no event shall any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
be entitled to accrue any benefits under the Seller Plans with respect to
services rendered or compensation paid on and after the Closing Date.

(b)The Purchaser and each Company Plan which is a health plan shall be
responsible for providing any participant in such Company Plan (and such
employees' "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of
the Code) who has a "qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f)
of the Code (or similar local Law) ("COBRA"), on or after the Closing Date
with the continuation of group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of
the Code (or similar local Law) to the extent required by Law.

(c)For at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
provide or cause to be provided to all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "Continuing Employees") (i) a rate of
base salary, wages, bonus opportunity and other cash compensation that is not
less favorable than the rate of base salary, wages, bonus opportunity and
other cash compensation paid by the Company or its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) other benefits that are either
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided by the Company
or its Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding equity or
equity-based awards and nonqualified deferred compensation) or substantially
similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided by the Purchaser and its
Affiliates to their employees generally who are similarly situated to such
Continuing Employees.

(d)Following the Closing Date, (i) the Purchaser shall take reasonable steps
to ensure, or cause to ensure, that no limitations or exclusions as to pre-
existing conditions, evidence of insurability or 

good health, waiting periods or actively-at-work exclusions or other
limitations or restrictions on coverage are applicable to any Continuing
Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans
in which such Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries may be
eligible to participate and (ii) the Purchaser shall take reasonable steps to
provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred by
Continuing Employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) up to (and
including) the Closing Date shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any
such welfare benefit plans.

(e)With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice, including
severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored
or maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company
following the Closing), the Purchaser shall grant, or cause to be granted to,
all Continuing Employees from and after the Closing Date credit for all
service with the Company and its predecessors prior to the Closing Date to the
extent recognized under the applicable Plan for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence benefits, benefit accrual
and severance, but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan and any such credit that would result in a duplication of benefits.

(f)The Purchaser agrees that it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not
to, cause any of the Continuing Employees to suffer an "employment loss,"
"plant closing," "mass layoff," or "relocation," for purposes of the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") or the California
WARN Act (Cal. Labor Code Sec. 1400 et seq.) (collectively "Workforce
Reductions") if such Workforce Reductions would create, or would reasonably be
expected to create, any liability for the Seller or its Affiliates under the
WARN Act or any similar state or local Law, to the extent that, on the Closing
Date, the Seller provides the Purchaser with a list of all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who have suffered a Workforce Reduction within
six months before the Closing Date. The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for all Liabilities under the WARN Act, the California WARN Act,
and any similar state or local Law resulting from the Closing or from the
actions of the Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing.

(g)Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Article VI, the Seller
shall retain all Liabilities relating to all Seller Plans. Effective as of the
Closing, the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall assume and
retain all Liabilities relating to all Company Plans.

(h)Nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to continue the
employment of any Continuing Employee for any definite period following the
Closing Date, and nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Purchaser or
the Company from altering, amending, or terminating any of its employee
benefit plans, or the participation of any of its employees in such plans, at
any time. This Agreement shall not amend any plans or arrangements or create
any rights or obligations except between the Parties hereto. No Continuing
Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any of its
current of former Affiliates including any beneficiary or dependent thereof,
or any other person not a party to this Agreement shall be entitled to assert
any claim hereunder.

(i)Before the Closing Date, the Seller shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) assign to the Purchaser all of the Seller's (or its Subsidiary's) rights
under all restrictive covenant agreements (including any non-competition, non-
solicitation, confidentiality, and nondisclosure agreements) between the
Seller (or any of its Subsidiaries other than the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries) and current or former employees or non-employee service
providers of the Company. 

(j)On or before the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause all restrictions with
respect to restricted stock awards held by Continuing Employees to lapse and
shall take such other actions as may be necessary to prevent the forfeiture of
such awards in connection with the termination of the Continuing Employees
employment with the Seller and its Subsidiaries upon such Continuing Employee
delivering to the Seller a customary release for such action.

(k)The Seller shall coordinate with the senior management of the Company and
use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain retention agreements from the
individuals identified to the Seller by the Purchaser prior to the Closing.

(l)The Seller shall take action to cause the 2005 Churchill Downs Incorporated
Deferred Compensation Plan (as Amended as of December 1, 2008) (the "DCP") to
be terminated with respect to all participants who are Company employees
effective as of the Closing Date (the "DCP Participants") and shall pay out
all amounts accrued by the DCP Participants under the DCP as of such date. In
addition, the Seller shall take action to terminate the arrangements set forth
on Schedule 6.7(l) effective as of the Closing Date and shall pay out all
amounts due thereunder as of such date.

6.8 Access to Information.

(a)Subject to Section 6.8(b), during the Pre-Closing Period, upon reasonable
prior notice, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to (i) afford the Representatives of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the senior
management and advisors of the Company, and the properties, books and records,
Tax Returns, work papers and other documents and information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to the Representatives of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates such additional financial and operating
data and other information regarding the Company as the Purchaser, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives may from time to time
reasonably request for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated
hereby and preparing to own the Shares and operate the Business following the
Closing. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser or its Affiliates may,
in the Ordinary Course of their business and following reasonable advance
notice to the Company, make inquiries of Persons having business relationships
with any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including suppliers,
licensors, distributors and customers) with whom the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates has a separate business relationship, as long as such inquiries
regard matters unrelated to and separate from the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.8 to the contrary,

i.(A) in no event shall the Seller, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
their respective Affiliates be obligated to provide any (1) access or
information in violation of any applicable Law, (2) information with respect
to bids, the identity of any bidder, confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreements, letters of intent, expressions of interest or other proposals
received prior to the date hereof in connection with transactions comparable
to those contemplated by this Agreement or any information or analysis
relating to any such communications, (3) information the disclosure of which
would jeopardize any applicable privilege (including the attorney-client
privilege) available to the Seller, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
their respective Affiliates relating to such information or (4) information
the disclosure of which would cause the Seller, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates to breach a
confidentiality obligation to which it is bound; provided, that, in the case
of clauses (A)(1), (A)(3) and (A)(4), the Seller, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents and take such other
reasonable action (such as the entry into a joint defense agreement or other
arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-client privilege) to permit such access; 

and (B) such investigation or access shall not unreasonably interfere with any
of the businesses, personnel or operations of the Seller, the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates;

ii.the auditors and accountants of the Seller, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates shall not be obligated to
make any work papers available to any Person pursuant to this Section 6.8
except in accordance with such auditors' and accountants' normal disclosure
procedures and then only after such Person has signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such auditors or accountants; and

iii.before the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Seller, which
the Seller may withhold for any reason, neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Representatives shall contact any employees of, suppliers to, or customers of,
the Seller, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, or to otherwise discuss the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that nothing in
this Section 6.8(b)(iii) is intended to limit the Purchaser's rights under
Section 6.8(a).

(c)If so requested by the Seller, the Purchaser shall enter into a customary
joint defense agreement or common interest agreement with the Seller, the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates with
respect to any information provided to the Purchaser, or to which the
Purchaser gains access, pursuant to this Section 6.8.

(d)In addition to the provisions of Section 6.9, from and after the Closing
Date, in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, financial statements,
audits, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or regulatory reporting
obligations, support for Legal Proceedings other than those between the Seller
or any of its Affiliates and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries) and compliance with applicable Law, upon
reasonable prior notice, and except that neither the Seller nor the Purchaser
shall be required to provide any access or information to the extent that
restricting such access or information is necessary, in such Party's
reasonable opinion, to (A) ensure compliance with any applicable Law, (B)
preserve any applicable privilege (including the attorney-client privilege),
(C) protect the Business (in the case of the Purchaser) or its business (in
the case of the Seller) from competitive harm, or (D) comply with any
contractual confidentiality obligations, the Seller and the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including in the case of the
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries), and their respective
Representatives to (i) afford the Representatives of the other Party and its
Affiliates reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the properties,
key employees, books and records, Tax Returns and work papers of such Party
and its Subsidiaries (including in the case of the Purchaser, the Company and
its Subsidiaries), (ii) furnish to the Representatives of such Party and its
Affiliates such additional financial and other information regarding the
Seller or the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, in
each case, their respective Affiliates as such Party or its Representatives
may from time to time reasonably request and (iii) make available to
Representatives of such Party or its Affiliates its and its Affiliates'
employees whose assistance, expertise, testimony, notes or recollections or
presence may be necessary to assist such Party or its Affiliates in connection
with its inquiries for any of the purposes referred to above, including the
presence of such persons as witnesses in hearings or trials for such purposes;
provided, however, that such investigation or access shall be conducted under
the supervision of the applicable Party's or its Affiliates' personnel and
shall not interfere with the business or operations of such Party or any of
its Affiliates (including, in the case of the Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries); and provided, further, that the auditors and accountants of
such Party or its Affiliates (including, in the case of the Purchaser, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to any Person except in accordance with such auditors' and
accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Person has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or accountants. If so
requested by the Purchaser, on 

the one hand, or the Seller or one of its Affiliates, on the other hand, the
Seller or one of its Affiliates, or the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, as
the case may be, shall enter into a customary joint defense agreement or
common interest agreement with the Purchaser and its Affiliates, or the Seller
and its Affiliates, as applicable, with respect to any information to be
provided to the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.8(d).

6.9 Preservation of Books and Records. The Seller and its Affiliates shall
have the right to retain copies of books and records of the Company relating
to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent necessary to
comply with applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.9,
in order to comply with its obligations under Section 6.8(d), the Purchaser
agrees that it shall preserve and keep, or cause to be preserved and kept, all
original books and records in respect of the Company in the possession of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates reasonably expected to be needed in connection
with the preparation of Tax Returns, financial statements, audits, U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or regulatory reporting obligations,
support for Legal Proceedings other than those between the Seller or any of
its Affiliates and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and compliance with applicable Law, for the
longer of (i) any applicable statute of limitations and (ii) a period of six
(6) years from the Closing Date. During such six (6) year or longer period,
Representatives of the Seller and its Affiliates shall, upon reasonable notice
and in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, financial statements,
audits, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or regulatory reporting
obligations, support for Legal Proceedings other than those between the Seller
or any of its Affiliates and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries) and compliance with applicable Law, have
access during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy such books
and records; provided, however, that the Seller shall not have such access to
such books and records to the extent that restricting such access or
information is necessary, in the Purchaser's reasonable opinion, to (A) ensure
compliance with any applicable Law, (B) preserve any applicable privilege
(including the attorney-client privilege), or (C) comply with any contractual
confidentiality obligations; provided, that the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain necessary consents from third
parties to allow the Purchaser to provide the Seller with such access or
information that would be restricted by this clause (C). The Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall return any original books and records it
obtained pursuant to Section 6.8(d) or this Section 6.9 to the Purchaser or
such Affiliate as soon as such books and records are no longer needed in
connection with the applicable circumstances described in the immediately
preceding sentence. After such six (6) year or longer period, before the
Purchaser or any Affiliate shall intentionally dispose of any of such books
and records, the Purchaser shall give at least sixty (60) days' prior written
notice of such intention to dispose to the Seller, and the Seller or any of
its Affiliates shall be given an opportunity, at their cost and expense, to
remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as it may elect.
If so requested by the Purchaser, any of the Seller or its applicable
Affiliate to which the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates is providing
information pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall enter into a customary joint
defense agreement with the Purchaser or such Affiliate with respect to any
information to be provided to the Seller or its Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 6.9.

6.10 Insurance. For events arising from the operation of the business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by the Seller's or its Subsidiaries'
insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs, and neither the
Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries shall have any access, right, title or interest
to or in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and rights to
make claims and all rights to proceeds). The Seller or its Subsidiaries may
amend any insurance policies to the extent necessary to effectuate the
preceding sentence, with any such amendments to be effective as of the
Closing. For a period of four (4) years after the Closing, with respect to any
occurrence-based insurance policy under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is an insured, the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, may make claims under such policies (to the extent of coverage and
subject to any policy limits) with respect to events taking place prior to the
Closing 

in respect of the Business and the operations and Liabilities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any such past or current insurance policy;
provided, however, that by making any such claims, the Purchaser agrees to
reimburse the Seller for any increased costs incurred by the Seller directly
as a result of such claims, including any retroactive or prospective premium
adjustments as such amounts are determined in accordance with the policies;
and provided, further, that the Purchaser shall exclusively bear (and the
Seller shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse the Purchaser for) the
amount of any "deductibles" associated with claims under such policies and
shall be liable for all uninsured or uncovered amounts of such claims. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall retain all rights to control its
insurance policies, including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute,
buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance
policies, notwithstanding whether any such policies apply to any Liabilities
of the Purchaser under this Section 6.10 or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.10 is intended to modify or limit any of
the Seller's obligations, or any of the Purchaser's rights, under Section 6.14
or Article IX.

6.11 Financing.

(a)The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary or advisable to obtain the Debt
Financing as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, not later than
the Closing Date, on substantially the terms and conditions (including, to the
extent applicable, the "flex" provisions), taken as a whole, described in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on substantially the terms and conditions (as such terms may be
modified or adjusted (x) in accordance with the terms, and within the limits,
of the flex provisions contained in any Fee Letter or (y) in accordance with
the restrictions on amendments and modifications set forth in the immediately
succeeding sentence) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the
related Fee Letter (the "Definitive Debt Financing Agreements") and (ii)
satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions and
covenants (including with respect to the payment of any ticking, commitment,
engagement or placement fees) applicable to and within the control of the
Purchaser or the Affiliated Borrowers in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. The Purchaser shall not
agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter
or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the prior written consent
of the Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such amendment, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the
aggregate amount (other than immaterial reductions) of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing or similar fee) to an amount that (when
combined with any equity financing and cash on hand) is less than the amount
needed to satisfy the Financing Uses, (B) impose new or additional conditions,
or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the
Debt Financing or (C) otherwise amend, modify or waive any other provision of
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements, in each case of the foregoing clauses (B) and (C), only if in a
manner that would (x) materially delay or prevent the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing)
on the Closing Date, (y) materially adversely impact the ability of the
Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or (z)
materially adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that any
amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements for the purpose of (I) adding lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter as of the date hereof or (II)
extending the termination date set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter shall
be permitted without the prior written consent of the Seller). Upon any
amendment, modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in accordance with this Section 6.11(a),
the terms "Debt Commitment Letter", "Fee Letter" and 

"Definitive Debt Financing Agreements" shall include and mean such documents
as amended, modified or waived in accordance with this Section 6.11(a) and the
term "Debt Financing", shall include and mean the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter as amended, modified or waived in accordance with
this Section 6.11(a).

(b)The Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Seller,
prior to or in connection with the Closing, permit or arrange any debt
financing to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be a party
prior to the Closing or by which any of their respective assets shall be
subject or bound prior to the Closing, other than the Debt Financing. If any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the related Fee Letter, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event
but no later than the Closing Date required by Section 2.2, arrange and obtain
from the same or alternative sources of debt financing an amount, when
combined with any equity financing and cash on hand, sufficient to satisfy the
Financing Uses, on terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that
are not materially less favorable to the Purchaser in the aggregate as those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter and which
shall not include any conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of
such alternative debt financing on the Closing Date that are materially more
onerous than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee
Letter in effect on the date hereof. The new debt commitment letter and fee
letter entered into in connection with such alternative debt financing are
referred to, respectively, as a "New Debt Commitment Letter" and a "New Fee
Letter." The Purchaser shall provide the Company with (x) a copy of the New
Debt Commitment Letter and related New Fee Letter (with the fee amounts,
pricing caps and the economic terms of the "flex" provisions contained therein
redacted and other customary redactions that do not materially adversely
affect the conditionality of such alternative debt financing) for any such
alternative debt financing for its review prior to the execution thereof and
(y) fully executed copies thereof (which may be redacted as aforesaid) as
promptly as practicable following the execution thereof. In the event the
Purchaser enters into any such New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter,
(i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the
debt financing contemplated by the "Debt Commitment Letter" as such term is
modified pursuant to the immediately succeeding clause (ii), (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letter," including the
definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include
the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter
to the extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Fee Letter" (and any definition incorporating the term "Fee Letter,"
including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be
deemed to include the Fee Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Fee
Letter at the time in question and any New Fee Letter to the extent then in
effect.

(c)The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep the
Seller informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall (i) furnish the Seller complete, correct
and executed copies of any amendments to the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letter (with the fee amounts, pricing caps and the economic terms of the
"flex" provisions contained therein redacted and other customary redactions
that do not materially adversely affect the conditionality of the Debt
Financing) promptly upon their execution and (ii) give the Seller prompt
written notice (A) of any default or breach (or any event that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would give rise to any default or
breach) by any party under any of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter
or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements of which the Purchaser becomes
aware, (B) of any termination of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter, (C) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (1) material
default or breach, or any actual or threatened termination or repudiation, 

of any of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letters, any Definitive Debt
Financing Agreement or any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, in each case by any party
thereto, or (2) any material dispute or disagreement relating to the Financing
between or among the Purchaser and/or the Affiliated Borrowers, on the one
hand, and the Debt Financing Sources, on the other hand, and (D) if for any
reason the Purchaser believes in good faith that it or the Affiliated
Borrowers will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing
needed to satisfy the Financing Uses on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, as the case may be; provided, that the
Purchaser shall not be under any obligation to disclose any information that
(x) is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such
privilege is asserted in good faith or (y) otherwise would violate or
contravene any Law or any obligation of confidentiality (it being understood
that in the case of this clause (y), the Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to notify the Seller of such restriction and communicate any such
information in a way that does not cause such a violation).

(d)The Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, and instruct the
management of the Business (having appropriate seniority and expertise), to,
in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide to the Purchaser,
its Affiliates, their respective Representatives and the Debt Financing
Sources all customary cooperation reasonably requested by the Purchaser, its
Affiliates, their respective Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources in
connection with the Debt Financing and any syndication thereof, including
reasonable best efforts to (i) participate by phone in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, sessions with rating agencies and due diligence
sessions, (ii) provide reasonable and customary assistance with the
preparation of materials (including projections) for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda and other similar documents for the
Debt Financing and provide reasonable cooperation with the due diligence
efforts of any sources of financing to the extent reasonable and customary
(including executing customary authorization letters authorizing the
distribution of information about the Company and its Subsidiaries to
prospective sources of financing, which letters shall include, to the extent
accurate and applicable, in the case of the public-side version of any such
materials and documents, a representation that such public-side version does
not include material non-public information about the Company or its
Subsidiaries), (iii) to the extent timely requested, (A) obtain documents
reasonably requested by the Purchaser, its Affiliates, their respective
Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources relating to (x) the release and
termination of liens and guarantees under the Seller's senior secured credit
facility and/or indentures, as applicable, and (y) the repayment of the
existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the release and
termination of related liens and guarantees, including customary payoff
letters and (B) provide, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, its Affiliates, their respective Representatives or any of the Debt
Financing Sources at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the aforementioned
date of delivery, (iv) furnish the Purchaser, its Affiliates, their respective
Representatives and the Debt Financing Sources with financial and other
pertinent information, including historical financial statements (and
assisting in the preparation of pro forma financial statements), regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to consummate the Debt
Financing (which, in the case of historical financial statements, shall be
limited to the Required Financial Information and Additional Required
Financial Information, as applicable), (v) execute and deliver as of the
Closing any pledge and security documents, guarantees, hedging agreements and
other definitive financing documents and other certificates or documents
(other than any solvency certificate) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any assets and property of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser, its Affiliates, their
respective Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources and otherwise
cooperate to facilitate the guaranteeing of obligations and the pledging of,
granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of 

any liens on, collateral in connection with the Debt Financing, (vi) use
reasonable best efforts to (A) permit the prospective sources of financing to
evaluate the current assets and liabilities, cash management and accounting
systems, and policies and procedures relating thereto of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, for purposes of establishing collateral arrangements, and (B) to
the extent required by the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, establish
bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox
arrangements in connection with the foregoing, and (vii) take all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably necessary or
advisable to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be available as of the Closing; provided, however, that
(1) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the ongoing business or operations of the Seller
or the Company and its Subsidiaries, (2) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any action that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing,
(3) neither the Seller's board of directors nor any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries' boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall be required to
approve or adopt any Debt Financing or agreements related thereto prior to the
Closing, (4) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to execute
any agreements or certificates in connection with any Debt Financing prior to
the Closing that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing (other
than customary authorization letters described in Section 6.11(d)(ii) above),
(5) the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the contents (other than
historical information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which shall be
limited to the Required Financial Information and the Additional Required
Financial Information, as applicable) and determination of pro forma financial
information, including pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization or
other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma
financial information or (6) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action that will conflict with or violate any
applicable Organizational Documents of the Company or such Subsidiary (as the
case may be) or any applicable Law or result in any officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability with
respect to any matters relating to the Debt Financing. Neither the Company nor
its Subsidiaries shall be required to, prior to the Closing or with respect to
any event or circumstances occurring or existing prior to the Closing, pay any
commitment fee or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by the
Purchaser as provided below in this Section 6.11(d)) or incur any other
liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Debt Financing or any of the foregoing. The Purchaser shall, promptly upon
request by the Seller and receipt of an invoice therefor from the Seller,
reimburse the Seller for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the cooperation required by this
Section 6.11(d). The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller,
the Company, and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with any action taken by them in accordance with this Section
6.11(d) (other than (i) with respect to any information provided by any of
them in connection with this Section 6.11(d) or (ii) to the extent arising
from the fraud, gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material
breach of this Agreement on the part of the Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives). The Seller and
the Company hereby consent to the use of each of the logos and other
trademarks of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt
Financing, provided that such logos and other trademarks are used in a manner
that is not intended nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(e)The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the
Debt Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing, and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing. 

(f)For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligations contained in this
Section 6.11 shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing.

6.12 Affiliate Transactions. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Company,
as applicable, shall pay in full all amounts owing through the Closing by or
to the Seller, any Affiliate of the Seller, any director or officer of the
Seller or any Subsidiary of the Seller, or any Associate of any such director
or officer (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on the one hand, to
or by, as applicable, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, and the Company and the Seller, as applicable, shall terminate or shall
cause to be terminated (with no payment obligations surviving such
termination) each Contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the Seller, any Subsidiary of the Seller, any director or
officer of the Seller or any Subsidiary of the Seller, or any Associate of any
such director or officer (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, except for those Contracts listed in Section 6.12 of the
Disclosure Schedules. For purposes of this Agreement, "Associate" means, with
respect to any person, (a) the spouse of such person, or any relative of such
person who has the same home as such person, (b) any corporation or other
business organization of which such person is an officer or is the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent (10%) or more of any class of
equity securities, and (c) any trust or estate in which such person has a
substantial beneficial interest or as to which such person serves as a trustee
or in a similar capacity.

6.13 Office Lease. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall effect the
Intended Occupant Assignment (as defined in the Office Lease) and shall notify
the Purchaser that the Intended Occupant Assignment has taken place prior to
the earlier of (a) two (2) Business Days after its effectiveness and (b) the
Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
landlord under the Office Lease (the "Landlord") the release of the Seller
from any and all obligations and liabilities under the Office Lease effective
as of the Closing (the "Office Lease Release"). The Seller hereby acknowledges
and agrees that obtaining the Office Lease Release is not a condition to
Closing. If requested by the Landlord, the Purchaser agrees to (i) (A) execute
a guaranty or (B) cause a Successor Guarantor to execute a guaranty (a
"Substitute Guaranty") in order to secure such Office Lease Release and (ii)
provide all documentation as may be reasonably required for the Seller to
obtain such Office Lease Release. The Seller shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, keep the Purchaser informed as promptly as practicable in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the Office Lease
Release and concurrently provide to the Purchaser copies of all documents
provided to or from the Landlord related to obtaining the Office Lease
Release. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the
Seller all cooperation reasonably requested by the Seller that is necessary in
connection with the Office Lease Release; provided that, other than with
respect to providing the Substitute Guaranty, none of the Purchaser or any its
Affiliates shall be required to pay money to the Landlord or any other third
party, commence any Legal Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to the Landlord or any other third party in
connection with the Seller's efforts to obtain the Office Lease Release. Each
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give the other Parties
advance notice of any in-person meeting or conference with the Landlord
relating to the Office Lease Release or the transactions contemplated hereby
and shall permit Representatives of the other Parties to be present at those
meetings or conferences. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall be
solely responsible for seeking to obtain the Office Lease Release, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates against any
and all Damages suffered by the Seller or any of its Affiliates arising from
or related to post-Closing actions or occupancy under such Office Lease
(unless such Damage relates to a matter for which the Purchaser is entitled to
be indemnified under this Agreement).

6.14 Specified Litigation. 

(a)From and after the Closing, (x) each Party shall notify the other Party
promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following the
receipt by such Party or any of its Affiliates of any notice, communication,
correspondence or documentation from any third party (including a Governmental
Authority) in relation to the matter described in Schedule 6.14(A) (the
"Primary Specified Litigation"), and (y) the Seller shall notify the Purchaser
promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following the
receipt by the Seller or any of its Affiliates of any notice, communication,
correspondence or documentation from any third party (including a Governmental
Authority) in relation to the matters described in Schedule 6.14(B) (the
"Additional Specified Litigations" and, collectively with the Primary
Specified Litigation, the "Specified Litigations"). Unless otherwise agreed in
writing by the Parties, and subject to this Section 6.14, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall be responsible for and have control over the
defense, settlement or any other action in connection with the Specified
Litigations; provided, however, that the Purchaser's responsibility and
control over any defense or settlement of any claims relating to the Specified
Litigations shall in no way derogate its rights to indemnification for the
Primary Specified Litigation as specifically provided for under this Section
6.14. In connection with the Specified Litigations, from and after the Closing
(i) (A) each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly provide the other Party with copies of all correspondence with or
from third parties (including any Governmental Authority) relating to the
Primary Specified Litigation and, as reasonably requested, with reasonable
access during normal business hours to all files or other documents in its or
any of its Affiliates' possession relating to the Primary Specified Litigation
(in each case, to the extent not previously provided to the other Party and to
the extent such access would not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations), and (B) the
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide the
Purchaser with copies of all correspondence with or from third parties
(including any Governmental Authority) relating to the Additional Specified
Litigations and, as reasonably requested, with reasonable access during normal
business hours to all files or other documents in its or any of its
Affiliates' possession relating to such Additional Specified Litigation (in
each case, to the extent not previously provided to the other Party, to the
extent such access would not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its
business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations and to the extent such
correspondence, files or other documents are not in the possession of the
Company); (ii) (A) each Party shall, to the extent consistent with applicable
Law, notify the other Party promptly following such Party's or any of its
Affiliates' receipt of any and all subpoenas, Orders and material requests and
communications of any third party (including any Governmental Authority)
relating to the Primary Specified Litigation, and (B) Seller shall, to the
extent consistent with applicable Law, notify the Purchaser promptly following
the Seller's or any of its Affiliates' receipt of any and all subpoenas,
Orders and material requests and communications of any third party (including
any Governmental Authority) relating to any Additional Specified Litigation;
(iii) the Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate
with the Purchaser and any of its Representatives (including its outside legal
counsel) in the defense of the Specified Litigations, including using
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the Purchaser engaging the same counsel
engaged by the Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing with respect
thereto, including by providing all waivers and consents required for
Purchaser to engage such counsel; (iv) subject to execution of a joint defense
agreement between the Seller and the Purchaser in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to them, (A) solely with respect to the Primary
Specified Litigation, the Seller shall be entitled to attend and participate
on any substantive calls with outside counsel to the extent practicable,
provide input to the Purchaser, directly or through its own legal counsel, on
strategic decisions relating to the Primary Specified Litigation (including
whether to appeal any adverse rulings), which the Purchaser will consider in
good faith; provided that, the Purchaser shall make all final decisions
relating to the Primary Specified Litigation in its sole discretion; and (B)
the Purchaser shall keep the Seller reasonably informed of the status of the
Primary Specified Litigation and shall notify the Seller promptly (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days) following any material developments in
relation thereto; (v) the Purchaser shall be entitled to change legal counsel
for any of the Specified Litigations; provided, that, with respect to the
Primary Specified Litigation, the Purchaser agrees to retain the outside 

legal counsel engaged by the Seller for such matter (the "Incumbent Counsel")
as of the date of this Agreement through the completion of the currently
pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit;
provided further that the Purchaser may, at its sole cost and expense, retain
outside legal counsel of its choosing to consult with the Incumbent Counsel
with respect to such appeal and the Seller shall direct the Incumbent Counsel
to consult in good faith with the Purchaser's counsel; (vi) with respect to
the Additional Specified Litigations, and from and after the completion of the
substitution contemplated by Section 6.14(b) with respect to the Primary
Specified Litigation, the Purchaser's counsel shall be the sole counsel of
record for such Specified Litigations; and (vii) subject to Section 6.14(f),
each of the Seller and its Affiliates and the Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall bear its own fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Specified Litigations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser and the Seller each agree that the legal counsel of
the other Party may maintain a copy of all information, materials and
documents that may be required to respond to any requests from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Specified Litigations. The rights and
obligations of the Parties under this Section 6.14(a) shall be in addition to
and not limited by Section 6.8 or Section 6.9.

(b)From and after the date of this Agreement through the Closing, the Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to substitute the Company for the Seller as
the defendant in the Primary Specified Litigation and the Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate with the Seller in connection therewith. From and after
the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to substitute the Company for the Seller as the
defendant in the Primary Specified Litigation and shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in connection therewith. In the event that substitution is not
permitted in the Primary Specified Litigation, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 6.14, the Purchaser shall nonetheless be
responsible for and have control over the defense, settlement or any other
action in connection with the Primary Specified Litigation and Seller will
take reasonable steps to ensure Purchaser shall be able to exercise such
control.

(c)Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller may settle any Additional Specified
Litigations, which settlement shall require the Purchaser's prior written
consent; provided that the Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
Purchaser for the amount of any monetary settlement and reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid by the Seller in the
negotiation and documentation of such settlement). The Purchaser shall be
responsible for any and all costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and
legal costs), damages or settlements with respect to the Additional Specified
Litigations, in each case, incurred following the Closing. The Seller shall
not settle the Primary Specified Litigation without the Purchaser's prior
written consent. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not settle
the Primary Specified Litigation without the Seller's prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d)In the event of an adverse ruling in the Primary Specified Litigation,
whether rendered prior to or after the date of this Agreement or prior to or
after the Closing, the Seller shall pay any bond required in connection with
any appeal of such adverse ruling. Nothing in this Section 6.14(d) shall limit
the Purchaser's rights set forth in Section 6.14(a) (including the Purchaser's
right to be responsible for and have control over the defense, settlement or
any other action relating to the Primary Specified Litigation).

(e)As of the Closing Date, all written communications with counsel, including
written communications (prior to or following the Closing) between counsel for
the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Specified
Litigations (collectively, the "Specified Communications") shall be shared
with the Purchaser pursuant to the Common Interest Agreement by and among the
Purchaser, the Company and the Seller, dated as of September 29, 2017. As of
the Closing Date, as to all Specified Communications, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence may be asserted by the
Seller, the Purchaser and their respective 

Affiliates, and the Seller, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates may
use or rely on any of the Specified Communications in any action relating to
the Specified Litigations; provided, however, that neither the Seller nor any
of its Affiliates may waive, or seek to obtain a waiver of, the attorney-
client privilege with respect to such Specified Communications.

(f)From and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against, and compensate and
reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, any and all losses, damages,
costs, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, interest, obligations, payments,
settlements, expenses and Liabilities, including actual damages, punitive
damages, consequential damages, special damages and diminution in value of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or the Business in
connection with the Primary Specified Litigation, together with all reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys' and other legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses), incurred or
suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising from the Primary
Specified Litigation; provided that for purposes of computing such damages
there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments, reimbursements, and
Tax benefits actually received by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates in connection with such damages or the circumstances giving
rise thereto; provided, however, that any such deduction shall be net of any
reasonable, out of pocket costs or expenses incurred in obtaining such
recovery.

(g)With respect to the Primary Specified Litigation, the terms and provisions
of this Section 6.14 shall supersede the indemnification procedures set forth
in Section 9.4. With respect to the Additional Specified Litigations, the
indemnification procedures set forth in Section 9.4 shall apply unless
otherwise set forth in this Section 6.14. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Additional Specified Litigations, to the extent disclosed on Schedule 3.11,
are not subject to indemnification by Seller under Article IX or otherwise.

(h)The Seller shall be entitled to receive any attorneys' fees awarded by the
court of the Eastern District of Texas, and actually collected by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, in the event such trial court grants the
pending motion for attorneys' fees in the matter listed in item 1 of Schedule
6.14(B) and the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller any such attorneys' fees
promptly following receipt thereof; provided that (i) the Purchaser shall be
entitled to retain any reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs or
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) incurred by it
in connection with pursuing or collecting such award for attorneys' fees; (ii)
the Purchaser shall upon the Seller's request use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect such award of attorneys' fees (provided that the Purchaser
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Seller for any reasonable and
documented, out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees) incurred by it in connection with pursuing or
collecting such award for attorneys' fees); and (iii) the Purchaser shall not
settle this matter collectively with another matter in a way that interferes
with or jeopardizes the collection of such attorneys' fees without the
Seller's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except based on the Seller receiving reasonable and
appropriate value in consideration for such attorneys' fees).

6.15 Notifications. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller shall promptly
notify the Purchaser in writing of the Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries obtaining Knowledge of: (i) any event, condition, fact
or circumstance that would cause or constitute a breach of or an inaccuracy in
any material respect in any representation or warranty made by the Seller or
the Company in this Agreement if such representation or warranty had been made
as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event,
condition, fact or circumstance, such that the condition in Section 8.1(a)(i)
would not be satisfied; (ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the
Seller or the Company such that the condition in Section 8.1(a)(ii) would not
be satisfied; and (iii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would
make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article VII
impossible or unlikely. No notification 

under this Section 6.15 shall be required with respect to matters consented to
in writing by the Purchaser pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 6.3 or
the actual taking of actions contemplated by Schedule 6.3.

6.16 Credit Agreement. The Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and each of its and their respective Representatives to, obtain and
deliver to the Purchaser substantially simultaneously with the Closing all
documents and instruments necessary or appropriate to effect and evidence (i)
the termination on the Closing Date of all security interests and Liens
created or granted under the Collateral Documents (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) in assets and property of, and equity interests in, the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (ii) the release on the Closing Date of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries from all guaranty obligations under the Guaranty (as
defined in the Credit Agreement), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser (such documentation, the "Credit Release
Documentation").

6.17 Additional Required Financial Information. To the extent the Closing Date
occurs sixty (60) or more days after December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018, as
applicable, the Company shall deliver the applicable Additional Required
Financial Information to the Purchaser within five (5) Business Days after
such Additional Required Financial Information becomes available.

6.18 Foreign Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (or shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to) distribute or otherwise divest all of
the equity interests of Big Fish Games Luxembourg SARL, and liquidate or
dissolve, or distribute or otherwise divest all of its equity interest in Big
Fish Games Ireland Limited to the Seller or one or more of the Seller's
Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or, in the
Company's discretion, to a third party (such transactions, the "Restructuring
Transaction"). All documentation relating to the Restructuring Transaction
executed after the date hereof shall be subject to the Purchaser's prior
review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

6.19 Transitional Services. Promptly following the date hereof, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith, and at Closing shall, or shall cause their
applicable Affiliates to, enter into, a mutually acceptable transition
services agreement pursuant to which, from and after the Closing, the Seller
or its Affiliates shall provide to the Company or its Affiliates certain
treasury, financial reporting, accounts payable and other services agreed upon
by the Parties. Such services shall be provided without charge, except that
the Company or its relevant Affiliate shall reimburse the Seller and its
Affiliates for their actual costs and expenses incurred in providing such
services, including the allocable portion of any overhead or related expenses,
but in any case excluding any markup. For the avoidance of doubt, the entry
into a transition services agreement after the date hereof shall not be a
condition to Closing under this Agreement.

VII. TAX MATTERS

The following provisions of this Article VII shall govern the allocation
between the Purchaser and the Seller of responsibility for certain Tax matters
involving the Company following the Closing Date. In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Article VII and any other provision of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Article VII shall control.

7.1 Preparation of Tax Returns; Control of Audits; Tax Refunds.

(a)The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared for filing by the Company
all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Periods") that are
due after the Closing Date other than Tax Returns filed on an affiliated,
combined, consolidated or unitary basis with the Seller or any Affiliate of
the Seller other than solely the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Pre-Closing Tax Returns"). Such Pre-Closing Tax Returns 

shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's or the relevant
Subsidiary's past practices, except to the extent required by applicable Law.
Such income, franchise, value added, goods and services and similar Tax
Returns (including any related work papers or other information reasonably
requested by the Purchaser) shall be provided to the Purchaser for its review
not later than forty-five (45) Business Days before the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (including extensions) (or, in the case of Pre-Closing Tax
Returns due within forty-five (45) Business Days after the Closing Date, as
promptly as practicable after the Closing Date), and the Seller shall notify
the Purchaser with respect to any such Tax Return not prepared in a manner
consistent with applicable past practice. If the Purchaser does not provide
the Seller with a written description of the items in the Pre-Closing Tax
Returns that the Purchaser intends to dispute within fifteen (15) Business
Days following the delivery to the Purchaser of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns,
the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to such documents in
the form provided, and the Purchaser shall thereafter cause all such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns to be timely filed by the Company. The Purchaser shall not
make any changes to such Pre-Closing Tax Returns without the prior written
approval of the Seller. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to timely consult
with each other and to negotiate in good faith any timely-raised issue arising
as a result of the review of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns to permit the filing
of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns, as promptly as possible, which good faith
negotiations shall include each side exchanging in writing their positions
concerning the matter(s) in dispute and a meeting to discuss their respective
positions. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute within
ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of written notice by the
Purchaser of such dispute, the Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly request
the Accounting Firm to resolve any issue in dispute at least five (5) Business
Days before the due date of such Pre-Closing Tax Return, in order that such
Pre-Closing Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting Firm shall make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue within five (5) Business Days
before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the Pre-Closing
Tax Return in question, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to file such Pre-Closing Tax Return on the due date (including
extensions) therefor in a manner consistent with the determination of the
Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be binding on
the Parties; provided, however, that any such determination shall be limited
to the resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser. Except
as expressly contemplated in this Article VII, under no circumstances shall
the Purchaser or the Company amend any Pre-Closing Tax Returns for Pre-Closing
Periods without the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Seller covenants
and agrees to pay when due any Taxes reflected as due and owing on any Pre-
Closing Tax Return prepared and filed pursuant to this Section 7.1(a), other
than to the extent that any such Tax is taken into account for purposes of
determining Closing Working Capital. No election shall be made under Section
338 of the Code or similar provision of state, local or foreign Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date shall be determined based on a closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time) except that the amount of other Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries imposed on a time basis for a Straddle
Period that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare or cause to be prepared, and file
or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Straddle Periods. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past
practices, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Such Tax Returns
(including any related work papers or other information reasonably requested
by the Seller) 

with respect to a Straddle Period ("Straddle Period Tax Returns") shall be
provided to the Seller for its review not later than forty-five (45) Business
Days before the due date for filing such Straddle Period Tax Returns
(including extensions) (or, in the case of Straddle Period Tax Returns due
within forty-five (45) Business Days after the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date), and the Purchaser shall notify the Seller
with respect to any such Straddle Period Tax Return not prepared in a manner
consistent with applicable past practice. If the Seller does not provide the
Purchaser with a written description of the items in the Straddle Period Tax
Returns that the Seller intends to dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days
following the delivery to the Seller of such Straddle Period Tax Returns, the
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to such Straddle Period Tax
Returns in the form provided, and the Purchaser shall thereafter cause such
Straddle Period Tax Returns to be timely filed by the Company in the form
provided to the Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to timely consult
with each other and to negotiate in good faith any timely-raised issue arising
as a result of the review of such Straddle Period Tax Returns to permit the
filing of such Straddle Period Tax Returns as promptly as possible, which good
faith negotiations shall include each side exchanging in writing their
positions concerning the matter or matters in dispute and a meeting to discuss
their respective positions. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute within ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of written notice
by the Seller of such dispute, the Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly
request the Accounting Firm to resolve any issue in dispute at least five (5)
Business Days before the due date of such Straddle Period Tax Returns, in
order that such Straddle Period Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting
Firm shall make a determination with respect to any disputed issue within five
(5) Business Days before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of
the Straddle Period Tax Return in question, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to file such Straddle Period Tax Return on the due date (including
extensions) therefor in a manner consistent with the determination of the
Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be binding on
the Parties; provided, however, that any such determination shall be limited
to the resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser. In
addition to the Straddle Period Tax Returns prepared by the Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 7.1(b), the Purchaser shall also submit to the Seller,
together with Straddle Period Tax Returns, a proposed allocation of the Tax
liability shown on such Straddle Period Tax Return that relates to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, determined in
accordance with this Section 7.1(b) ("Seller's Straddle Period Allocation"),
and the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in this Section 7.1(b) shall
also apply with respect to such proposed Seller's Straddle Period Allocation.
The Seller covenants and agrees to pay when due the Seller's Straddle Period
Allocation (as finally determined, if applicable, between the Parties or by
the Accounting Firm in the manner described above) of Taxes shown as due and
owing on any Straddle Period Tax Return no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the due date for payment of such Taxes, except for any amount of such
Tax that has been taken into account for purposes of determining Closing
Working Capital.

(c)The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in connection with the filing
of the Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.1 and, subject in all respects
to the provisions of Section 7.2, in connection with any Legal Proceeding with
respect to the Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation shall include reasonably furnishing or making available during
normal business hours of personnel, powers of attorney, and the retention and
(upon a Party's request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to the preparation of any such Tax Return or to any such
Legal Proceeding. The Purchaser and the Seller shall (i) retain or cause to be
retained all books and records that are in their possession with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
Purchaser or the Seller, any extension thereof) of the applicable taxable
periods, and abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority, and (ii) give the other Parties reasonable written
notice before transferring, destroying or discarding any such 

books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the Purchaser or the
Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of
such books and records.

(d)The Purchaser and the Seller shall, upon request, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including with respect to
the transaction contemplated hereby).

(e)To the extent that, subsequent to the Closing Date, the Purchaser, the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates (i) actually receives any
cash Tax refund attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) actually uses any credits against Taxes
in lieu of refunds described in clause (i), such Tax refund or credits shall
be the property of the Seller net of any cost or expense incurred by the
Purchaser, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates in
connection with procuring or receiving such refund or credit, other than to
the extent set forth in the following sentence, and the Purchaser shall remit,
and shall cause the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable,
to remit such Tax refund(s) or credits to the Seller, within three (3)
Business Days after the actual receipt by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of such Tax refunds or after the actual reduction of a cash Tax
payment on account of such Tax credits. The foregoing shall not apply with
respect to any Tax refund that is reflected as an asset of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining Closing Working Capital.

(f)Without the prior written consent of the Seller, neither the Purchaser nor
the Company nor any Affiliates thereof shall make or change any election,
change any annual accounting period, file any amended Tax Return, enter into
any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, or take any other similar action, or omit to take any action, in each
case relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, if such action or omission would
have the effect of increasing the liability or obligation of the Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes related to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, unless such election, change in annual
accounting period, or filing of an amended Tax Return is required under
applicable Law.

(g)The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by
the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any pending or threatened federal,
state, local or foreign Tax audits, assessments, or administrative or court
Legal Proceeding relating to Taxes for which the Seller, any of its Affiliates
or, with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or any Straddle Period, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable. The Seller shall have the
right to represent the Company's and each Subsidiary's interests in any such
Tax audit, assessment or administrative or court Legal Proceeding relating any
such Taxes and to employ counsel of the Seller's choice at the Seller's
expense; provided, however, that (i) the Purchaser and its Representatives
shall be permitted, at the Purchaser's expense, to be present at, and
participate in, any such Legal Proceeding, (ii) the Seller shall not be
permitted to take a position in such Legal Proceeding reasonably expected to
adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the Company for any Tax period
ending after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (iii) the Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
represent the Company's and each Subsidiary's interest in any such Legal
Proceeding if the Seller declines to represent such entity's interests, and
(iv) the Seller shall not be permitted to represent the Company's or any
Subsidiary's interest in any such Legal Proceeding unless the Seller first
acknowledges in writing to the Purchaser that the Seller will assume
responsibility for any liability arising from the resolution of any such Legal
Proceeding. Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect such liability
for such Taxes without the prior 

written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Neither the Seller nor any Affiliate of the
Seller shall be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which would adversely affect
such liability for such Taxes of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(h)Section 7.1(g) shall apply with respect to any audit, assessment, or
administrative or court Legal Proceeding relating to any payments (or the
failure to make any payments) under escheatment and unclaimed property Law as
if such payments were Taxes.

7.2 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added, and other such similar Taxes (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be borne equally between the
Purchaser and the Seller and paid by such Parties when due, and the Purchaser
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes.

7.3 Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties of Section 3.6 and the covenants and agreements
in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force
and effect until the later of (a) ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
applicable statutes of limitation for the Taxes in question (taking into
account any extensions or waivers thereof and including any extensions of
statutory periods relating to the collection of Taxes), and (b) in the case of
any claim made with reasonable specificity by the Party seeking to be
indemnified and within the time period set forth in clause (a), until such
claim is finally and fully resolved.

IX. SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival. Notwithstanding any right of any Party to fully investigate the
affairs of the other Parties and not withstanding any knowledge of facts
determined or determinable by such Party pursuant to such investigation or
right of investigation, each Party has the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of each other Party
contained in this Agreement. The indemnification 

obligations of the Parties with respect to (a) inaccuracies in or breaches of
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall terminate and
expire, and shall cease to be of any force or effect, on the date that is the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, and all liability with
respect to such indemnification obligations shall thereupon be extinguished
(except (x) to the extent a claim for indemnification has been validly made
prior to such time for any breach thereof, which shall terminate and expire
immediately after the claim is finally and fully resolved, (y) for
indemnification obligations with respect to Purchaser Fundamental
Representations, Company Fundamental Representations (other than the
representations and warranties in Section 3.6 (Tax Matters)) and Seller
Fundamental Representations, which shall terminate and expire, and shall cease
to be of any force or effect, on the date that is the later of the third
anniversary of the Closing Date and the date that is ninety (90) days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account
extensions or waivers and including the maximum periods for extension under
applicable Law), and (z) for indemnification obligations with respect to the
representations and warranties in Section 3.6 (Tax Matters) and the covenants
and agreements in Article VII, which shall terminate and expire, and shall
cease to be of any force or effect, as set forth in Section 7.3) and (b)
breaches of covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall
terminate and expire, and shall cease to be of any force or effect, on the
date that is (i) in the case of covenants and agreements to be performed prior
to the Closing, the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) for
all other covenants and agreements, on the date on which such covenants and
agreements expire in accordance with their terms or, if no such term is
specified, until the full performance thereof (except, in each case (i) and
(ii), to the extent a claim for indemnification has been validly made prior to
such time for any breach thereof, which shall terminate and expire immediately
after the claim is finally and fully resolved). It is the express intent of
the Parties that, if the applicable survival period for a representation or
warranty or covenant or agreement as contemplated by this Section 9.1 is
shorter than the statute of limitations period (taking into account extensions
or waivers and including the maximum periods for extension under applicable
Law) that would otherwise have been applicable to such representation or
warranty or covenant or agreement, then by virtue of this Agreement, the
applicable statute of limitations period (taking into account extensions or
waivers and including the maximum periods for extension under applicable Law)
with respect to such representation or warranty or covenant or agreement shall
be reduced to the shortened survival period expressly stated in this Section
9.1, as applicable thereto. The Parties further acknowledge that the time
periods set forth in this Section 9.1 for the assertion of claims for breaches
of representations and warranties or covenants or agreements under this
Agreement are the result of arms'-length negotiation among the Parties and
that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed among the
Parties.

9.2 Indemnification by the Seller.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article IX, from and after (and
contingent on) the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates, Representatives, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against, and shall
compensate and reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, any and all
Damages actually incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to
the extent arising out of or resulting from: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the Seller in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (in each
case, without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty,
other than with respect to Sections 3.5(a) and 3.7(b) and the term "Material
Contracts" as used in Section 3.9 and elsewhere in this Agreement); (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement required to be performed by the Company
prior to the Closing, the Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) any
Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries incurred prior to the Closing
and outstanding as of the Closing and any Selling Expenses, in each case, that
are not taken into account in the Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.5; and (iv) 

the Restructuring Transaction (including all Restructuring Taxes), Big Fish
Games Luxembourg SARL or Big Fish Games Ireland Limited.

(b)The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to Section 9.2(a) unless on or before the applicable date
specified in Section 9.1, the Purchaser notifies the Seller in writing of a
claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the
extent then known by the Purchaser.

(c)The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) until the total amount of such Damages
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2(a)(i), in the
aggregate, exceeds $9,900,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(i) in excess of the Deductible, subject to the other
limitations in this Article IX. Furthermore, no Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to any individual claim
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for Damages if the entire amount of Damages
related to such claim is less than $50,000 (the "Per-Claim Threshold");
provided that in the case of any group of claims arising out of the same or
substantially similar facts, events or circumstances, such claims shall be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Per-Claim Threshold has
been exceeded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in this Section
9.2(c) shall not apply to claims of actual fraud or any inaccuracy in or
breach of the Company Fundamental Representations or the Seller Fundamental
Representations.

(d)The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than for claims of actual fraud
or any inaccuracy in or breach of any Company Fundamental Representation or
Seller Fundamental Representation) in excess of $99,000,000.

(e)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except with respects to claim of actual fraud or for claims brought pursuant
to Section 6.14 with respect to the Primary Specified Litigation, the Seller's
maximum aggregate indemnification liability pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall
not exceed the Purchase Price.

9.3 Indemnification by the Purchaser.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article IX, from and after (and
contingent on) the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Seller and its Affiliates, Representatives, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and shall
compensate and reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any and all
Damages actually incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the
extent arising out of or resulting from: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (in each case, without giving
effect to any materiality, Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty); and (ii)
any breach of any covenant or agreement required to be performed by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

(b)The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any amounts
pursuant to Section 9.3(a) unless on or before the applicable date specified
in Section 9.1, the Seller notifies the Purchaser in writing of a claim
specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent
then known by the Seller.

(c)The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any amounts
pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) until the total amount of such Damages incurred
by the Seller Indemnified Parties under Section 9.3(a)(i), in the aggregate,
exceeds the Deductible, in which case the Seller Indemnified Parties will 

be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) in excess of
the Deductible, subject to the other limitations in this Article IX.
Furthermore, no Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
with respect to any individual claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) for Damages
if the entire amount of Damages related to such claim is less than the Per-
Claim Threshold; provided that in the case of any group of claims arising out
of the same or substantially similar facts, events or circumstances, such
claims shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Per-Claim
Threshold has been exceeded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in
this Section 9.3(c) shall not apply to claims of actual fraud or any
inaccuracy in or breach of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations.

(d)The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any amounts
pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) (other than for claims of actual fraud or any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation) in excess
of $99,000,000.

(e)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except with respects to claim of actual fraud, the Purchaser's maximum
aggregate indemnification liability pursuant to Section 9.3(a) shall not
exceed the Purchase Price.

9.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a)Except as provided in Article VII with respect to certain Tax matters, if
any Person entitled to seek indemnification under Section 9.2 or 9.3 (an
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion, continuation or
commencement of any Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party and
wishes to seek indemnification from any other Party (an "Indemnifying Party")
pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give such Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof; provided, however, that if the
Indemnified Party receives a complaint, petition, or any other pleading in
connection with a Third Party Claim which requires the filing of an answer or
other responsive pleading, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the
Indemnifying Party with a copy of such pleading at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date a responsive pleading thereto is required to be filed (or
promptly upon receipt by the Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party
receives such complaint, petition or other pleading within such thirty (30)
day period). Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Third
Party Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available written
evidence thereof, and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense,
or at its option (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.4(a))
to assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that:

(i)the Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party written notice of
its election to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim within
ten (10) days of the Indemnifying Party's receipt of notice of the Third Party
Claim;

(ii)the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to (x) participate in the defense
of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the fees and expenses of
such defense shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay any reasonable fees and expenses of separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party effectively
assumes control of such defense; and (y) shall have the right to receive, and
the Indemnifying Party shall promptly provide to the Indemnified Party, copies
of all pleadings and other material documents related to such Third Party
Claim; provided, that following the Indemnifying Party's assumption of the
defense of such Third Party Claim, if the Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes, based upon advice of counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have a material conflict or that there are legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Legal 

Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall pay for the reasonable fees and costs
of outside legal counsel for the Indemnified Party in connection with such
defense, which such reasonable fees and costs shall be deemed Damages that are
entitled to indemnification hereunder;

(iii)the Indemnifying Party shall not be so entitled to assume and control
such defense if (t) an actual conflict of interest (as determined by the
Indemnified Party after obtaining advice of counsel) exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party
Claim that precludes effective joint representation, (u) the Third Party Claim
seeks remedies other than or in addition to money damages, (v) the
Indemnifying Party shall not have irrevocably and unconditionally agreed, on a
timely basis in accordance with clause (i) above, to indemnify the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations of
this Article IX), (w) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, investigation or allegation,
(x) such Third Party Claim alleges infringement, misappropriation or other
violation of the Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights of a
third party, or (y) such Third Party Claim alleges a violation of Law by, or
is brought by a Governmental Authority and is reasonably likely to result in a
regulatory enforcement action by a Governmental Authority against, the
Indemnified Party and, in the case of this clause (y), would reasonably be
expected to result in a material and adverse change in the business of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

(iv)If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to undertake any such defense
against a Third Party Claim (or is not entitled to do so pursuant to this
Section 9.4(a)), then the Indemnified Party may assume such defense, and any
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with such
defense shall be deemed Damages that are entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.2, and the Indemnifying Party may participate in such defense at
its own expense, and shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings
and other material documents related to such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
by the Indemnifying Party and make available to the Indemnifying Party all
witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume and control the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, such Third Party Claim unless the
Indemnified Party consents in writing; provided that such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as: (i) a firm offer is
made to settle a Third Party Claim that (A) does not impose injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates,
(B) does not contain a financial or other obligation on the part of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, and (C) provides, in customary
form, for the full, unconditional written release of each Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides written
notice to the Indemnified Party that it desires to accept and agree to such
offer and the terms thereof. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.4(a), it shall not consent to a
settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b)Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party becomes
aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe
the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available
material written evidence thereof, and will indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Damages that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. 

The Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30) days from which to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not
respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
at the Indemnifying Party's expense pursuant to the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

(c)A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information in
any notice as provided in Sections 9.4(a) or 9.4(b) will not affect the rights
or obligations of any Party, except the extent that, as a result of such
failure, any Party that was entitled to receive such notice was deprived of
its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance coverage or
was otherwise actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to control the defense of any Third Party Claim arising out of or
relating to the matters set forth on Schedule 6.14.

9.5 Miscellaneous Indemnification Provisions.

(a)Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, other than claims for actual
fraud, the indemnification provisions of Section 6.14 and this Article IX
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective Affiliates with respect to claims under, or otherwise relating to
the transactions that are the subject of, this Agreement, whether sounding in
contract, tort, fraud, or otherwise, and whether asserted against the Company
or its Subsidiaries, their respective officers, directors or employees, the
Seller or any other Person. For purposes of this Agreement, "actual fraud"
means a fraud involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of a fact
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (made with the
knowledge that a representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement was
actually breached when made), and made with the express intent of inducing the
other Party to enter into this Agreement and upon which such Party has relied
to its detriment (as opposed to any fraud claim based on constructive
knowledge, negligent misrepresentation or a similar theory). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any Party, its successors
or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties, on behalf of
itself and its equity owners, directors, managers, officers, employees, and
Affiliates, agrees not to bring any actions or proceedings, at Law, equity or
otherwise, against any other Party or its and its equity owners, directors,
managers, officers, employees, and Affiliates, in respect of any breach or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant and agreement in this
Agreement, except pursuant to the express provisions of Section 6.14 and this
Article IX. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, each Party shall be
entitled to bring an action for injunctive or other equitable relief to
enforce the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Section 6.14 and this Article
IX shall be deemed a waiver by any Party of any right or remedy which such
Party may have at law or in equity based on the actual fraud of any other
Party, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit: (i) the
amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any claim for actual fraud against
such other Party; (ii) the time period during which a claim for actual fraud
may be brought against such other Party; or (iii) the recourse which any such
party may seek against such other Party with respect to a claim for actual
fraud.

(b)Purchase Price Adjustment. The Parties agree that any indemnification
payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law. 

(c)Good Faith; Mutual Cooperation. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any
claim or liability with respect to which Party is obligated to indemnify the
other Party hereunder, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate or resolve any such claims or liability to the extent required under
applicable Law; provided that, any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by
the Indemnified Party in its efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claims or
liability shall be deemed Damages for which the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification under and subject to this Article IX. In the event
that an Indemnified Party fails to make such commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability to the extent required
under applicable Law, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify
the Indemnified Party for any Damages that would reasonably be expected to
have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

(d)Set-Off. In addition to any right of set-off, deduction or recoupment
provided or allowed by Law, in the event a Party is obligated to make payments
under this Agreement to the other Party, such Party may, by written notice to
the other Party, set off against, and deduct and recoup from, any amounts due
from the other Party under this Agreement.

X. MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Termination.

(a)This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

(i)by the written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

(ii)by the Purchaser, in the event of any breach by the Company or the Seller
of any covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement that
would prevent or has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of the Purchaser set forth in Section 8.1, at the Closing, and
such breach has not been waived by the Purchaser, as applicable, or, in the
case of a covenant breach, cannot be or has not been cured by the Company or
the Seller within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice
thereof from the Purchaser and (B) the Outside Date; provided that the
Purchaser is not then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which breach would give
rise to a failure of a condition to the obligations of the Seller set forth in
Section 8.2;

(iii)by the Seller, in the event of any breach by the Purchaser of any
covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement that would
prevent or has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligation
of the Seller set forth in Section 8.2 at the Closing, and such breach has not
been waived by the Seller or, in the case of a covenant breach, cannot be or
has not been cured by the Purchaser, as applicable, within the earlier of (A)
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof by the Seller and (B) the
Outside Date; provided that neither the Seller nor the Company is then in
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement which breach would give rise to a failure of a
condition to the obligations of the Purchaser set forth in Section 8.1;

(iv)by the Purchaser or the Seller, if the transactions contemplated hereby
have not been consummated by the Outside Date; provided, however, that the
Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, will not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(a)(iv) if the Purchaser's breach of
this Agreement, on the one hand, or the Company's or the Seller's breach of
this Agreement, on the other hand, has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such date; or 

(v)by either the Purchaser or the Seller, by written notice to the other
Party, if the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is otherwise enjoined or prohibited by the terms of any Law or a final, non-
appealable Order;

(b)Any Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a)
shall give written notice of such termination to the other Party or Parties,
as the case may be, to this Agreement. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall thereupon become null and void and of no
further force and effect, except for the provisions of Article I and this
Article X. Nothing in this Section 10.1 shall be deemed to release any Party
from any liability for actual fraud or breach by such Party of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement prior to termination, or impair the
right of any Party to compel specific performance by any other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

10.2 No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources. Subject to the rights of the
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter related thereto under
the terms thereof, (i) no Seller Related Party shall have any right, claim or
recourse whatsoever, whether at law or equity, in contract, tort or otherwise,
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, toward or against the Debt Financing Sources,
(ii) the Debt Financing Sources shall not have any obligations or liabilities
to the Seller Related Parties and all such obligations and liabilities, if
any, are hereby irrevocably waived, and (iii) the Debt Financing Sources shall
not be liable to any Seller Related Party for any special, consequential,
punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature. For the
avoidance of doubt, (a) nothing in this Section 10.2 is intended to limit or
modify any obligations or liabilities the Debt Financing Sources may have
toward the Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective shareholders,
partners, members, controlling persons or Representatives under the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter related thereto and (b) the Debt
Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates and their respective
shareholders, partners, members, controlling persons and Representatives shall
not have any right, claim or recourse whatsoever, whether at law or equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise, in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, toward or
against any Party hereto or any related Person thereof.

except that (a) the Purchaser may assign any of its rights (but not its

and the Company hereby agree and consent to any such assignment); provided
that (i) no such assignee shall have greater rights than the Purchaser and its

in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), will be governed by, and enforced and construed in accordance

faith advice of its counsel, determines that any such court may not exercise
or have jurisdiction over the other Party or such matter or that a judgment
rendered by such court may not be enforceable in the jurisdiction of the
organization of the other Party or a jurisdiction in which such other Party's
office(s) or assets are located. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
accepts and submits, for itself and in respect of its properties, to the

specified in Section 10.3 for notices to such Party. 

In addition to or in lieu of any such service, service of process may also be
made in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection or defense which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue to any such action, suit
or proceeding in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (or if jurisdiction is not available in such court, then in any
federal court located in the State of New York) and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

performance thereof by the Debt Financing Sources shall be governed by the
Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws
rules or principles thereof to the extent such rules or principles would

state or federal court sitting in New York County, New York in any action,

hereto under this Agreement and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Seller, the Company nor the Purchaser would have
entered into this Agreement. Each Party to this Agreement hereby agrees to
waive the defense in any such suit that the other Parties to this Agreement
have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal or
otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a
remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in
connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in
this Section 10.11 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies at law or in equity that the Parties to this Agreement may elect to
pursue.

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
shall constitute the same agreement, and the execution of a counterpart of the
signature page to this Agreement shall be deemed the execution of a
counterpart of this Agreement. The delivery of this Agreement may be made by
facsimile or email transmission of a portable document format (pdf), and such
signatures shall be treated as original signatures for all purposes.

10.13 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and will not control or affect the meaning or construction of
any provisions of this Agreement.

10.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto)
constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement, and is a complete and final integration thereof.
This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, which the Parties disclaim
reliance on.

10.15 Confidentiality.

(a)The terms of the confidentiality agreement dated July 17, 2017, as amended
from time to time (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between Aristocrat
Technologies Australia Pty Limited and the Seller are incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect (and all
obligations thereunder shall be binding upon the Purchaser and its
Representatives as if parties thereto) until the Closing, at which time the
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided,
however, that the Purchaser's confidentiality obligations shall terminate only
in respect of that portion of the Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, their respective assets or
properties, or the Business, and for all other Confidential Information the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. If, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

(b)Each Party agrees that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials
and other information which it shall have obtained regarding the other Parties
hereto during the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the 

date of this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the
preparation of this Agreement and other related documents, and, in the event
the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be consummated, each Party will
return to the other Parties or destroy all copies of nonpublic documents and
materials which have been furnished in connection therewith. Such documents,
materials and information shall not be communicated to any third party (other
than to its counsel, accountants or Affiliates). No Party shall use or
disclose any confidential or proprietary information of any other Party or any
other Party's Affiliates in any manner whatsoever except solely for the
purpose of evaluating the proposed transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that after the Closing, (x) the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates may use or disclose any confidential information related to
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company, its Subsidiaries, their
respective assets, operations or business (including the Business) or the
Products and (y) the Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, (i) keep confidential all non-public or proprietary
information existing prior to or as of the Closing Date to the extent relating
to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective assets, operations or
business (including the Business), and (ii) only use such information to the
extent required to comply with their obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
The Parties acknowledge the practical difficulty of policing the use of
information in the unaided memory of the individuals at the Seller and its
Subsidiaries, and as such each Party agrees that the Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from using, for any purpose permitted
under this Agreement, without restriction or obligation any information in a
nontangible form that is unintentionally retained in the unaided memory (i.e.,
without conscious memorization or subsequent reference to any material which
is written or stored in electronic or physical form) of the individuals at the
Seller and its Subsidiaries who have had access to such information prior to
the Closing, including concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. The
obligation of each Party to treat such documents, materials and other
information in confidence shall not apply to any information which (i) is or
becomes available to such Party from a source other than the other Party or
its Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) is or becomes available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by such Party or its Affiliates or
Representatives, (iii) is required to be disclosed under applicable Law
(regulatory reporting requirements) or judicial process but only to the extent
it must be disclosed, (iv) subject to the Seller's obligations under clause
(y) of the previous sentence, was in a Party's possession or available to such
Party before receipt from any other Party or from any party with a
confidentiality agreement with any such other Party, (v) is independently
conceived and developed by such Party or its Affiliates or Representatives
without violating the terms of this Agreement or (vi) is related to the
assertion of such Party's rights under or in connection with this Agreement,
but only in the case of clauses (i) through (vi) to the extent it must be
disclosed, and only in the cases of clauses (iii) and (vi), if such Party
provides prior notice of any such disclosure to the Party whose information is
subject to disclosure so that the other Party may seek an appropriate
protective order and discloses only those portions of such information legally
required to be disclosed. No Party shall have any obligation hereunder to keep
confidential any non-public or proprietary information of any other Party if
and to the extent disclosure of any such information is specifically required
by applicable Law, the requirements of a national securities exchange
(including NASDAQ regulations or the rules of the Australian Securities
Exchange), or court proceedings or similar legal process. In such event, and
to the extent permitted by applicable Law or legal process and prior to any
such disclosure of such information, the party under an obligation to disclose
may make such disclosure of such information in order not to commit a
violation of Law or legal process, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to notify the other Party of such requirements to afford the Party who
initially provided such information the opportunity to seek, at its sole cost
and expense, a protective order or other remedy.

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement
to the contrary, the Purchaser and its Representatives may disclose (i)
Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and
(ii) the documents, materials and other information described in Section
10.15(b) to actual and prospective Debt Financing Sources and investors in
connection with the Debt 

Financing or any alternative financing (provided that such actual and
prospective Debt Financing Sources and investors are subject to customary
confidentiality provisions).

10.16 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
and such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision will be reformed,
construed and enforced as if such provision had never been contained herein
and there had been contained in this Agreement instead such valid, legal and
enforceable provisions as would most nearly accomplish the intent and purpose
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

10.17 Legal Representation. The Purchaser and the Company hereby agree, on
their own behalf and on behalf of their directors, managers, members,
officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns
(all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that, following the Closing, Sidley
may represent the Seller or any manager, director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of the Seller in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (any such representation, the "Post-Closing
Representation") notwithstanding its pre-Closing representation (or any
continued representation) of the Company. Each of the Purchaser and the
Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents to any
Post-Closing Representation and (a) irrevocably waives (and will not assert)
any actual or potential conflict of interest or any argument that Sidley is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation, and (b) agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arising after the Closing between the
Purchaser or the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of the
Seller's Affiliates, on the other hand, Sidley may represent, solely in a
Post-Closing Representation, the Seller or any of the Seller's Affiliates in
such Post-Closing Representation even though the interests of such person(s)
may be directly adverse to the Purchaser or the Company and even though Sidley
may have represented the Company in a manner substantially related to such
dispute. The Purchaser and the Company each acknowledges that the foregoing
provision applies whether or not Sidley provides legal services to the Company
after the Closing Date. Each of the Purchaser and the Company, for itself and
the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between the Company and the Seller and their counsel, including
Sidley, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, are
privileged communications that are also subject to the expectation of client
confidence, that do not remain with the Company following the Closing, and
instead remain with and are controlled by the Seller (the "Privileged
Communications"). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to privileged
communications between the Company and Sidley that do not relate to the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the privilege will remain with the Company and is not waived under
this Section 10.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a
third party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Sidley to such third party; provided, however
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Seller. The Purchaser and the
Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns, agree that no Person may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications, whether located in the records or email server of
the Company, or otherwise, in any action against or involving any of the
Parties after the Closing, and the Purchaser and the Company agree not to
assert that the privilege has been waived as to the Privileged Communication
that may be located in the records or email server of the Company. 

10.18 Press Release and Announcements. The initial press release by Seller
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller nor the
Company (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall, without the approval
of each other Parties (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any other press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as required by Law (including applicable securities Laws) or stock
exchange rules, in which case such Party shall, to the extent practicable,
consult the other Parties (whether or not such other Party is named in such
release or announcement) a reasonable time prior to its release or
announcement to allow the other Parties to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance and, after such release or
announcement, shall provide the other Parties with a copy thereof (or summary
thereof in the case of oral announcement); provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to
implement the provisions of this Agreement.

10.19 Exclusivity of Agreement. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define
their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the subject matter of
this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are
owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Furthermore, the Parties hereby acknowledge that this
Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties
derived from arm's length negotiations, and all Parties to this Agreement
specifically acknowledge that no Party has any special relationship with
another Person that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's length transaction. From and after
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms of
this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein)
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies may be further limited or excluded pursuant
to the express terms of this Agreement), and the Parties hereto hereby waive
and release any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based
upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any tort claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in this Section
10.19 shall not apply to claims of actual fraud.

10.20 Interpretation. The Article and Section headings in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect
the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. References
to Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits in this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated, are references to Articles, Sections, Schedules and
Exhibits of or to this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to any term or
provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party to this Agreement by virtue of the
authorship of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. A reference to
(a) any Law or to any provision of any Law shall include any modification,
amendment, re-enactment thereof, any legislative provision substituted

modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof

in the appropriate Schedule and (c) to the word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if." Any reference to a Governmental
Authority shall be deemed also to refer to any successor thereto unless the
context requires otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i)
the word "including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words
"without limitation," (ii) words (including defined terms) in the singular
shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, (iii) words of one
gender shall be 

deemed to include the other gender as the context requires, (iv) the terms

Agreement) and not to any particular term or provision of this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified, (v) the use of the word "or" shall not be
exclusive, (vi) unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, accounting terms
shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied, (vii) any references to "dollars" or "$" shall be
references to U.S. dollars and (viii) any references to "made available", as
used in Article III, Article IV or Section 6.3 means, with respect to any
document, that such document was (x) contained in the Data Room and which Data
Room has been accessible to the Purchaser and its legal counsel or (y) was
delivered by email to the Purchaser or its Representatives by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives at least 48 hours prior to the date
of this Agreement.

10.21 Schedules. (a) The information contained in the Schedules is disclosed
solely for the purposes of this Agreement and may include items or information
not required to be disclosed under this Agreement, and no information
contained in any Schedule shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third Person of any matter whatsoever, including an admission of
any violation of any Laws or breach of any agreement, (b) information
contained in a Section, subsection or individual Schedule (or expressly
incorporated therein) shall qualify the representations and warranties made in

Agreement and all other representations and warranties made in any other
Section, subsection or Schedule to the extent its applicability to such
Section, subsection or Schedule is reasonably apparent, (c) references to
agreements in the Schedules are not intended to be a full description of such

entirety, and (d) nothing disclosed in any Schedule is intended to broaden any
representation or warranty contained in Articles III or IV.
