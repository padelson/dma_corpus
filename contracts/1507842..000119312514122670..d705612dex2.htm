its business as currently conducted (the " _Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits

expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.2 _Authority_. The Buyer has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation
by the Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Buyer and, assuming due execution and
delivery by each of the other parties hereto and thereto, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Buyer, enforceable
against the Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

Section 4.3  _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Buyer of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will
not:

(i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Buyer;

(ii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Buyer or by which any
property, right or asset of the Buyer is bound or affected; or

(iii) conflict with, result in any breach or violation of, constitute a
default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become
a default) or result

 



27  in the loss of a benefit under, or require any consent of any Person
pursuant to, or give to others any rights of termination, acceleration,
amendment or cancellation of, any material Contract to which the Buyer is a
party;

except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, loss of benefits or other occurrences that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Buyer is not required to file or notify, seek or obtain any notice,
authorization, registration, declaration, approval, order, permit or consent
of or with any Governmental Authority in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by the Buyer of this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or in order to prevent the termination
of any right, privilege, license or qualification of the Buyer, except (i) for
such filings as may be required by any applicable federal or state
securities, takeover or "blue sky" laws, (ii) where failure to obtain such
consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or
notification, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (iii) as may be necessary as
a result of any facts or circumstances relating to the Seller or any of its
respective Affiliates or (iv) the BMA Consent.

 

Section 4.4 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Buyer has received and accepted an executed and binding commitment
letter dated as of the date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.
(collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), a correct and complete copy of which has
been provided to the Seller (as well as a redacted copy of the fee letter
related thereto), relating to the commitment of the Lenders to provide the
full amount of the debt financing stated therein on the terms contemplated
thereby and to pay all related fees and expenses. The debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Debt Financing_." The Buyer has received and accepted executed and
binding commitment letters dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity
Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Commitment Letters_ ") from Siris Partners II, L.P. (the " _Equity Investor_
"), correct and complete copies of which have been provided to the
Seller, relating to the commitment of the Equity Investor to provide the full
amount of the cash equity required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the terms contemplated thereby (the " _Equity Financing_
" and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ").

(b) Except as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Lenders or the Equity Investor to provide
the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders or the Equity
Investor to reduce the total amount of the Financing. Without limitation of
the foregoing, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the fee letter
entered into in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter, nor any other
agreement ancillary thereto, contains any direct or indirect condition
precedent to funding of the Financing. The Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letters, shall provide the Buyer with
acquisition financing on the Closing Date sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated
thereby. Assuming the satisfaction

 



28  of the conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.3, to the Knowledge of the Buyer,
there is no fact or occurrence as of the date hereof that would cause the
conditions to funding of the Financing not to be satisfied at or before the
Closing, and the Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by
it contained in the Commitment Letters.

 

(c) The Commitment Letters are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms, and are in full force and effect, and, as of the
date of this Agreement, and no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of
the Buyer under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, other
than any such default, breach or failure that has been waived in writing by
the Lenders or the applicable Equity Investor, as the case may be. No
Commitment Letter has been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived
on or prior to the date of this Agreement and, except as permitted by Section
5.3 with respect to actions by the Buyer, as of the Closing Date and the
respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, modified or rescinded on or prior to the date of this Agreement.
The Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees or
expenses required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters
on or before the date of this Agreement.

(d) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
the Buyer or any other financing be a condition to any of the Buyers
obligations hereunder.

Section 4.5 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Guarantor has delivered to the Seller the Guaranty. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Guarantor of the Guaranty and the consummation
by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action. The Guaranty has been
duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with its terms. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of the Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 

Section 4.6 _Brokers_. Except for Wells Fargo Securities LLC, the fees,
commissions and expenses of which will be paid by the Buyer, no broker,
financial advisor, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage,
financial advisors, finders or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of the Buyer or any of its Representatives.

Section 4.7 _Investment Intent_. The Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its
own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof or with any intention of selling, distributing or
otherwise disposing of the Shares in a manner that would violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "). The Buyer agrees that the Shares may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration under
the Securities Act and such laws. The Buyer is able to bear the economic risk
of holding the Shares for an indefinite period (including total loss of its
investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its
investment.

 



29 Section 4.8 _Buyer s Investigation and Reliance_. The Buyer is a
sophisticated purchaser and has made its own independent investigation,
review and analysis regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which investigation, review and analysis
were conducted by the Buyer together with expert advisors, including legal
counsel, that it has engaged for such purpose. The Buyer and its
Representatives have been provided with full and complete access to the
Representatives, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other information that
they have requested in connection with their investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer has not
relied and is not relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral
or written, express or implied, made by the Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules. None of the Seller, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have
any liability to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
resulting from the use of any information, documents or materials made
available to the Buyer, whether orally or in writing, in any confidential
information memoranda, "data rooms," management presentations, due diligence
discussions or in any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives is making, directly or
indirectly, any representation or warranty with respect to any estimates,
projections or forecasts involving the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Buyer acknowledges that there are inherent uncertainties in attempting to make
such estimates, projections and forecasts and that it takes full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of any such estimates, projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections and forecasts).
The Buyer acknowledges that, should the Closing occur, the Buyer shall acquire
the Company and its Subsidiaries on an "as is" and "where is" basis, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules. Nothing
in this Section 4.8 is intended to modify or limit any of the representations
or warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement.

Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford the Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access to the Representatives, properties, offices,
plants and other facilities, Contracts, books and records of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, and shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries

information as the Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at the Buyers
expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of the Companys
personnel and in such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with the
normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose any information to the Buyer or
its Representatives if such disclosure would reasonably be expected to (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene
any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date hereof.

 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Seller or any of its successors-in-interest (as it relates to
the Company and its Subsidiaries), for a period of seven years after the
Closing or, if shorter, the applicable period specified in the Buyers
document retention policy, the Buyer shall (i) retain the books and
records delivered to the Buyer relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to periods prior to the Closing and (ii) upon reasonable notice,
afford the Representatives of the Seller reasonable access (including the
right to make, at the Sellers expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such books and records; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
shall notify the Seller in writing at least 30 days in advance of destroying
any such books and records prior to the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date in order to provide the Seller the opportunity to copy such books and
records in accordance with this Section 5.2(b).

 

(c) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for a period
of seven years after the Closing or, if shorter, the applicable period
specified in the Sellers document retention policy, the Seller shall (i)
retain the books and records relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to periods prior to the Closing which shall not otherwise have been
delivered to the Buyer and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the

with this Section 5.2(c).

 



33 Section 5.3 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate, and obtain the proceeds of, the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including any
flex provisions applicable thereto), including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters; (ii) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing consistent with the terms and
conditions contained therein or on other terms (including any flex provisions
applicable thereto), no less favorable to the Seller (including with respect
to the conditionality thereof and the amount of proceeds thereunder), that
would not prevent, impede, delay or reasonably be expected to adversely impact
the ability of the Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, documents and agreements relating to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Section 2.2(b) hereof)
(any such agreements, the " _Financing Definitive Agreements_ ") and deliver
to the Seller a complete, correct and executed copy thereof as promptly as
practicable after execution thereof; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Buyer in the Commitment Letters or the Financing
Definitive Agreements; (iv) upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, consummate the Financing on or prior
to the Closing Date; and (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters
in the event of a breach by the Financing sources. The Buyer shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (x) permit any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letters or the Financing Definitive Agreements if such amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy (A) adds new (or modifies, in a manner adverse
to the Buyer, any existing) conditions or contingencies to the consummation of
the Financing, (B) reduces the amount thereof below the amount required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) adversely impacts the
ability of the Buyer or the Seller, as applicable, to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Financing Definitive
Agreements or otherwise materially and adversely impacts the Seller, or (D)
is reasonably likely to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (y) terminate or, to the extent within
its control, permit termination of any of the Commitment Letters or the
Financing Definitive Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein
shall prevent the Buyer from replacing or amending the Debt Commitment Letter
in order to add lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , that such addition does not, without the Sellers
consent, release any Financing source from its commitment to provide any
portion of the Financing unless a replacement Financing source set forth on
Section 5.3(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, or any other Financing source of
equal or greater creditworthiness, commits to provide such portion of the
Financing on terms and conditions materially no less favorable to the Seller.
The Buyer shall (I) give the Seller prompt notice of any breach or default by
any party to the Commitment Letters, the Financing Definitive Agreements or
any alternative debt financing of which the Buyer has become aware, any
purported termination or repudiation by any party of the Commitment Letters
or the Financing Definitive Agreements of which the Buyer has become aware or
upon receipt of notice of any material dispute or disagreement

 



34  between or among the parties to the Commitment Letters, the Financing
Definitive Agreements or any alternative debt financing and (II) otherwise
keep the Seller reasonably informed of the status of the Buyers efforts to
arrange the Financing (or replacement thereof).

(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing or any alternative
debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms thereof, regardless of the
reason therefor, the Buyer will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
as promptly as practicable (but in any event prior to the Termination
Date) alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with the proceeds from the Equity Financing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) on terms that are no less favorable, taken
as a whole, to the Buyer and that would not have any of the effects specified
in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) of the second sentence of Section 5.3(a) from
the same and/or other sources and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto (which agreements will be considered "Financing Definitive
Agreements"), and (ii) promptly notify the Seller of such unavailability and
the reason therefor. For purposes of this Section 5.3, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
as required or permitted to be replaced or substituted by this Section 5.3 and
references to "Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as required or
permitted to be replaced or substituted by this Section 5.3.

(c) The Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the respective Representatives
of the Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Buyer
all cooperation reasonably requested by the Buyer that is reasonably necessary
and customary to assist the Buyer in connection with the Buyer obtaining the
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation shall be done during
regular business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the Business or the Sellers or its Subsidiaries other businesses),
including:

(i) (A) causing, upon reasonable advance notice by the Buyer and on a
reasonable number of occasions, appropriate senior executive officers and
employees of the Company to be available on a customary basis for
participation in a reasonable number of meetings, including management and
other presentations and "road show" appearances, participation in due
diligence sessions, and the preparation of disclosure documents in connection
with the Financing; (B) assisting with the preparation of (x) an offering
memorandum, bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda and
similar documents, including "roadshow" or investor meeting slides required in
connection with the Debt Financing (including requesting (1) any consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing and (2) the delivery of one or more customary representation
letters) and (y) materials for rating agency presentations; (C) reasonably
cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Buyer and the Lenders for any
portion of the Debt Financing; (D) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate
the pledging, as of the Closing, of collateral in connection with the Debt
Financing; (E) causing the execution and delivery of any customary pledge
and security agreement, credit agreements, ancillary loan documents and
closing certificates (including definitive documentation) from those officers
(or holders of equivalent titles in non-US jurisdictions) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that are reasonably requested by Buyer and reasonably
required in connection with the Debt Financing (including (x) a certificate of
the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters as
of the Closing, on a pro forma basis and (y) delivering any backup officers
certificate

 



35  reasonably requested for a legal opinion), which will in each case not take
effect prior to the Closing; (F) providing to the Buyer and the Lenders at
least five Business Days prior to Closing (to the extent reasonably timely
requested by the Buyer or the Lenders) all documentation and other information
required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the
PATRIOT Act; and (G) taking, at the Closing, reasonably requested corporate
actions reasonably necessary to permit the completion of the Debt Financing;

 

(ii) using reasonable best effort to cause its independent accountants to
provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance to the Buyer (including
providing customary comfort letters with respect to the financial information
in any customary offering document relating to the Financing, including the
financial statements described in clause (iii) below);

 

(iii) using its reasonable best efforts to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
as promptly as possible the annual unaudited consolidated balance sheets of
the Company as of February 23, 2014, and the related unaudited statements of
operations, cash flows, and stockholders deficit for the year then ended, and
the notes and schedules thereto (the " _Unaudited 2014 Financial Statements_
"); and

(iv) furnishing the Buyer (which it may furnish to, and share with, the
Lenders) with (A) the Unaudited 2014 Financial Statements, (B) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of any quarterly
period following February 23, 2014 and ended no less than 45 days prior to the
Closing Date and the related unaudited statements of income, cash flows, and
stockholders deficit for the period then ended (and the comparable financial
information for the corresponding prior year interim period) and (C) all
financial, business and other pertinent information related to the Company
and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to produce the pro forma financial
statements required to be delivered pursuant to the Commitment Letters;

 

 _provided_ , in each case, that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
make any other payment other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs or incur any
other liability to any Person prior to the time of the Closing or provide or
agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing, or to commit to (1) take any action that is not contingent upon
the Closing (including the entry into any purchase agreement), or (2) take any
action that would result in any officer, director or other Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability with
respect to any matters relating to the Financing; _provided_ , _further_ that
all documentation and information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their Representatives under this Section 5.3(c) shall be held as
confidential under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) The Buyer shall, promptly upon request of the Seller, reimburse the
Seller and the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Seller, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with such cooperation; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall be
responsible for all costs incurred in connection with the actions contemplated
by Section 5.3(c)(iii) and Section 5.3(c)(iv)(A). The Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller, the Company and their Subsidiaries from and
against any and all

 



36  losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Seller, the Company or their Subsidiaries or
Representatives).

(e) The Seller, on behalf of itself and the Company and its Subsidiaries,
hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are not
used in a manner that is reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Seller,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their marks.

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party in writing of (i) any fact,
change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of
which it is aware that (A) would render any representation or warranty of the
Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement, if made on or immediately
following the date of such event, untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
or (B) will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set
forth in Article VII of this Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied,

immediately prior to the Closing:

writing, (x) all intercompany accounts involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller

party, in each case pursuant to termination agreements that are in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer;

 

(b) each Jefferies Agreement, without any consideration or further liability
to any party (except with respect to any amounts that may be due to Jefferies
LLC pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(v)), in each case pursuant to termination
agreements that are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer; and

 

(c) each Contract between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the recipient or payee of any Transaction Expense, without
any further liability to any party thereunder, in each case pursuant to
termination agreements, signed waivers or other similar arrangements
(including any invoice, payoff letter or similar written confirmation that
upon payment of the amount set forth thereon all amounts due or owing to such
recipient or payee shall have been paid in full) that are, in each case, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.

 

The termination agreements, waivers or other similar arrangements referred to
in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above are collectively referred to herein as the
" _Termination Agreements_ ".

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation_. If this Agreement is terminated prior
to Closing, the Buyer will not, for a period of three years thereafter,
without the prior written consent of the

 



37  Seller, solicit any person who is an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, at the date hereof or at any time hereafter that precedes such
termination, to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the foregoing provisions shall not
prohibit the solicitation or employment of any such person (i) resulting from
general advertisements for employment or recruitment efforts conducted by any
recruitment agency, provided that such advertisements or recruitment efforts
are not directed at such person or (ii) that occurs at least six months
following cessation of such persons employment with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. The Buyer agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by
the Buyer of this Section 5.6 would be inadequate, and that the Seller and the
Company would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is
ever held that this restriction on the Buyer is too onerous and is not
necessary for the protection of the Company, the Buyer agrees that any court
of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser restrictions which such court
may consider to be necessary or appropriate properly to protect the Company.

Section 5.7 _Bank Accounts; Resignations_.

 

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, except to the extent the Buyer shall otherwise
direct the Seller in writing, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer copies of
effective revocations of all prior authorizations of any employee of the
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to sign
checks, deal with bank or investment accounts of, or with respect to, the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The Seller shall ensure that cash generated by
the Company or its Subsidiaries is not deposited to any account of the Seller
or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, and if so deposited, shall
ensure that such cash is promptly forwarded to appropriate accounts of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company will deliver at the Closing the resignation of all of the
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, effective as of the Closing,
except for such directors that the Buyer specifies in writing to the Company
prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.8 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, hold all documents and information furnished to it by or
on behalf of another party in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality agreement dated November
25, 2013 between Siris Capital Group, LLC and the Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing Date, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of the parties under this Section 5.8 shall terminate. If for any
reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.9 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, including to obtain from Governmental Authorities
and other Persons the BMA Consent and all other material consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders which, to the Knowledge of the
Company,

 



38  are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with taking, or causing
to be taken, all such action contemplated by this Section 5.9(a), none of the
Buyer, the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
incur any out-of-pocket costs or any other obligation or liability unless de
minimis in nature.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertaking pursuant to
Section 5.9(a), the Buyer agrees to use its best efforts and to take any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties
hereto to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
no later than the Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divesture or disposition of its assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it
pursuant hereto as are required to be divested in order to avoid any
injunction (or to effect the dissolution thereof), temporary restraining
order or other order or decision in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of such transactions. In addition, the Buyer shall use its best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing by the Termination Date.

(c) Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other parties of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. No party to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties will provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts to which the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is a party that have not been and may
not be obtained. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including any officer, director, shareholder, member or employee
thereof) shall have any liability to the Buyer or its Affiliates arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the termination of any contract (or customer or other business
or commercial relationship) as a result thereof, and no such failure or
termination shall result in the failure of any condition set forth in Article
VII; _provided_ , that the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9(d) shall
in no way limit the obligations of the Seller to use the efforts required of
it under Section 5.9(a).

 



39 (e) On and after the Closing Date, each of the parties shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may be imposed on any party with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, promptly cooperate with and
furnish information to any other party hereto in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon such other party, and obtain and make promptly (and
promptly cooperate with the other parties in obtaining or making) any
applicable consent, authorization, order or approval of, or registration,
declaration, or filing with, or exemption by, any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the taking
of any action contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
the termination of the registration of the Senior Secured Notes under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the general rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The parties shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
party shall issue any press release or make any public statement prior to
obtaining each other partys written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the
extent disclosure may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement
of any party hereto; provided that prior to any such disclosure, the Buyer (in
the event of any proposed disclosure by the Seller) or the Seller (in the
event of any proposed disclosure by the Buyer) shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure.

 

Section 5.11 _Release of Guarantees_. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the
Seller or its Affiliates that are a party to each of the Seller Guarantees.

Section 5.12 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing)
arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual Action based in whole
or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Closing Date (the " _D andO Indemnified Liabilities_"),
including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent a
corporation is permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own directors
or officers (and the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such
action or proceeding to each 

 



40  DandO Indemnified Party). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any
DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Closing Date), (i)
the DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO
Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii) the
Buyer, the Company, its Subsidiaries and each DandO Indemnified Party will use
all reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter;
_provided_ , that neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor the Buyer
shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any DandO Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.12 shall promptly notify
the Buyer upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party
from any liability which it may have under this Section 5.12 except to the
extent such failure prejudices such party). The parties hereto agree that all
rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances
of expenses incurred in defense of any such action or suit, existing in favor
of the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring through the
Closing Date shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six years from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such DandO Indemnified Liabilities. 

(b) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, the Buyer shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Company
to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are at least as favorable as
the policy currently in effect with respect to actions and omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Closing,
the Buyer shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies
in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 200% of the
current annual premium paid by the Company in respect of the coverage required
to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the Company purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 200% of the current annual premium, the Company shall
purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 200% of the
current annual premium. The fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such "tail policy" shall be paid by Buyer and shall not be deemed a
Transaction Expense.

(c) Except as may be required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall not permit
the Company to take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or
adversely affect the provisions of the articles of organization and bye-laws
and any other written agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
provide indemnification of and expense reimbursement to DandO Indemnified
Parties.

Section 5.13 _Payoff Letters_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Buyer fully executed payoff
letters, each in customary form, from the agents (or lenders) under the
Companys Indebtedness to be paid off at the Closing pursuant to Section
2.2(b) (other than the Indebtedness under the Indenture) (each such letter, a
" _Payoff_

 



41   _Letter_ "), it being agreed that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such Payoff Letters as least three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. Each Payoff Letter shall (i) indicate the total amount
required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment
premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar obligations under the terms of
such Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (" _Payoff Amount_ "),
(ii) state that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount, the instrument evidencing
such Indebtedness shall be terminated and any share certificates and other
physical collateral shall be returned, and (iii) state that all Encumbrances
and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to the assets and
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be, upon the
payment of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, released and terminated.
Each of the Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause the Companys
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and take
all other commercially reasonable actions, including with respect to the
backstop or termination of any letters of credit issued under the Companys
Indebtedness to facilitate the termination of commitments thereunder, the
repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding thereunder (using funds
arranged by the Buyer) and the release of all Encumbrances and termination of
all guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date.

furnish to any other Person any non-public information with respect to, or
otherwise assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate or encourage the
submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Seller and the Company immediately
shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall request (to the extent empowered to do so) all such
Persons to promptly return or destroy all confidential information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries previously delivered thereto. The Seller
shall notify the Buyer promptly, but in any event within 24 hours, in writing
if any Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry by any Person with respect
thereto, is made. Such notice to the Buyer shall indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry
and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
The Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to,
release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
that applies to confidential information of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company, the Seller and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives may (x) have discussions with any current debt or
equity holders of the Seller in connection with seeking consents or approvals
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) take
appropriate actions in preparation for and consummate the issuances of equity

shall mail to its shareholders a

 



42  consent, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approvals, as required under
the Laws of Bermuda and the Sellers Bye-Laws, and to amend the Sellers Bye-
Laws to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the
requirement described in Section 3.2(c)(ii)(B). From and after the date
hereof, the Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed regarding the
status of the Shareholder Approvals, including providing updates, upon the
Buyers reasonable request, as to the number of consents obtained and any
material communications between the Seller or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and any direct or indirect shareholder of the Seller, on the
other hand, regarding the Shareholder Approvals. The Seller shall provide
copies of the Shareholder Approvals to the Buyer promptly upon receipt.

hereby are exempt from withholding pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.

hold the Seller harmless against, any transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax,
stock transfer tax or similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), together with any interest, penalties or additions to
such Transfer Taxes. The Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in timely making
all filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to

service provider to, the Company or its Subsidiaries who is, or would
reasonably be expected to be as of the Closing Date, a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall cause the Company to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to seek to have any such individual waive any payments or economic
benefit pursuant to any Employee Plan and any agreement, in each case, entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such disqualified
individual prior to the Closing Date that such individual is entitled in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or in combination with any other event) that could constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code) with
respect to such individual. If any individual waives his or her rights to
payments or economic benefits as described in the previous sentence, the
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain or cause
the Company to

 



43  obtain shareholder approval in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and in a manner that satisfies the applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder; provided that in no event shall this Section 6.3 be
construed to require the Seller to compel any Person to waive any existing
rights under any Contract that such Person has with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and in no event shall the Seller be deemed in breach of this
Section 6.3 if any such Person refuses to waive any such rights or such
shareholder approval is not obtained. Within a reasonable period of
time before taking such actions, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer for
review and comment copies of any documents or agreements necessary to effect
this Section 6.3, including, but not limited to, any shareholder consent form,
disclosure statement, or waiver, and the Seller shall consider in good faith
all comments received from the Buyer on such documents and agreements.

termination, to the Seller the Reverse Termination Fee, in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in United States dollars, to an
account designated by the Seller. In the event that the Seller shall have

agrees that the remedy provided for in the prior sentence of this Section
10.1(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller against the Buyer
or any Buyer Related Party arising from, and such amounts shall constitute
liquidated damages in respect of, a Specified Termination and in no event will
the Seller seek to recover any money damages or seek any other remedy based
on a claim in law or equity, or through attempting piercing of the corporate
or similar veil, or by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract tort
or otherwise, or by any other means, with respect to any Specified
Termination; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
reimburse the Seller for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates, if any,
in connection with enforcing payment of the Reverse Termination Fee. The Buyer
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.1(a) are an

(b) In the event that the Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(ii), solely with respect to a breach of Section 5.14 or Section 5.15
triggering such termination, or Section 9.1(f) (such termination, a "
_Shareholder Approval Termination_ "), the Seller, the Company and Stratus US
shall be jointly and severally responsible for paying promptly, but in any
event no later than two Business Days, (i) following such termination, to the
Buyer the Company Termination Fee, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in United States dollars, to an account designated by the
Buyer, and (ii) following the request of the Buyer accompanied by appropriate
documentation of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, to the Buyer
the Buyer Expense Reimbursement, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in United States dollars, to an account designated by the
Buyer. In the event that the Buyer shall have actually received full payment
of the Company Termination Fee and the Buyer Expense Reimbursement, the Buyer
agrees that the remedy provided for in the prior sentence of this Section
10.1(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer against the
Company, the Seller, Stratus US or any of their current, former or future
officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates arising from, and such
amounts shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of, a Shareholder
Approval Termination and in no event will the Buyer seek to recover any other
remedy based on a claim in law or equity, or through attempting piercing of
the corporate or similar veil, or by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in
contract tort or otherwise, or by any other means, with respect to any
Shareholder Approval Termination; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller, the Company or Stratus US shall reimburse the Buyer for
all out of pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Buyer or its Affiliates, if any, in connection with enforcing
payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Buyer Expense Reimbursement. The
Seller, the Company and Stratus US acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 10.1(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Buyer would not enter into
this Agreement.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with or related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

 



49 Section 10.2 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or
otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an

the contrary contained herein, Sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.7, 10.8, 10.12,
10.13(b) and 10.16 may not be modified or amended in a manner that is adverse
in any material respect to any Lender without the prior written consent of
such Lender.

 

Section 10.3 _Waiver_. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any
right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right or power. Any agreement on the part of any party to any
such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed
and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party.

the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 10.13 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any
appropriate New York State or federal court), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that the Seller shall be entitled to specific performance
of the Buyers obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2 if and only in the event
that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied
or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and with respect to the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2, solely for purposes of consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, waived (other than such
conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that such conditions are capable of being satisfied
at the time of the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the
terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing,
(iii) the Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing
otherwise would have been required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2
and (iv) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.2 (but
solely for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and the Closing pursuant to Section 2.2 will occur. For purposes of
this Section 10.13(a), references to "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as required or permitted to
be replaced or substituted by Section 5.3.

 



54 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Buyer for any Losses of the Seller or the Company
relating to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated, a breach by the Buyer of this Agreement or otherwise shall be
limited to the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee (if due), plus the sum
of all out of pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates in connection with enforcing payment
of the Reverse Termination Fee (if due) (the " _Liability Limitation_ "), and
in no event shall the Seller or any of its Affiliates seek any amount in
excess of the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Seller agrees that in connection
with this Agreement it has no right of recovery against, and no personal
liability shall attach to any former, current or future direct or indirect
equityholder, controlling person, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, Equity
Investor or assignee of the Buyer or any Lender or Lender Related Party (each,
a " _Buyer Related Party_ "), through the Buyer or otherwise, whether by or
through attempting piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Buyer
against any Buyer Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether
in contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the
Guarantor (but not any other Buyer Related Party) under and to the extent
provided in the Guaranty and subject to the Liability Limitation and
the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under
the Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller and its
Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Buyer Related Party (other than
the Buyer to the extent provided in this Agreement) in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the
Seller against the Buyer hereunder, in no event shall the Seller or any of
its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against or seek to recover damages from, any Buyer
Related Party (other than against the Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty and
subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described
therein). For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Seller
or the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a grant
of specific performance of the obligation to close contemplated by Section
10.13(a) that results in the Closing being consummated and (B) any money
damages, including the Reverse Termination Fee (if due).

 

Section 10.14 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

Section 10.15 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

 



55 Section 10.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING.

 

Section 10.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

 

Section 10.18 _Facsimile or .pdf Signature_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall
constitute an original for all purposes.

Section 10.19 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.20 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Only the Seller and the Company shall be considered clients of Gibson,
Dunn and Crutcher LLP (" _Gibson Dunn_ ") in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "). The
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company) acknowledges and agrees that all confidential communications
between the Seller or the Company and Gibson Dunn in the course of the
Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product protection, and expectation of client confidentiality applicable
thereto, shall be deemed to belong solely to the Seller and not the Company,
and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by the Buyer or the Company
upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, the Buyer shall not have access to
any such communications, or to the files of Gibson Dunn relating to the
Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent
that files of Gibson Dunn in respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute
property of the client, only the Seller shall hold such property rights and
(ii) Gibson Dunn shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Company or the Buyer by reason
of any attorney-client relationship between Gibson Dunn and the Company or
otherwise; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Gibson Dunn
shall not disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any
third parties (other than representatives, accountants and advisors of the
Seller; provided, that such representatives, accounts and advisors are
instructed to maintain the confidence of such attorney-
client communications).

(b) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company) acknowledges and agrees that Gibson Dunn has acted as
counsel for the Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates for
several years and that the Seller reasonably anticipates that Gibson Dunn will
continue to represent it and/or such other parties in future matters.
Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company) expressly consents to Gibson Dunns
representation of the Seller and/or

 



56  its Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the
foregoing Persons so desire) in any matter, including, without limitation, any
post-Closing matter in which the interests of the Buyer and the Company, on
the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse, including any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and whether or not such matter is one in which Gibson Dunn
may have previously advised the Seller, the Company or their respective
Affiliates.

(c) From and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-
client relationship with Gibson Dunn, unless and to the extent Gibson Dunn is
expressly engaged in writing by the Company to represent the Company after the
Closing and either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of interest with
respect to the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates or (ii) the Seller and/or
any such Affiliate, as applicable, consent in writing to such engagement. Any
such representation of the Company by Gibson Dunn after the Closing shall not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof. Furthermore, Gibson Dunn, in its sole
discretion, shall be permitted to withdraw from representing the Company in
order to represent or continue so representing the Seller.

 

(d) The Seller, the Company and the Buyer consent to the arrangements in this
