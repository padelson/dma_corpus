of the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.1.1(b)_ on the same day
as the commencement of the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.1.1(a)_,
then, in such circumstance, LBHI and Seller shall have the right to elect, by
written notice to the Buyer Parties given within thirty (30) days following
the alleged breach hereunder by the Buyer Parties, either to pursue all
remedies at Law and equity available

 



       
 

 



 

against ERPOP and AVB, who shall be jointly and severally liable therefor, or
to receive the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount pursuant to _Section 15.3_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if LBHI and Seller do not elect to pursue such
additional remedies at Law or equity and instead to receive the Seller
Liquidated Damages Amount, then LBHI and Seller shall not be entitled to
pursue, and shall be forever precluded from pursuing, such additional
remedies.

 



 

2.1.2 at the Initial Closing, (i) LBHI agrees to cause REPE Archstone GP
Holdings, LLC, ACQ SPV I Holdings LLC and ACQ SPV II Paper LLC (collectively,
the " _Voting Interest Parties_ ") **** to sell, assign, transfer, convey and

at the Initial Closing, (a) (i) ERPOP or the applicable Buyer Designee shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an aggregate amount in cash equal to
$2,016,000,000 (the " _ERPOP Cash Purchase Price Portion_ "), (ii) AVB or the
applicable Buyer Designee shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an
aggregate amount in cash equal to $669,000,000 (the " _AVB Cash Purchase Price

_Cash Purchase Price_ "), (iii) ERPOP shall deliver, or cause its Buyer
Designees to deliver, to Seller (or, if so directed by Seller, to LBHI or a
Lehman Designee) the ERPOP Equity Consideration, and (iv) AVB shall deliver,

a Lehman Designee) the AVB Equity Consideration; and (b) one or more Buyer

2.2.1_ and _Section 2.2.2_. The Cash Purchase Price shall be paid as provided

shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the Cash Purchase Price, ERPOP
Equity Consideration and AVB

 



      
 

 



 

Equity Consideration to Seller (or LBHI or a Lehman Designee, as applicable)
and shall be jointly and severally liable for the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

2.2.2 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each
applicable Buyer Designee shall assume, by execution and delivery of an
Assumption Agreement, (a) effective as of the Initial Closing (with respect to
all Transferred Assets and Transferred Subsidiary Assets to be acquired by

Extension Closing in accordance with _Section 2.5_), and (b) effective as of
any Extension Closing (with respect to the applicable Deferred Closing Assets
subject to an Extension Closing) in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and shall
pay, perform and discharge when due, each of the Assumed Liabilities related
to the applicable Deferred Closing Assets. The Buyer Parties shall not assume
and shall not be responsible to pay, perform or discharge any of the Excluded

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

2.3.1

 



 

(a) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, EQR declares or makes a dividend
or distribution of EQR Common Shares on EQR Common Shares with a record date
or, if no record date, an effective date prior to the Initial Closing Date, or
AVB declares or makes a dividend or distribution of AVB Common Shares on AVB
Common Shares with a record date, or, if no record date, an effective date
prior to the Initial Closing, or (ii) either EQR or AVB announces or effects a
share split or share combination with a record date or, if no record date, an
effective date prior to the Initial Closing Date, then the number of EQR
Common Shares or AVB Common Shares, as the case may, to be delivered as part
of the Purchase Price shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

 



    

TS1

 |  



 |  

=

 |  



 |  

TS0 x OS1/OS0 

---|---|---|---|--- 
   



 |  



 |  



 |  



 |  


 
   

Where 

   


 
   

TS0

 |  



 |  

=

 |  



 |  

the number of EQR Common Shares or AVB Common Shares, as the case may be,
deliverable hereunder immediately prior to the adjustment relating to such
event 

   



 |  



 |  



 |  



 |  


 
   

TS1

 |  



 |  

=

 |  



 |  

the new number of EQR Common Shares or AVB Common Shares, as the case may be,
deliverable hereunder taking such event into account 

   



 |  



 |  



 |  



 |  


 
   

OS0

 |  



 |  

=

 |  



 |  

the number of EQR Common Shares or AVB Common 

 



      
 

 



    



 |  



 |  



 |  



 |  

Shares, as the case may be, outstanding immediately prior to such event 

---|---|---|---|--- 
   



 |  



 |  



 |  



 |  


 
   

OS1

 |  



 |  

=

 |  



 |  

the number of EQR Common Shares or AVB Common Shares, as the case may be,
outstanding immediately after such event. 

 



 

(b) If at any time after the date of this Agreement, either EQR or AVB
declares or makes a cash dividend or distribution (other than one or more cash
dividends declared in the Ordinary Course of Business) with a record date or,
if no record date, an effective date, prior to the Initial Closing Date, the
EQR Cash Purchase Price Portion or the AVB Cash Purchase Price Portion, as the
case may be, will be increased by an amount equal to the amount of such
dividend or distribution that Seller would have received if the Initial
Closing Date had occurred immediately prior to the record date or effective
date for such dividend (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any
corresponding adjustment to the ERPOP Equity Consideration or the AVB Equity
Consideration, but the result of the increased EQR Cash Purchase Price Portion
or AVB Cash Purchase Price Portion shall be a corresponding increase in the
Purchase Price). If at any time after the date of this Agreement, either EQR
or AVB declares or makes a dividend or distribution (other than a cash
dividend or stock dividend (which is adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3.1(a)_)
that involves property, rights, securities, debt obligations or any other
matter, then the Purchase Price will be increased by the property, rights,
securities, debt obligations or other forms that Seller would have received if
the Initial Closing Date had occurred immediately prior to the record date or
effective date for such dividend or distribution (with such increase in the
Purchase Price being payable in the form of the applicable property, rights,
securities, debt obligations or other forms that Seller would have received if
the Initial Closing Date had occurred immediately prior to the record date or
effective date for such dividend or distribution). A cash dividend shall be
deemed to be in the Ordinary Course of Business if, and only if, it is (i) in
respect of the fourth (4th) quarter of 2012, less than the amount set forth
for EQR or AVB, as applicable, on _Schedule 2.3.1(a)_ , or (b) in respect of
2013, made in accordance with ordinary course past practices and announced as
the expected "run rate" for dividends, in respect of EQR, for the first three
(3) calendar quarters of 2013 and, in respect of AVB, for all of 2013.

 



 

(c) If after the date of this Agreement either the EQR Common Shares or AVB
Common Shares are changed, altered or modified by reason of recapitalization,
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or otherwise (an "
_Event_ ") (other than by reason of the events described in _Section
2.3.1(a)_ or _(b)_ ), and such change, alteration or modification has a record
date or, if no record date, an effective date prior to the Initial Closing
Date, then the ERPOP Equity Consideration or AVB Equity

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration, as applicable, shall be changed, altered or modified as if the
ERPOP Equity Consideration or AVB Equity Consideration were outstanding as of
the record date or effective date for such Event.

 



 

2.3.2 In the event that the Initial Closing Date occurs on a date that is
later than the Second Extension Date, then the Cash Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount in cash (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any
corresponding adjustment to the ERPOP Equity Consideration or the AVB Equity
Consideration, but the result of the increased Cash Purchase Price shall be a
corresponding increase in the Purchase Price) equal to (a) $1,000,000 for each
day beginning on the day following the Second Extension Date to and including
the Initial Closing Date ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
there be any increase in the Cash Purchase Price with respect to any day
during the period (x) beginning on the date that is five (5) Business Days
following the date that the Buyer Parties have delivered a written notice in
accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ that the Buyer Parties intend that the
Initial Closing shall occur to the extent that, as of such date that is five
(5) Business Days following the date on which the Buyer Parties have delivered
such notice, the conditions set forth in Section _11.1.1_ , _11.1.2_ and
_11.1.3_ have been satisfied and the conditions set forth in _Sections 10.1.1_
, _10.1.2_ and _10.1.3_ (except to the extent waived by the Buyer Parties, in
their sole and absolute discretion) shall not have been satisfied, and (y)
ending on the date on which the conditions set forth in _Sections 10.1.1_ ,
_10.1.2_ and _10.1.3_ have been satisfied), _minus_ (b) an amount in cash
equal to any cash dividends or distributions that will be received by Seller
(or, if directed by Seller, LBHI or a Lehman Designee) at or following the
Initial Closing with respect to the ERPOP Equity Consideration or the AVB
Equity Consideration and which accrued with respect to any period ending on or
before the Initial Closing Date (but the amount in clause (b) shall not exceed
the amount payable as an increase in the Cash Purchase Price Portion pursuant
to clause (a)). For purposes of clarity, the amount payable in accordance with
this _Section 2.3.2_, if any, shall be the joint and several obligations of
ERPOP and AVB, but may be allocated among the Buyer Parties as determined by
the Buyer Parties in their sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

2.3.3 On the Initial Closing Date or any earlier date selected by Seller, all
Derivative Instruments to which Archstone, Seller or any Archstone Entity is
bound shall be unwound or terminated, as the case may be, and the Cash
Purchase Price shall be positively or negatively adjusted on a dollar-for-
dollar basis (i.e., if such adjustment is positive, the Cash Purchase Price
shall be increased, and if such adjustment is negative, the Cash Purchase
Price shall be decreased (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any
corresponding adjustment to the ERPOP Equity Consideration or the AVB Equity
Consideration, but the result of the increased or decreased Cash Purchase
Price shall be a corresponding increase or decrease in the Purchase Price)) to
reflect the difference between the values of such Derivative Instruments used
in the preparation of the Archstone Entities June 30, 2012 financial
statements and amounts received as a result of unwinding or terminating such
Derivative Instruments; _provided_ that such Derivative Instruments will not
be

 



      
 

 



 

required to be unwound or terminated to the extent that (x) prior to the
Initial Closing, the applicable Derivative Instruments have been assigned by
Seller or the applicable Archstone Entity to LBHI or a Lehman Designee and
LBHI or the applicable Lehman Designee shall have assumed the obligations of
the applicable Archstone Entity thereunder, (y) at the Initial Closing, LBHI
has executed and delivered to the Buyer Parties a release in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer Parties releasing the Buyer
Parties, their Affiliates and the Archstone Entities and their respective
Representatives from all Liabilities related to such Derivative Instrument and
agreeing to indemnify Buyer Parties, their Affiliates and the Archstone
Entities and their respective Representatives from and against all Losses
relating to such Derivative Instrument, and (z) at the Initial Closing, the
Cash Purchase Price shall have been positively or negatively adjusted on a
dollar-for-dollar basis (i.e., if the value of such Derivative Instrument is
positive, the Cash Purchase Price shall be decreased, and if the value of such
Derivative Instrument is negative, the Cash Purchase Price shall be increased
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any corresponding adjustment to the
ERPOP Equity Consideration or the AVB Equity Consideration, but the result of
the increased or decreased Cash Purchase Price shall be a corresponding
increase or decrease in the Purchase Price)) to reflect the value of such
Derivative Instruments used in the preparation of the Archstone Entities June
30, 2012 financial statements. For purposes of clarity, the amount payable by
or to the Buyer Parties in accordance with this _Section 2.3.3_, as
applicable, shall be the joint and several obligations of ERPOP and AVB, but
may be allocated among the Buyer Parties or the Buyer Designees as determined
by the Buyer Parties in their sole and absolute discretion. For the avoidance
of doubt, ERPOP and AVB shall be responsible for any non-compliance, violation
or breach of any Contract relating to Indebtedness or Joint Ventures resulting
from the unwinding, termination or breach of any Derivative Instrument in
connection with this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

2.4 _Initial Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to _Article 15_ and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Articles 9_, _10_ and _11_ (excluding those
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied as part of the Initial
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), the
initial closing of the Contemplated Transactions (the " _Initial Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP, 875 3rd Avenue, New
York, New York, 10022 at 9:00 a.m., New York time, on or before the Outside
Closing Date. The Buyer Parties may fix the Initial Closing Date as any
Business Day prior to the Outside Closing Date (a) upon written notice (which
notice may be rescinded in the Buyer Parties sole discretion) to Seller and
LBHI delivered at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the Initial
Closing Date selected by Buyer Parties (and if the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ are not satisfied or waived on such date, the Initial Closing
Date shall be the first date on which all of the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ are satisfied or waived), or (b) at such other place, time or
date as the Parties hereto may agree in writing, in each case, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Articles 9_, _10_ and
_11_ (excluding those conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied as
part of the Initial Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions). The " _Outside Closing Date_ " shall mean the

 



      
 

 



 

date which is sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement; _provided_
that the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Buyer Parties may determine,
in their sole discretion, to postpone (i) upon notice (the " _First Extension
Notice_ ") to Seller and LBHI delivered by either of the Buyer Parties or both
of them prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the date
which is sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement, the Outside
Closing Date to a date that is no later than ninety (90) days after the date
of this Agreement, and (ii) upon notice (the " _Second Extension Notice_ ") to
Seller and LBHI delivered by either of the Buyer Parties or both of them prior
to the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the date which is ninety
(90) days following the date of this Agreement, the Outside Closing Date to a
date that is no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that the Buyer
Parties have not delivered either (I) a First Extension Notice or a Second
Extension Notice, as applicable, within the time periods specified in clause
(i) or (ii), as applicable, (II) a notice setting the Initial Closing Date in
accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ that has not been rescinded, or (III) a
notice affirmatively stating the Buyer Parties do not wish to extend the
Outside Closing Date, then the First Extension Notice or the Second Extension
Notice, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been delivered to Seller and
LBHI in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ and the Outside Closing Date shall
be deemed to have been extended to the First Extension Date or the Second
Extension Date, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the Buyer
Parties may not extend the Outside Closing Date to a date that is beyond 120
days after the date of this Agreement under any circumstances (but LBHI and
Seller shall have the right, in their sole discretion, to extend the Outside
Closing Date by up to twenty (20) Business Days in order to cure any default
by LBHI or Seller as provided in _Section 15.1.3(a)_); (y) in the event that
the Initial Closing does not occur on or before the First Extension Date, then
the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount shall increase to an amount in cash equal
to $800,000,000; and (z) if the Initial Closing does not occur on or before
the Second Extension Date, then the Purchase Price shall increase as set forth
in _Section 2.3.2_. In the event the Buyer Parties do not fix the Initial
Closing Date, the Initial Closing Date shall be the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day after the date of this Agreement, and the Buyer Parties shall be
in breach of this Agreement if the Initial Closing does not occur on or before
the one hundred twentieth (120th) day after the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that the conditions set forth in Articles 9 and 10 have been
satisfied on such date (except to the extent waived by the Buyer Parties or
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied as part of the Initial
Closing).

 



 

2.5 _Deferred Closings_.

 



 

2.5.1 In the event that (A) any Deferred Closing Asset Consent required in
connection with any of the assets of the Archstone Entities set forth on
_Schedule 2.5.1_ has not been obtained on or prior to the Initial Closing
Date and the Buyer Parties have elected pursuant to the provisions below to
postpone the purchase thereof, (B) there is an Order issued by a Governmental
Authority in effect on the Initial Closing Date (an " _Asset Transfer
Restriction Order_ ") preventing or prohibiting the transfer of any asset of
the Archstone Entities to the Buyer Parties, or (C) with respect to a real
property asset located in Montgomery County, Maryland, a certificate of
compliance with respect to the applicable Tenant Purchase Option Law has not
been obtained as of the Initial Closing Date and the Buyer Parties have
concluded that an exemption from the requirement to obtain a certificate of
compliance is not

 



      
 

 



 

available (all such assets described in clauses (A) through (C) being referred
to as " _Deferred Closing Assets_ "), then (i) the purchase by the Buyer
Parties of any Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset and any Deferred
Closing Asset with respect to which an Asset Transfer Restriction Order is in
effect shall be postponed, and (ii) the Buyer Parties may elect, in their sole
discretion, by written notice delivered to Seller within five (5) Business
Days prior to the Initial Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.5_, to postpone the purchase by the Buyer
Parties of any of the other Deferred Closing Assets, in each case, to a date
following the Initial Closing Date that is no later than the Outside Deferred
Closing Date, and which date shall be no later than three (3) Business Days
following the date on which (x) the applicable Deferred Closing Asset Consent
with respect to the applicable Deferred Closing Asset has actually been
received, (y) the Asset Transfer Restriction Order with respect to the
applicable Deferred Closing Assets is no longer in effect, or (z) the
applicable certificate of compliance is received with respect to the
applicable Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset, whichever may be
applicable (each such closing of the purchase of the applicable Deferred
Closing Asset by a Buyer Party, an " _Extension Closing_ " and, the date on
which any such Extension Closing actually occurs, an " _Extension Closing
Date_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, _Schedule 2.5.1_ shall not be modified
except as expressly set forth in _Section 9.2_.

 



 

2.5.2 In the event the closing of any Deferred Closing Assets is postponed in
accordance with _Section 2.5.1_, the following provisions shall apply:

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Initial Closing, the Parties shall (i) cause such
Deferred Closing Assets to be transferred to Seller or another entity mutually
agreed upon by ERPOP, AVB and LBHI in accordance with _Schedule 2.6_ such
that the applicable Deferred Closing Assets shall be excluded from the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets being transferred to
the Buyer Parties at or immediately prior to the Initial Closing, and (ii)
cause the actions set forth on _Schedule 2.6_ to be modified so as to enable
the Initial Closing to occur without transfer of the Deferred Closing Assets
(x) with respect to which the applicable Deferred Closing Asset Consents have
not been obtained and for which the Buyer Parties have elected to postpone the
purchase thereof as provided herein, (y) with respect to which an Asset
Transfer Restriction Order is in effect, or (z) with respect to which a
certificate of compliance has not been received for any Montgomery County
Deferred Closing Asset, in each case, as of the Initial Closing Date.

 



 

(b) (i) The applicable Buyer Party shall, at the Initial Closing, deposit into
an escrow account with an **** escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Parties
(the " _Escrow Agent_ ") a portion of the ERPOP Equity Consideration or the
AVB Equity Consideration, as applicable (the " _Escrowed Deferred Stock
Consideration_ "), in an amount equal to the amount allocated to the

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Deferred Closing Asset (which allocated amount is set forth
opposite such Deferred Closing Asset on _Schedule 2.5.1_); _provided_ that
there shall be no Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration deposited with the
Escrow Agent with respect to any Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset,
unless the aggregate value of Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration would be
less than $50 million, in which event the aggregate Escrowed Deferred Stock
Consideration to be deposited with the Escrow Agent with respect to all such
Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets shall be equal to the number of EQR
Common Shares and/or number of AVB Common Shares (as applicable) allocated to
the applicable Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset(s) (which allocated
amount is set forth opposite such Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset on
_Schedule 2.5.1_); _provided_ _however_ , that if the aggregate value of such
EQR Common Shares and AVB Common Shares (the " _Montgomery County Escrowed
Share Value_ ") is in excess of an amount equal to $50 million less the
aggregate value of the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration with respect to
all other Deferred Closing Assets (such amount the " _Montgomery County
Escrowed Consideration Limit_ "), then the number of EQR Common Shares and
number of AVB Common Shares shall be reduced in proportion to the relative
value represented by the aggregate number of EQR Common Shares and AVB Common
Shares allocated to all such Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets, until
the Montgomery County Escrowed Share Value does not exceed the Montgomery
County Escrowed Consideration Limit. Any fractional shares as a result of
determining the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration shall be rounded to the
nearest whole share. For purposes of valuing the Escrowed Deferred Stock
Consideration or any component thereof, the EQR Common Shares shall be deemed
to have a value of $58.75 per share and the AVB Common Shares shall be deemed
to have a value of $136.00 per share;

 



 

(ii) the ERPOP Equity Consideration or AVB Equity Consideration, as
applicable, payable to Seller (or, if so directed by Seller, to LBHI or a
Lehman Designee) at the Initial Closing in accordance with _Section 2.2.1_
shall be reduced by the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration delivered to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with clause (i) above; and

 



 

(iii) the Parties shall (and LBHI shall cause the applicable Archstone
Entities to) deliver to the Escrow Agent executed but undated originals of all
documents and other deliverables (including Assumption Agreements effecting
the assumption by the Buyer Parties or applicable Buyer Designee of Assumed
Liabilities relating to such Deferred Closing Asset) necessary to cause the
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Deferred Closing
Assets to the applicable Buyer Party and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities relating to such Deferred Closing Assets following the earlier to
occur of (x) no later than the third Business

 



      
 

 



 

Day following the date on which (1) the applicable Deferred Closing Asset
Consents have actually been received, (2) the Asset Transfer Restriction
Orders relating to the applicable Deferred Closing Assets are no longer in
effect, or (3) the applicable certificates of compliance are received with
respect to the applicable Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets, whichever
may be applicable, and (y) the Outside Deferred Closing Date (the " _Escrowed
Deferred Closing Asset Transfer Documents_ ").

 



 

(c) Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections
10.2_ and _11.2_ and subject further to _Section 2.5.2(g)_, the Parties shall
provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to (i) release the
Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration (together with any dividends received
with respect thereto) relating to each Deferred Closing Asset from escrow, and
(ii) deliver the applicable Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration (together
with any dividends received with respect thereto) to Seller (or, if so
directed by Seller, to LBHI or a Lehman Designee), upon the earlier to occur
of (x) no later than the third Business Day following the date on which (1)
the applicable Deferred Closing Asset Consent relating to the applicable
Deferred Closing Asset is actually received, (2) the Asset Transfer
Restriction Order relating to the applicable Deferred Closing Asset is no
longer in effect, or (3) the applicable certificate of compliance is received
with respect to the applicable Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset,
whichever may be applicable, and (y) the Outside Deferred Closing Date, in
each case ((x) and (y)), unless Seller or LBHI shall not have delivered the
joint written instructions required to be delivered to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Deferred Closing Asset Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (c), in the event that, at
the time when any Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration would be released
pursuant to clause (x) above with respect to any Deferred Closing Asset, the
applicable Extension Closings have not previously occurred with respect to all
of the Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets, then the aggregate value of
the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration that shall be released at such time
shall be equal to the excess (if any) of the aggregate value of the Escrowed
Deferred Stock Consideration then being held over the aggregate value of the
Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration allocable to the Deferred Closing Assets
as to which a closing has not then occurred (including the aggregate value of
the portion of the ERPOP Equity Consideration and the AVB Equity Consideration
allocated to the Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets as to which a
closing has not occurred, as set forth on _Schedule 2.5.1)_. Upon any release
of Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration under the circumstances described in
this paragraph, (A) the value of the Escrowed AVB Equity Consideration shall
be based on

 



      
 

 



 

$136.00 per share and the value of the Escrowed ERPOP Equity Consideration
shall be based on $58.75 per share; and (B) the AVB Common Shares and EQR
Common Shares that continue to be held by the Escrow Agent after such release
shall have aggregate values, to the extent possible, in proportion to the
relative aggregate values represented by the EQR Common Shares and the AVB
Common Shares allocable to all Deferred Closing Assets (including any
Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets) as to which an Extension Closing
has not then occurred, as set forth on _Schedule 2.5.1_.

 



 

Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (c), in the event that, at
the time when any Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration would be released
pursuant to clause (y) above, the applicable Extension Closings have not
occurred with respect to all of the Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets,
then the value of the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration that shall be
released at such time shall be equal to the excess (if any) of the aggregate
value of the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration then being held over the
lesser of $50 million and twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate value of the
portion of the ERPOP Equity Consideration and the AVB Equity Consideration
allocated to the Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets as to which a
closing has not occurred, as set forth on _Schedule 2.5.1._ Upon any release
of Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration under the circumstances described in
this paragraph, (I) the value of the Escrowed AVB Equity Consideration shall
be based on $136.00 per share and the value of the Escrowed ERPOP Equity
Consideration shall be based on $58.75 per share; and (II) the shares of
Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration that continue to be held by the Escrow
Agent after such release shall consist, to the extent possible, of AVB Common
Shares and EQR Common Shares representing the same percentages of the portions
of the AVB Equity Consideration and the ERPOP Equity Consideration, as
applicable, allocable to the Montgomery County Deferred Closing Assets as to
which a closing has not then occurred, as set forth on _Schedule 2.5.1_.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 2.5.2(g)_, the Deferred Closing Asset Escrow
Agreement shall provide that, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 10.2_ and _11.2_ , the Parties shall provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed
Deferred Closing Asset Transfer Documents from escrow and deliver the
applicable Escrowed Deferred Closing Asset Transfer Documents to the
applicable Buyer Parties or to Seller on the date referenced in subsection
_(c)_ above (unless the applicable Deferred Closing Asset Consent shall have
been received from the applicable third party but the applicable Buyer Party
shall not have delivered the joint written instructions required to be
delivered by the Deferred Closing Asset Escrow Agreement). Subject to _Section
2.5.2(g)_, without any further action of the parties hereto, on the Outside
Deferred Closing Date, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 10.2_ and _11.2_ , any remaining Escrowed Deferred Stock
Consideration and Escrowed Deferred Closing Asset

 



      
 

 



 

Transfer Documents shall be released from escrow in accordance with the terms
of the Deferred Closing Asset Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(e) From and after the Initial Closing Date, the Buyer Parties shall use their
respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts (but without any payment of money
or other transfer of value to any third party, except as required by the terms
of any applicable Contract relating to such Deferred Closing Asset) to obtain
from the applicable third party (i) the applicable Deferred Closing Asset
Consent for the conveyance, assignment or transfer of the applicable Deferred
Closing Asset to the applicable Buyer Party or Buyer Designee, or (ii) written
confirmation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Lehman and the
Buyer Designees confirming that such Deferred Closing Asset Consent or
approval is not required. Subject to compliance by the Buyer Parties with
_Section 13.10.1(g)_, Seller and the Lehman Entities shall use their
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the Buyer Parties in
obtaining the Deferred Closing Asset Consents and shall take any actions that
can be taken only by the owner of such Deferred Closing Asset (and not by the
Buyer Parties) and which is reasonably requested by the Buyer Parties with
respect to such Deferred Closing Asset Consents within five (5) Business Days
following the receipt of such request from the Buyer Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer Parties acknowledge that Seller and LBHI shall have
limited organization, infrastructure and other resources to provide assistance
to Buyer Parties after the Initial Closing Date.

 



 

(f) The Parties shall enter into, as of the Initial Closing Date, the Deferred
Closing Asset Arrangement Agreement(s).

 



 

(g) In the event that an Asset Transfer Restriction Order is in effect on the
date that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Deferred Closing Asset or a certificate of compliance with respect to the
applicable Tenant Purchase Option Law has not been obtained as of the date
that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset (each such asset, a " _Retained
Deferred Closing Asset_ "), then the Extension Closing with respect to such
Retained Deferred Closing Asset shall be further postponed in accordance with
this _Section 2.5.2(g)_ and the following provisions shall apply:

 



 

(i) The applicable Buyer Party shall deliver to the Seller, LBHI and the
Escrow Agent, on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the date of this
Agreement written certification that an Asset Transfer Restriction Order is in
effect or that a certificate of compliance has not been obtained with respect
to a Montgomery County Deferred Closing Asset and a calculation of the
Retained Escrowed Stock Consideration (such notice, an " _Extension Notice_
").

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) The Deferred Closing Asset Escrow Agreement shall provide that in the
event an Extension Notice has been received by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent shall (X) continue to hold in escrow the Deferred Closing Asset Transfer
Documents related to the Retained Deferred Closing Asset (the " _Retained
Escrowed Documents_ ") and (Y) continue to hold the Retained Escrowed Stock
Consideration, in each case, until the parties provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Retained Escrowed Documents
and the Retained Escrowed Stock Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections
10.2_ and _11.2_ , on the date that is 180 days after the date of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall release all of the Deferred Closing Assets
Transfer Documents and Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration related to all
other Deferred Closing Assets, except those for which an Asset Transfer
Restriction Order is in effect and with respect to any Montgomery County
Deferred Closing Assets as to which a certificate of compliance has not been
obtained. The parties shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent no later than three (3) Business Days from the date on which the
transfer of such Retained Deferred Closing Asset may first be lawfully
consummated or the date on which a certificate of compliance is obtained, as
applicable.

 



 

(h) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that all of the
Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration (other than the Retained Escrowed Stock
Consideration) relating to all the Deferred Closing Assets is not released and
delivered to Seller (or, if so directed by Seller, to LBHI or a Lehman
Designee) on or before the Outside Deferred Closing Date other than as a
result of Sellers failure to deliver the joint instructions required by the
Deferred Closing Asset Escrow Agreement, then Seller, LBHI and any applicable
Lehman Designee shall have all remedies at Law or equity (including the right
to seek specific performance), and other than as set forth in _Section
2.5.2(g)_ for Retained Escrowed Stock Consideration, ERPOP and AVB shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify Seller, LBHI and any Lehman Designees for all
Losses as a result of the failure of the Escrowed Deferred Stock Consideration
to be received by Seller (or, if so directed by Seller, to LBHI or a Lehman
Designee).

 



 

2.6 _Asset Transfer Transactions_.

 



 

2.6.1 _Schedule 2.6_ attached hereto sets forth the steps and conditions
required to cause each Transferred Subsidiary Asset and Transferred Asset to
be transferred to the applicable Buyer Party or Buyer Designee and the
allocable portion of the Cash Purchase Price and the ERPOP Equity
Consideration or the AVB Equity Consideration to be paid in exchange for each
such Transferred Subsidiary Asset. Immediately prior to the Initial Closing
(as described in _Section 2.1.1_), or at any Extension Closing Date (with
respect to any Deferred Closing Asset for which an Extension Closing will
occur), Seller

 



      
 

 



 

shall (and LBHI shall cause Seller and the applicable Archstone Entities to)
take all applicable actions set forth on _Schedule 2.6_ , including the
execution and delivery of all resolutions, bills of sale, deeds, assignments,
and other conveyance documents contemplated by the transactions set forth on
_Schedule 2.6_ , in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the
" _Asset Transfer Documents_ "), _provided_ that the Buyer Parties shall
deliver proposed forms of all such documents a reasonable period in advance of
the Initial Closing and the Asset Transfer Documents shall comply in all
respects with _Section 2.6.3_.

 



 

2.6.2 Subject to _Section 2.6.3_, the Buyer Parties may (subject to the
following conditions) revise _Schedule 2.6_ at any time prior to the Initial
Closing in order to designate other Buyer Designees or to change the steps,
conditions and allocable portion of the Cash Purchase Price and the ERPOP
Equity Consideration or the AVB Equity Consideration to be paid in exchange
for each such Transferred Subsidiary Asset set forth on _Schedule 2.6_ with
respect to any Transferred Subsidiary Asset if such revisions and the Buyer
Parties structure comply in all respects with _Section 2.6.3_; _provided_
that after giving effect to the revisions to _Schedule 2.6_ , the revised
_Schedule 2.6_ is reasonably similar in terms of the types of transactions and
actions required of Seller and the Lehman Entities described therein to the
_Schedule 2.6_ that exists as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

2.6.3 The Buyer Parties shall have the option, in their sole and absolute
discretion, to revise _Schedule 2.6_ to request that Seller, subject to
_Section 13.10.1(e)_ and immediately prior to the Initial Closing, (a)
convert or cause the conversion of one or more Subsidiaries that are organized
as corporations into limited liability companies (or other entities) and one
or more Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships or limited
liability companies into other entities, on the basis of organizational
documents as reasonably requested by the Buyer Parties, (b) revoke or cause to
be revoked the election of one or more Subsidiaries (other than corporations)
that have elected to be treated for Tax purposes as a corporation, (c) sell or
cause to be sold all of the capital stock, shares of beneficial interests,
partnership interests or limited liability interests owned, directly or
indirectly, by Seller in one or more Archstone Entities to any Person (who, if
not an Affiliate of EQR or AVB or an exchange accommodation titleholder, with
respect to any transactions related to any property that the Buyer Parties
desire to be treated as replacement property in an exchange pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Code, shall be reasonably acceptable to LBHI) at a price
and on terms all as designated by the Buyer Parties, or (d) sell or cause to
be sold any of the assets of Seller or any Archstone Entity to any Person at a
price and on terms all as designated by the Buyer Parties (clauses (a), (b),
(c) and (d), together with any other requested revisions to _Schedule 2.6_
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.6.2_, the " _Requested
Transactions_ "); _provided_ that after giving effect to the revisions to
_Schedule 2.6_ , the revised _Schedule 2.6_ is reasonably similar in terms of
the types of transactions and actions required of Seller and the

 



      
 

 



 

Lehman Entities described therein to the _Schedule 2.6_ that exists as of the
date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 2.6_, in no event shall the Asset Transfer Documents or the
Requested Transactions be inconsistent with the following: (i) the Requested
Transactions shall not delay or prevent the completion of the Contemplated
Transactions, (ii) the Requested Transactions shall be implemented as close as
possible to the Initial Closing (but after the Buyer Parties shall have waived
or confirmed in writing that all conditions to the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions have been satisfied) other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Initial Closing, (iii)
neither Seller nor any Lehman Entity or Archstone Entity shall be required to
take any action in contravention of any Law or Organizational Document, or
that imposes any criminal or civil liability, (iv) the consummation of any
Requested Transactions shall be contingent upon the receipt by Seller of an
irrevocable written notice from Buyer Parties confirming that all of the
conditions set forth _Articles 9_ and _10_ have been satisfied (or, with
respect to _Article 10_, at the option of the Buyer Parties, waived) and that
the Buyer Parties are ready, willing and able to, and unconditionally
obligated to, proceed immediately with the Initial Closing, (v) the Requested
Transactions (or the inability to complete the Requested Transactions) and the
Asset Transfer Documents shall not affect or modify in any respect the
obligations of the Buyer Parties under this Agreement, including payment of
the Purchase Price, (vi) the Requested Transactions shall not require Seller
or any Person owning a direct or indirect interest in Seller to be a party to
any Asset Transfer Documents, except, in the case of Seller, with respect to
any asset owned directly by Seller, (vii) the Requested Transactions shall not
create any additional representations, warranties, indemnities, agreements or
other obligations of Seller (except to the extent that such indemnities,
agreements or obligations constitute Assumed Liabilities) or the Lehman
Entities not expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (viii) the Requested
Transactions shall not cause any asset to become more likely to be subject to
a purchase option under any Tenant Purchase Option Law if such asset was not
previously subject to such an option under the terms of _Schedule 2.6_ as of
the date hereof. ERPOP and AVB, on a joint and several basis, shall and do
hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Lehman Entities, and
their Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with or as a result of taking such actions (including
any Liability under any Tax Protection Agreement arising from the Contemplated
Transactions). Without limiting the foregoing, none of the representations,
warranties or covenants of Seller or the Lehman Entities shall be deemed to
apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the Requested
Transactions. ERPOP and AVB, on a joint and several basis, shall and do hereby
agree to indemnify Seller, the Lehman Entities and their Representatives from
and against all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with or as a
result of changes made to _Schedule 2._ 6 after the date hereof (but expressly
excluding any legal fees incurred by such Persons in

 



      
 

 



 

reviewing and commenting on the structure of, or documents implementing, such
asset transfers).

 



 

2.6.4 A Buyer Party or a Buyer Designee may acquire one or more of the
Transferred Assets or Transferred Subsidiary Assets as replacement property in
an exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. Subject to compliance by
the Buyer Parties with _Section 13.10.1(e)_, each Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the other Parties in consummating the transfer of such
Transferred Assets or Transferred Subsidiary Assets in an exchange transaction
pursuant to a written Exchange Agreement and related documents entered into by
the applicable party and a qualified intermediary so long as such cooperation
does not (i) create any additional representations, warranties, indemnities,
agreements or other obligations of Seller (except to the extent that such
indemnities, agreements or obligations constitute Assumed Liabilities) or the
Lehman Entities not expressly set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) require
Seller or any Person owning a direct or indirect interest in Seller to be a
party to any such Exchange Agreement and related documents, except, in the
case of Seller, with respect to any asset owned directly by Seller. ** **Any
assignment of the rights or obligations of a Party hereunder to a qualified
intermediary to effectuate the exchange shall not relieve, release or absolve
such party of its obligations to the other Parties under this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any Lehman Entity shall have any
Liability to any Buyer Indemnified Party if such Person does not achieve its
desired tax treatment under Section 1031 of the Code.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
EFFECT OF SALE**

 



 

3.1 _Required Tax Withholding_. The Buyer Parties shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Purchase Price otherwise payable to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Buyer Parties are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax
Law; _provided_ that the Buyer Parties shall not deduct or withhold any
amounts from the Purchase Price (a) pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code, if
Seller (or any applicable Subsidiary of Seller) has provided either (i) a
certificate of non-foreign status executed by a duly authorized Representative
of Seller or such Subsidiary, sworn under penalty of perjury and in form and
substance required under the Treasury Regulations under Section 1445 of the
Code, to the effect that withholding under Section 1445 of the Code is not
required in connection with the acquisition of the Transferred Assets and
Transferred Subsidiary Assets by the Buyer Parties or Buyer Designees, as
applicable, or (ii) a withholding certificate issued by the IRS pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-3 that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer Parties stating that such amounts are not required to be withheld; ****
or (b) pursuant to any other Law, without having provided to Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary written notice of its intention to withhold and the
basis for such withholding fifteen (15) days prior to the Initial Closing. To
the extent that amounts are withheld by the Buyer Parties or Buyer Designees,
such withheld amounts (x) shall be remitted promptly and in accordance with
applicable Law by the Buyer Parties or Buyer Designees to the applicable
Governmental Authority, and (y) shall be

 



      
 

 



 

treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller or
its applicable Subsidiary in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Buyer Parties or Buyer Designees and shall be deemed part of
the Purchase Price. The Buyer Parties shall promptly provide to Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller or
its applicable Subsidiary of any such remittance.

 



 

3.2 _No Further Ownership Rights_. At and after the Initial Closing (with
respect to all assets other than any Deferred Closing Assets for which an
Extension Closing will occur pursuant to _Section 2.5_) and at and after any
Extension Closing (with respect to the applicable Deferred Closing Asset
subject to such Extension Closing), the Purchase Price, upon payment thereof,
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, shall be deemed to be in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Transferred Assets and
Transferred Subsidiary Assets and no Lehman Entity or Seller shall have any
further ownership or other rights with respect thereto, other than the
performance of the covenants contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents.

of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as presently
conducted. LBHI is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on its ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

4.2 _Authorization; Validity of Agreements_. LBHI has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver (or cause the applicable Lehman Entity to
execute and deliver) this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to
which it or any of the Lehman Entities is a party and to perform its

any other Lehman Entity of any other Transaction Document to which LBHI or any
other Lehman Entity is a party and the performance of LBHIs and the other
Lehman Entities obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly

their parts or on the part of any holders of Equity Interests in them are
necessary in connection with such execution, delivery and performance (other

been duly executed and delivered, or will at the Initial Closing (with respect
to all assets other than any Deferred Closing Assets for which an Extension
Closing will occur pursuant to _Section 2.5_) and at any Extension Closing

legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with
the terms of such Transaction Document, except that (a) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally, and (b) general equitable principles.

performance by LBHI of this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents to

do not and will not (a) violate, contravene or conflict with any provision of
any Organizational Documents of the Lehman Entities or any Organizational
Documents of Seller; (b) except with respect to Consents required under
Contracts set forth in _Schedule 4.3_, result in a breach of or constitute a
default under (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which any Lehman Entity is
a party; (c) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any
Orders or Laws applicable to or binding upon any Lehman Entity; (d) except for

other than Permitted Liens and restrictions on transfer by the applicable
Buyer Party or Buyer Designee imposed under the Organizational Documents of
the Lehman Entities; except, (A) in the case of clauses (c) and (d), for
filings pursuant to the HSR Act or with respect to Transfer Taxes and/or the
payment of such Transfer Taxes and (B) in the case of clauses (b), (c), (d)

4.4.1 The beneficial and record owners of the Equity Interests of Seller are
set forth in _Schedule 4.4.1_. Such Persons have good, valid and marketable
title to, and will, immediately prior to Initial Closing, be the sole
beneficial and record owners of and have good, valid and marketable title to,
all of the Equity Interests of Seller set forth opposite the respective names
of the Lehman Entities in _Schedule 4.4.1_. LBHI has all necessary corporate,
company or other entity power to cause Seller to perform Sellers obligations
under the Transaction Documents. Except for the Equity Interests in Seller and
the voting interests in Archstone Property Holdings LLC (which interests in
Archstone Property Holdings LLC are owned or held by the Lehman Entities set
forth in _Schedule 4.4.1_ ), the Lehman Entities do not directly own or hold
any Equity Interests, voting interests or other interests in any Archstone
Entity.

 



 

4.4.2 Other than pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (a)
each Lehman Entity is not a party to any option, warrant, purchase right or
other

 



      
 

 



 

contract that could require (i) any Archstone Entity to issue any Equity
Interest in such Archstone Entity to any Person other than an Archstone
Entity, or (ii) Seller or any Archstone Entity to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Transferred Assets or Transferred Subsidiary Assets, and (b)
each Lehman Entity is not a party to any voting trust, agreement, proxy or
other Contract with respect to the voting of any Equity Interest in Seller or

Archstone Entity other than the Voting Agreement.

 



 

4.5 _Brokerage Fees_. Except for the Persons set forth in _Schedule 4.5_
(whose fees shall be paid by LBHI pursuant to _Section 13.10.2_), there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary who has been retained
by or is authorized to act on behalf of any Lehman Entity who might be
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

4.6 _Purchase for Investment_.

that term as defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

4.6.2 The ERPOP Equity Consideration and AVB Equity Consideration will be
acquired for investment for each Lehman Designees own account and not with a
view to the distribution of any part thereof in violation of the Securities
Act.

 



 

4.6.3 Each Lehman Designees financial condition is such that it is able to
bear the risk of holding the ERPOP Equity Consideration and AVB Equity
Consideration for an indefinite period of time.

 



 

4.6.4 Each Lehman Designee (either alone or together with its advisors) has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the ERPOP
Equity Consideration and AVB Equity Consideration.

 



 

4.6.5 Each Lehman Designee acknowledges that the ERPOP Equity Consideration
and the AVB Equity Consideration have not been registered under the Securities
Act or under any state or foreign securities laws.

 



 

4.7 _Legal Proceedings; Claims_. No Proceeding is pending nor, to LBHIs
Knowledge, has any Proceeding been threatened in writing against any Lehman
Entity or Seller, which seeks to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge
legality or validity of this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

4.8 _Non-Reliance_. In connection with the due diligence investigation of EQR,
ERPOP and AVB, the Lehman Entities have received and may continue to receive
from EQR, ERPOP and AVB certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information,
regarding EQR, ERPOP and AVB, and their respective business and operations.
LBHI, on behalf of itself and such other Lehman Entity

 



      
 

 



 

and/or other Lehman Designee, hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with
which such Lehman Entity or Lehman Designee is familiar. Other than the
representations and warranties set forth herein, such Lehman Entity or Lehman
Designee acknowledges that (i) neither the Equity Residential Parties nor AVB
make or have made any other representation or warranty, including any
representation or warranty as to the prospects, financial or otherwise, of
ERPOP, EQR or AVB, including with respect to the nature or extent of any of
their Liabilities, the effectiveness or the success of any operations, any
documents, projections, material or other information (financial or otherwise)
regarding EQR, ERPOP and AVB furnished to Lehman Entities or their
Representatives or made available to such Lehman Entities and their
Representatives in any data room, management presentations or in any other
form in expectation of, or in connection with, the Contemplated Transactions,
or in respect of any other matter or thing whatsoever, and (ii) that any
projections, estimates or forecasts of future results or events provided by or
on behalf of EQR, ERPOP and AVB are subject to uncertainty and to the
assumptions used in their preparation. LBHI, on behalf of Seller and the other
Lehman Entities, has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent
investigation of the condition, operations and business of ERPOP, EQR and AVB
and has been provided access to and an opportunity to review any and all
information respecting ERPOP, EQR and AVB requested by LBHI in order for
Seller and the Lehman Entities to make their own determination to proceed with
the Contemplated Transactions.

the consummation by Seller of the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the
Transaction Documents to which Seller is a party has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller, or will at the Initial Closing (with respect to all

than any Deferred Closing Assets for which an Extension Closing will occur
pursuant to _Section 2.5_) and at any Extension Closing (with respect to the
applicable Deferred Closing Asset subject to such Extension Closing), be duly
executed and delivered by Seller, and constitutes, or will constitute at the
Initial Closing (with respect to all assets other than any Deferred Closing
Assets for which an Extension Closing will occur pursuant to _Section 2.5_)
and at any Extension Closing (with respect to the applicable Deferred Closing

except for any notifications required under any Tenant Purchase Option Law,
require on the part of Seller any filing or registration with, notification

Permitted Liens and restrictions on transfer by the Buyer Parties or Buyer
Designees imposed under the Organizational Documents of Seller; and (d)

applicable to or binding upon Seller; except, (A) in the case of clauses (b)
and (d), for filings pursuant to the HSR Act or with respect to Transfer Taxes
and/or the payment of any such Transfer Taxes, and (B) in the case of clauses

and record owner and has good, valid and marketable title to, and will,
immediately prior to the Initial Closing, be the sole beneficial and record
owner and have good, valid and marketable title to, all of the Primary
Archstone Entities, free and clear of all Liens (other than any restrictions
on transfer by any applicable Buyer Party or Buyer Designee imposed under
applicable securities Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Archstone

is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

6.1.2 To Sellers Knowledge and LBHIs Knowledge, each Primary Archstone
Entity has all requisite entity power and authority necessary to own, lease

Archstone Entities, neither the Primary Archstone Entities nor, to Sellers
Knowledge and LBHIs Knowledge, any of their Subsidiaries or any Non-
Controlled Subsidiaries have (i) granted any options, warrants, rights or
other securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Equity
Interests and/or voting interests of a Subsidiary or Non-Controlled
Subsidiary, or (ii) entered into any Contracts (x) relating to the redemption,

7.6 _Purchase for Investment_.

 



 

7.6.1 ERPOP is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of that term as
defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

7.6.2 The Transferred Interests will be acquired for investment for ERPOPs
own account and not with a view to the distribution of any part thereof in
violation of the Securities Act.

 



 

7.6.3 ERPOPs financial condition is such that it is able to bear the risk of
holding the Transferred Interests for an indefinite period of time.

 



       
 

 



 

7.6.4 ERPOP (either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Transferred
Interests.

 



 

7.6.5 ERPOP acknowledges that the Transferred Interests and the Equity
Interests in the Archstone Entities have not been registered under the
Securities Act or under any state or foreign securities laws.

 



 

7.7 _Financing_.

 



 

7.7.1 ERPOP will have, at or prior to the Initial Closing, sufficient liquid
funds (through cash on hand, credit arrangements or otherwise) to (a) pay all
amounts payable in cash by ERPOP at the Initial Closing hereunder, and (b)
make all other necessary payments of fees and expenses payable by ERPOP at the
Initial Closing in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

7.7.2 ERPOP has provided to Seller a true, complete and correct copy of an
executed commitment letter (the " _ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. (together with its successors and assigns
under the ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter, the " _ERPOP Lenders_ ") pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the ERPOP Lenders have
committed to provide ERPOP with financing in an aggregate amount of
$2,500,000,000 (the " _ERPOP Debt Financing_ "). The ERPOP Debt Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the ERPOP and, to the
knowledge of ERPOP, each of the other parties thereto. The ERPOP Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement, and as of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in
the ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date hereof, the ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is valid and, to ERPOPs actual knowledge, is enforceable
against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. Except for the
payment of customary fees, there are no conditions precedent, side agreements
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the ERPOP
Debt Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the ERPOP Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of ERPOP, and to the knowledge of ERPOP, any other parties thereto,
under the ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, and assuming
the conditions set forth in _Section 10.1_ hereof are satisfied, ERPOP
reasonably believes that it will be able to satisfy the material conditions to
the ERPOP Debt Financing contemplated by the ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter and
that the ERPOP Debt Financing will be made available to ERPOP on the Initial
Closing Date. ERPOP will provide to Seller any amendments to the ERPOP Debt
Commitment Letter, or any written notices given pursuant thereto, as promptly
as possible. ERPOP has fully paid or caused to be fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees that are payable by it or EQR under the

 



      
 

 



 

ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto on or prior
to the date hereof and has otherwise satisfied all other terms and conditions
under the ERPOP Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it or EQR
on or prior to the date hereof.

 



 

7.7.3 ERPOP expressly acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are not
subject to any conditions, express or implied, regarding ERPOPs ability to
obtain financing (or to obtain financing on terms acceptable to ERPOP) for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

7.8 _Valid Issuance of Shares_. EQR has, and shall have at the Initial
Closing, a sufficient number of EQR Common Shares authorized but unissued for
the purpose of contributing the ERPOP Equity Consideration to ERPOP so that
ERPOP may deliver the ERPOP Equity Consideration to Seller (or, if so directed
by Seller, to LBHI and/or any Lehman Designee) at the Initial Closing and any
Extension Closing (in each case after giving effect to all anti-dilution
adjustments). All EQR Common Shares that will be delivered as the ERPOP
Equity Consideration to Seller (or, if so directed by Seller, to LBHI and/or
any Lehman Designee) shall have been duly authorized and validly issued and,
upon delivery to ERPOP or the applicable Buyer Designees of the Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets to be acquired by them, shall be
fully paid and non-assessable, and shall be free from preemptive rights and
free of any Liens or restrictions on transfer other than restrictions under
the Transaction Documents, under EQRs Organizational Documents and under
applicable state and federal securities Laws. No vote of the holders of the
EQR Shares or the board of trustees of EQR is necessary to approve the
issuance of the EQR Common Shares for the payment of the ERPOP Equity
Consideration or the entry into the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

7.9 _Brokerage Fees_. Other than Morgan Stanley, whose fees will be paid by
ERPOP, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary who
has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of any Equity
Residential Party who might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

7.10 _Non-Reliance_. In connection with the due diligence investigation of
Seller and the Archstone Entities by the Equity Residential Parties, the
Equity Residential Parties have received and may continue to receive from the
Lehman Entities and Seller certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information,
regarding the Archstone Entities, their business and operations, the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets. The Equity
Residential Parties hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which the
Equity Residential Parties are familiar. Other than the representations and
warranties set forth herein, the Equity Residential Parties acknowledge that
(i) the Lehman Entities and Seller make and have made no representation or
warranty, including any representation or warranty as to the prospects,
financial or otherwise, of the Archstone Entities, including with respect to
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any assets, the
nature or extent of any Liabilities, the effectiveness or the success of any
operations, or the accuracy or completeness of any registration statement
filed prior to the date hereof, any confidential information memoranda,
documents, projections, material or other information

 



      
 

 



 

(financial or otherwise) regarding the Archstone Entities, the Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets furnished to the Equity
Residential Parties or their Representatives or made available to such Equity
Residential Party and its Representatives in any Data Room, management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the Contemplated Transactions, or in respect of any other matter or thing
whatsoever, and (ii) that any projections, estimates or forecasts of future
results or events provided by or on behalf of the Lehman Entities and Seller
are subject to uncertainty and to the assumptions used in their preparation.
The Equity Residential Parties acknowledge that the Equity Residential Parties
are acquiring the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets on
an "AS IS, WHERE IS" basis, "with all faults," subject only to (x) the
specific representations and warranties set forth in _Articles 4_ , _5_ and
_6_ , which representations and warranties shall survive the Initial Closing
in accordance with _Section 14.1_ , and (y) the indemnification obligations
set forth in _Article 14_ hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither Seller nor LBHI are making any representations or warranties
with respect to any (x) consent or approval that may be required to be
obtained from any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) in connection
with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions or with respect to any
Lien that may be imposed on any asset of Seller or the Archstone Entities as a
result of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, and (y) any Tenant Purchase Option Laws. The lack of any other
representations and warranties relating to the Archstone Entities, Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets was specifically bargained-for
among the Equity Residential Parties, Seller and the Lehman Entities and was
taken into account by the Equity Residential Parties, Seller and the Lehman
Entities in arriving at the Purchase Price. The Equity Residential Parties
have conducted, to their satisfaction, their own independent investigation of
the condition, operations and business of the Archstone Entities, Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets and the Equity Residential
Parties have been provided access to and an opportunity to review any and all
information respecting the Archstone Entities, Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Subsidiary Assets requested by the Equity Residential Parties in
order for the Equity Residential Parties to make their own determination to
proceed with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

7.11 _Solvency_. Each of the Equity Residential Parties is solvent for all
purposes under federal bankruptcy and applicable state fraudulent transfer and
fraudulent conveyance Laws. The Contemplated Transactions will not render the
Equity Residential Parties insolvent for such purposes and do not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance under such Laws.

committed to provide AVB with financing in an aggregate amount of up to

the knowledge of AVB, each of the other parties thereto. The AVB Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement, and as of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in
the AVB Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any

Closing, a sufficient number of AVB Common Shares authorized but unissued for
the purpose of issuing the AVB Equity Consideration to Seller (or, if so
directed by Seller, to LBHI and/or any Lehman Designee) at the Initial Closing
and any Extension Closing (in each case after giving effect to all anti-
dilution adjustments). All AVB Common Shares that will be delivered as AVB
Equity Consideration to Seller (or, if so directed by Seller, to LBHI and/or
any Lehman Designee) shall have been duly authorized and validly issued and,
upon delivery to AVB or the applicable Buyer Designees of the Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets to be acquired by them, shall be
fully paid and non-assessable, and shall be free from preemptive rights and
free of any Liens or restrictions on transfer other than restrictions under

Consideration or the entry into the Contemplated Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

8.9 _Brokerage Fees_. Other than Greenhill and Goldman Sachs, whose fees will
be paid by **** AVB, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary who has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of AVB

Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

8.10 _Non-Reliance_. In connection with the due diligence investigation of
Seller and the Archstone Entities by AVB, AVB has received and may continue to
receive from the Lehman Entities and Seller certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business
plan information, regarding the Archstone Entities, their business and
operations, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets. AVB
hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
statements, as well as in such business plans, with which AVB is familiar.
Other than the representations and warranties set forth herein, **** AVB
acknowledges that (i) the Lehman Entities and Seller make and have made no
representation or warranty, including any representation or warranty as to the
prospects, financial or otherwise, of the Archstone Entities, including with
respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any
assets, the nature or extent of any Liabilities, the effectiveness or the
success of any operations, or the accuracy or completeness of any registration
statement filed prior to the date hereof, any confidential information
memoranda, documents, projections, material or other information (financial or
otherwise) regarding the Archstone Entities, the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Subsidiary Assets furnished to AVB or its Representatives or made
available to AVB and its Representatives in any Data Room, management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the Contemplated Transactions, or in respect of any other matter or thing
whatsoever, and (ii) that any projections, estimates or forecasts of future
results or events provided by or on behalf of the Lehman Entities and Seller
are subject to uncertainty and to the assumptions used in their preparation.
AVB acknowledges that AVB is acquiring the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Subsidiary Assets on an "AS IS, WHERE IS" basis, "with all
faults," subject only to (x) the specific representations and warranties set
forth in _Articles 4_ , _5_ and _6_ , which representations and warranties
shall survive the Initial Closing in accordance with _Section 14.1,_ and (y)
the indemnification obligations set forth in _Article 14_ hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Seller nor LBHI are
making any representations or warranties with respect to (x) any consent or
approval that may be required to be obtained from any Person (other than a
Governmental Authority) in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions or with respect to any Lien that may be imposed on any asset of
Seller or the Archstone Entities as a result of, or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, and (y) any Tenant Purchase Option
Laws. The lack of any other representations and warranties relating to the
Archstone Entities, Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets
was specifically bargained-for among AVB, Seller and the Lehman Entities and
was taken into account by AVB, Seller and the Lehman Entities in arriving at
the Purchase Price. AVB has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own
independent investigation of the condition, operations and business of the
Archstone Entities, Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets
and AVB has been provided access to and an opportunity to review any and all
information respecting the Archstone Entities, Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Subsidiary Assets requested by AVB in order for AVB to make its
own determination to proceed with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

8.11 _Solvency_. AVB is solvent for all purposes under federal bankruptcy and
applicable state fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance Laws. The
Contemplated Transactions will not render AVB insolvent for such purposes and
do not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under such Laws.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9 
CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTYS OBLIGATION TO CLOSE**

 



 

The respective obligations of each of the Parties to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions at the Initial Closing or any Extension Closing are
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver in writing by each Party, in their respective sole and absolute
discretion, at or prior to the Initial Closing or any Extension Closing, as
applicable, of each of the following conditions set forth in this _Article
9_.

 



 

9.1 _Competition Matters_. Any applicable waiting period (and any extension
thereof) under any Antitrust Law relating to the Contemplated Transactions
shall have expired or been terminated and any necessary approvals under any
Antitrust Law shall have been obtained.

 



 

9.2 _No Injunction or Illegality_. There must not be in effect any Order or
Orders, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, issued by any
Governmental Authority restraining, enjoining, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of (a) with respect to the Initial Closing, a Substantial Portion
of the Contemplated Transactions, and (b) with respect to any Extension
Closing, the Deferred Closing Assets subject to such Extension Closing. There
must not be (i) with respect to the Initial Closing, any Law in effect that
makes the consummation of a Substantial Portion of the Contemplated
Transactions illegal or (ii) with respect to any Extension Closing, any Law in
effect that makes the consummation of the transfer of the applicable Deferred
Closing Assets in accordance with _Section 2.6_ illegal. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, to the extent that (x) any Order or Orders whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, issued by any Governmental Authority
exists as of the Initial Closing restraining, enjoining, preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions
(including the transfer of any assets to the Buyer Parties in accordance with
_Schedule 2.6_ ), but such Orders do not, in the aggregate, apply to a
Substantial Portion of the Contemplated Transactions, or (y) as of the Initial
Closing, any Law in effect that makes the consummation of any of the
Contemplated Transactions (including the transfer of any assets to the Buyer
Parties in accordance with _Schedule 2.6_ ) illegal, but does not make a
Substantial Portion of the Contemplated Transactions illegal, then, in each
case ((x) and (y)) the assets subject to any such illegal, prohibited,
restrained, prevented or enjoined Contemplated Transaction shall be treated as
"Deferred Closing Assets" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be subject
to the obligations and procedures set forth in _Section 2.5_ (except that the
"Outside Deferred Closing Date" with respect to any such assets shall be the
date that is three (3) Business Days after the date on which such Contemplated
Transactions may first be lawfully consummated and except to the extent
otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties).

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10 
CONDITIONS TO THE BUYER PARTIES OBLIGATION TO CLOSE**

 



 

10.1 _Conditions to the Initial Closing_. The Buyer Parties obligation to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions at the Initial Closing and to take
the other actions contemplated by this Agreement at the Initial Closing are
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver in writing by the Buyer Parties, in their sole and absolute discretion,
at or prior to the Initial Closing, of each of the following conditions set
forth in this _Section 10.1_.

 



 

10.1.1 _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Seller Fundamental Representations shall be true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Initial Closing Date as if made
at and as of such date (unless such representations were expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case such representations shall be true and correct
on and as of such earlier date), except for any inaccuracies of the Seller
Fundamental Representations that would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in Losses in excess of $10,000,000
(it being acknowledged and agreed that, if the Initial Closing occurs, any
such Losses (whether or not in excess of such amount), if actually incurred,
would be recoverable by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with the
terms of _Article 14_ regardless of whether such Losses were known or
disclosed prior to the Initial Closing); _provided_ _however_ , that (i) if
the condition set forth in this _Section 10.1.1(a)_ would not be satisfied as
a result of Losses in excess of $10,000,000, but less than $250,000,000
(considered together with the cumulative amount of Losses resulting from the
failure of the conditions in _Sections 10.1.2_ , _10.1.4_ and _10.1.6_ to be
satisfied), and (ii) the amount of Losses constitute Quantified Losses, then,

Party may increase the AVB Cash Purchase Price Portion or EQR Cash Purchase
Price Portion, as applicable, in the amount of all such Losses and the
condition set forth in this _Section 11.1.2_ shall be deemed to be satisfied

(a) If any Proceeding has been initiated regarding the exemption of the

Option Laws prior to or after the Initial Closing, then at any time following
the initiation of such Proceeding and within a reasonable time following the
reasonable request of the Buyer Parties, LBHI shall file a motion or motions
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer Parties and LBHI,
requesting such court to enter an Order as to the following matters: (x) the
Contemplated Transactions are being effected pursuant to the Modified Third
Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its
Affiliated Debtors, dated December 6, 2011 and that certain Order Confirming
Modified Third Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and its Affiliated Debtors, dated December 6, 2011, [Docket No. 23023] and (y)
the Contemplated Transactions are, therefore, exempt from any Transfer Taxes
by reason of Section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and qualify for exemptions
under the applicable Tenant Purchase Option Law, as the case may be.

 



 

(b) If any Proceeding has been initiated regarding the exemption of the
Contemplated Transactions from Transfer Taxes or the requirements of any
Tenant Purchase Option Laws prior to or after the Initial Closing, then at any
time following the initiation of such Proceeding and within a reasonable time
following the reasonable request of the Buyer Parties, LBHI shall and shall
cause Seller or any applicable Archstone Entity to, file such motions,
complaints, or other pleadings or take such other actions reasonably requested

Transfer Tax or Tenant Purchase Option Laws as are necessary (i) to request
that such court or other tribunal enter an Order (x) directing the parties to
litigate the dispute in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York, or (y) to the effect that the Contemplated Transactions
are exempt from any requirement to pay Transfer Taxes and any Tenant Purchase
Option Law, as applicable, and/or (ii) to request such other relief,
including, to the extent necessary, enabling LBHI, Seller or their Affiliates,
as the case may be, to join such proceedings as a party or intervenor, as is
necessary to obtain a determination that the Contemplated Transactions are
exempt from the requirement to pay any Transfer Taxes. In addition, upon the
request of the Buyer Parties, LBHI and Seller shall participate in the
resolution of any controversy with a Governmental Authority or otherwise
regarding the applicability of the exemption of any of the Contemplated
Transactions from Transfer Tax or Tenant Purchase Option Laws.

 



 

(c) LBHI shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to secure a favorable
ruling in any proceeding described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section
13.1.5_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Lehman Entities or Seller
has made any representation, warranty or guaranty with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

the outcome of any such Proceeding and in no event will any Lehman Entity or
Seller have any obligation or Liability with respect to the outcome of such
Proceeding.

 



 

(d) Upon the request of the Buyer Parties, subject to Sellers and LBHIs
review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld), LBHI and Seller shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, execute and deliver to the Buyer Parties
transfer tax returns (signed and sworn), prepared substantially in accordance
with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law, as the Buyer
Parties or the Buyer Designees may reasonably require at or after the Initial

underlying calculations, allocations and methodologies related to compliance
therewith), requested by the Buyer Parties (and Seller and LBHI shall not, and
shall cause the Archstone Entities not to, assert any privilege as grounds for

and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions contained therein, (b) satisfy on a timely basis all terms,
covenants and conditions applicable to such Buyer Party in such definitive
agreements, and (c) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Initial
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Buyer Party has raised
through alternative sources sufficient funds to meet its obligations to pay
its portion of the Cash Purchase Price and any costs or expenses incurred by
such Buyer Party in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions without any proceeds under such Debt Financing, such Buyer Party
shall have no obligation to arrange Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in its respective Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise. In the event
any portion of the Debt Financing of either Buyer Party becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the applicable Debt Commitment
Letter, and to the extent such Buyer Party will not have sufficient funds to
meet its obligations to pay its portion of the Cash Purchase Price without
some or all of the proceeds under such Debt Financing, such Buyer Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from
alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to such Buyer Party
(as determined in the reasonable judgment of such Buyer Party) as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Each Buyer Party will
furnish correct and complete copies of all definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing to Seller promptly upon their execution. No Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Party shall amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Debt Commitment
Letters in any manner that would prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions without the prior written
consent of Seller.

 



 

13.13.2 Each Buyer Party shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange its
respective Debt Financing, and shall not permit any material amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy
under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment would or would be
reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in any
material respect such Buyer Partys ability to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, without first obtaining Sellers prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

13.13.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer
Parties acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are not
conditioned in any manner upon their obtaining any financing, and the
existence of any conditions contained in their respective Debt Commitment
Letters shall not constitute, or be construed to constitute, a condition to
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit in any manner the ability of the any Party
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article 15_ and the sole
remedy for any such termination shall be as described in _Section 15.3_.

 



 

13.13.4 Seller agrees to provide, and shall cause the Archstone Entities and
its and their Representatives to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing and
any debt, equity or other offering or source of financing by AVB, ERPOP or EQR
prior to the Initial Closing as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer
Parties ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Business of the Archstone
Entities), including (a) participation in meetings with potential lenders and
underwriters, upon reasonable prior notice by the Buyer Parties, (b)
furnishing Buyer Parties with pertinent information available to the Archstone
Entities and their Representatives regarding the Archstone Entities and the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary Assets, subject to the terms
and conditions of the applicable confidentiality agreements, (c) assist the
Buyer Parties, to the extent reasonably necessary, in obtaining customary
accountants comfort letters and consents from the Archstone accountants, and
(d) assist with the preparation of customary materials in connection with the
Debt Financing or any such other debt, equity or other offering or source of
financing by AVB or ERPOP to the extent such documents described in this
clause (d) contain disclosure reflecting or referring to any of the Archstone
Entities or Joint Ventures; _provided_ , that performance of Sellers
obligations pursuant to this _Section 13.13.4_ shall not cause Seller to incur
any unreimbursed Liability.

 



   

     
 

 



 

13.14 _Representative Indemnification_.

 



 

13.14.1 From and after the Initial Closing, the Buyer Parties shall, and shall
cause the Archstone Entities to, honor and perform all obligations of the
Archstone Entities to any individual who at the Initial Closing Date is, or at
any time prior to the Initial Closing Date was, a Representative of Seller or
any Archstone Entity (each, an " _Archstone Indemnitee_ ") with respect to all
rights to indemnification and exculpation (including the advancement of
expenses) from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Initial Closing Date as provided in (a) the Organizational Documents of the
Archstone Entities (as in effect on the date hereof), and (b) any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of any Archstone Entity with
respect to the Archstone Indemnitees existing on the date hereof, which shall
survive the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer Parties and Archstone Entities shall not be
required to indemnify the Archstone Indemnitees for claims related to the
matters set forth in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and
_14.2.2(f)_ to the extent that LBHI is responsible for indemnifying the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to such sections.

 



 

13.14.2 The provisions of this _Section 13.14_ are (a) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Archstone Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives, and (b) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Buyer
Parties and the Archstone Entities under this _Section 13.14_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Archstone Indemnitee to whom this _Section 13.14_ applies unless (i) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected
Archstone Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being agreed by the Parties that the Archstone Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 13.14_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 13.14_).

 



 

13.14.3 In the event that any of the Buyer Parties or the Buyer Designees, any
Archstone Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of any such Buyer Party or Buyer Designee, Archstone Entity or their
respective successors or assigns, as applicable, shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 13.14_.

 



 

13.14.4 The Buyer Parties shall and do hereby, jointly and severally,
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties against, and hold them harmless, from
any and all

 



      
 

 



 

Losses arising out of, resulting from or related to any breach of this
_Section 13.14_.

 



 

13.14.5 The Buyer Parties further agree that with respect to any Archstone
Indemnitee who is employed, retained or otherwise associated with, or
appointed or nominated by, LBHI or any of its Affiliates and who acts or
serves as a director, officer, manager, fiduciary, employee, consultant,
advisor or agent of, for or to Seller or any Archstone Entity, that the
Archstone Entities shall be primarily liable for all indemnification,
reimbursements, advancements or similar payments (the " _Indemnity
Obligations_ ") afforded to such Archstone Indemnitee acting in such capacity
or capacities on behalf or at the request of LBHI or any of its Affiliates,
whether the Indemnity Obligations are created by Law, organizational or
constituent documents (as in effect on the date hereof), contract or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the fact that LBHI or any of its Affiliates may
have concurrent Liability to an Archstone Indemnitee with respect to the
Indemnity Obligations, the Buyer Parties hereby agree that in no event shall
Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates have any right or claim against LBHI
or any of its Affiliates for contribution or have rights of subrogation
against LBHI or any of its Affiliates through an Archstone Indemnitee for any
payment made by the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates with respect to
any Indemnity Obligation. In addition, the Buyer Parties hereby agree that in
the event that LBHI or any of its Affiliates (including Seller) pay or advance
an Archstone Indemnitee any amount with respect to an Indemnity Obligation,
the Buyer Parties will promptly reimburse LBHI or its Affiliate for such
payment or advance upon request. None of the foregoing provisions shall be
deemed to require the Buyer Parties and Archstone Entities to indemnify the
Archstone Indemnitees for claims related to the matters set forth in _Sections
14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ to the extent that
LBHI is responsible for indemnifying the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
such sections.

 



 

13.15 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

13.15.1 Each employee of the Archstone Entities (other than any such employees
who are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements) who remains an
employee of the Archstone Entities or their successors or assigns
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") will be credited with his or
her years of service with the Archstone Entities (and any predecessor entities
thereof) before the Closing Date under any employee benefit plan of the Buyer
Parties in which the Continuing Employee becomes entitled to participate to
the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Initial Closing
Date, to credit for such service under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan
(except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits
and except with respect to benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan).

 



 

13.15.2 The provisions of this _Section 13.15_ shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 13.15_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 13.15_.

 



 

13.15.3 At the Initial Closing, the individuals set forth on _Schedule
13.15.3_ shall be terminated and upon the execution of a release in accordance
with each such individuals agreement with the applicable Archstone Entity,
each such individual shall be paid the amounts payable pursuant to such
individuals agreement.

 



 

13.15.4 Upon the written request of the Buyer Parties, Seller shall, and shall
cause the applicable Archstone Entities to, provide thirty (30) days prior
written notice of the termination of employment of each employee of any
Archstone Entity that is a party to a change-in-control agreement; _provided_
, _however,_ that such notice shall be conditional on the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

13.15.5 The Parties acknowledge that (i) the Contemplated Transactions will
constitute a change in control under the Contracts set forth in _Schedule
6.10_ , and (ii) in exchange for the senior executives set forth on _Schedule
13.15.5_ agreeing to remain employed by the Archstone Entities for up to 90
days after the Initial Closing Date upon the request of a Buyer Party, the
Buyer Parties agree that (x) any termination of the employment of any such
senior executive after such period shall constitute a termination for "good
reason", which shall not be subject to cure by the Buyer Parties and as to
which any 30-day prior notice shall be waived, (y) any such termination for
"good reason" shall entitle such senior executive to collect severance
payments and benefits pursuant to such senior executives applicable
employment or change-of-control agreement, and (z) on the Initial Closing
Date, the Buyer Parties shall deposit the amounts payable to such senior
executives set forth on _Schedule 13.15.5_ who shall have been requested to
remain employed following the Initial Closing Date in accordance with the
Contracts set forth in _Schedule 6.10_ into an escrow account with a third
party escrow agent mutually agreed upon by Seller and the Buyer Parties and
such amounts payable shall be released from escrow to the applicable senior
executives upon the written instructions of both of the Buyer Parties,
provided that all such amounts deposited in such escrow account shall be
subject to the general creditors of the Buyer Parties.

 



 

13.15.6 To the extent timely requested by the Buyer Parties or as required by
applicable Law, Seller and LBHI shall, or shall cause the applicable Archstone
Entities to, make any filings and shall deliver any notices prepared by the
Buyer Parties (with assistance of Seller and LBHI) with respect to any
employees of the Archstone Entities that are required to be delivered under
WARN or any similar applicable Law in any jurisdiction so that neither the
Buyer Parties, the Archstone Entities nor their respective Affiliates shall
have any liability under WARN or any similar applicable Law in any
jurisdiction with respect to any employees for which the Buyer Parties had
requested that such WARN filings or notices be made.

 



      
 

 



 

13.16 _Mutual Release_. At the Initial Closing, the Archstone Entities, on the
one hand, and LBHI, LCPI and Seller, on the other hand, shall execute a mutual
release in substantially the form set forth on _Exhibit F_, and the Buyer
Parties shall acknowledge the release as set forth therein. In addition, each
of Seller and LBHI (on behalf of itself and each of the Lehman Entities)
hereby waives any and all option and preemption rights that it may have
pursuant to the Management Regulations, Luxembourg law or other similar Laws
to acquire any assets of the Archstone Entities or the Joint Ventures.

 



 

13.17 _Certain Intellectual Property Matters_.

 



 

13.17.1 It is acknowledged and agreed that the Buyer Parties are obtaining as
Transferred Assets all of LBHIs and Sellers right, title and interest in and
to and licenses to use the name "Archstone" and any trademarks, logos, trade
names or other Intellectual Property rights owned by Seller, LBHI or any other
Persons controlled by LBHI and exclusively used in the Business.

 



 

13.17.2 From and after the Initial Closing, neither Seller nor any other
Person controlled by LBHI shall, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, use
any trademark, logo or trade name exclusively used in the Business or by the
Archstone Entities or any of their respective Affiliates, or any trademarks,
logos or trade names that are confusingly similar thereto or that, to Sellers
Knowledge and LBHIs Knowledge, are a translation or transliteration thereof.

 



 

13.17.3 Without limiting the provisions of _Section 13.17.1_, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Initial Closing, but not later than
thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall, and LBHI shall
cause Seller and each other Person controlled by LBHI to, take any and all
actions as reasonably necessary, including making filings with appropriate
Governmental Authorities, to change the name of Seller to remove "Archstone"
therefrom.

 



 

13.17.4 Without limiting the provisions of _Section 13.17.2_ as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Initial Closing, but not later than
thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall, and LBHI shall
cause Seller and each other Person controlled by LBHI to, use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to destroy, remove, cause to be removed, or change signage,
promotional or advertising material in whatever medium, and stationery and
packaging, and take all such other steps as may be required or reasonably
appropriate to cease use of all trademarks, logos or trade names owned by the
Buyer Parties or the Archstone Entities or otherwise constituting a
Transferred Asset.

 



 

13.18 _Hedging Arrangements_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Initial Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article 15, Seller and LBHI shall not, and Seller and LBHI shall cause
the Archstone Entities, the Lehman Entities and its other subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, enter into any swap or any other agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

transaction or series of transactions that hedges or transfers, in whole or in
part, the economic consequence of ownership of any capital stock of EQR or AVB
or any interest therein, whether any such swap, agreement, transaction or
series of transactions is to be settled by delivery of securities, in cash or
otherwise, including any hedging arrangement or transfer based on the FTSE
NAREIT All Residential Capped Index, the FTSE NAREIT Equity Residential Index,
the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index or any other index of which the
capital stock of either of EQR or AVB represents at least 5% of the value at
the time such hedging arrangement or transfer is entered into.

 



 

13.19 _Certain Germany Arrangements_. Promptly following a request from the
Buyer Parties, Seller and LBHI shall, and shall cause the applicable Archstone
Entities to, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take all actions necessary
to terminate and rescind the contemplated equity investment by any Archstone
Entity and any other Person with respect to potential investments in each of
the international funds or sub-funds formed pursuant to German, Netherlands or
Luxembourg law and relating to the potential investment in assets in Germany

Archstone Management Germany II LLC would indirectly have an interest),
including by (i) terminating and rescinding all sale and purchase agreements,
including with respect to the Dali asset portfolio, (ii) not approving the
subscription agreements or other capital commitments related to such potential

Representations) or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement
relating to the representations and warranties (other than the Seller

the Initial Closing in accordance with their terms. All claims related to the
matters described in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ through _14.2.2(i)_ shall survive
with respect to claims as to which a Claim Notice has been delivered on or
before the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Initial Closing. It is understood
and agreed that (a) after the Initial Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any breach of this Agreement shall be a claim for Losses made
pursuant to (and subject to the limitations of) this _Article 14_; _provided_
that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the
right of any Buyer Party (i) to pursue an action for or to seek remedies with
respect to claims for fraud, or (ii) Seller, or LBHI to seek specific
performance or other equitable relief in accordance with _Section 15.4_; and
(b) before the Initial Closing, the Parties shall be entitled only to the
termination and other remedies set forth in _Article 15_, and indemnification
under this _Article 14_ shall not apply.

 



      
 

 



 

14.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

14.2.1 Effective as of the Initial Closing and subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article 14_, the Buyer Parties shall and do hereby, jointly
and severally, indemnify the Lehman Entities, Seller, their respective
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (together, in each case, with
their respective successors and permitted assigns, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ") against, and hold them harmless from, any and all Losses arising
out of, resulting from or related to:

 



 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any Buyer Party Fundamental Representation
made in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement relating to such Buyer Party Fundamental Representations;

(f) any Liabilities relating to a breach by the Archstone Entities of their
obligations under the Indemnity Agreement from and after the Initial Closing,
except for any such Liabilities described in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ ,
_14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ to the extent that LBHI is
responsible for indemnifying the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to such
sections.

 



 

14.2.2 Effective as of the Initial Closing and subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article 14_, LBHI shall indemnify the Buyer Parties, their
respective Affiliates (including the Archstone Entities), and their respective
Representatives (together, in each case, with their respective successors and

harmless from, any and all Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party or

the extent arising out of, resulting from or related to:

(iii) the Losses (including legal fees and expenses) described in _Section
14.4_; _provided_ , however, that for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of
this _Section 14.2.2(d)_, with respect to any current holder of Preferred

(B) the liquidation preference of any such Preferred Units held by such holder
of such Preferred Units immediately following resolution of any applicable

after the Initial Closing of an obligation of the Archstone Entities.

 



 

14.2.3 For any matters that are indemnifiable by any Indemnifying Party under
_Section 14.2.1_ or _Section 14.2.2_, (a) if any Losses with respect to such
matters are out-of-pocket Losses, then such Losses shall not be payable to the
Indemnified Party until such expense has actually been incurred and an invoice
related thereto has been submitted for payment, or (b) if any Losses relate to
the settlement of any claim or judgment, then such Losses shall not be payable
to the Indemnified Party until the earliest of (i) the time when such
settlement amount or judgment-related amount has actually been paid, (ii) with
respect to any judgment, when the judgment has become final and non-
appealable, and (iii) when a surety bond in respect thereof is required to be
posted.

 



 

14.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

14.3.1 If any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as the case
may be, seeks to make a claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnified Claim_ ")
pursuant to _Section 14.2.1_ or _Section 14.2.2_, as applicable, other than
in respect of a Third Party Claim, the Party entitled to indemnification (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall notify the party required to provide indemnity
hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such claim specifying
in reasonable detail the factual basis of such claim, stating the amount of
Losses (or if not known, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses) and
the method of computation thereof, containing a reference to any and all
provisions of this Agreement with respect to which indemnification is being
sought (each such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ "). The failure by any
Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement which it may have to
such Indemnified Party under _Section 14.2_ hereof except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced with respect to such individual
indemnified claim in any material respect as a result of such failure. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall endeavor to negotiate in
good faith a resolution of any dispute described in a Claim Notice and, if not
resolved through negotiations within sixty (60) days after the delivery of the
Claim Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation as provided in
_Section 16.5_.

 



 

14.3.2 In the event that any claim is asserted in writing by any Person other
than a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party or any Proceeding
is commenced or threatened in writing by any Person other than a Buyer
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party involving a claim for which

 



      
 

 



 

an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) after
the Indemnified Party receives written notification of the facts giving rise
to such Third Party Claim, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis
of the Third Party Claim, stating the amount of Losses (or if not known, a
good faith estimate of the amount of Losses) and the method of computation
thereof, containing a reference to any and all provisions of this Agreement
with respect to which indemnification is being sought. The failure of an
Indemnified Party to provide notice in accordance with this _Section 14.3.2_,
or any delay in providing such notice, shall not constitute a waiver of that
Indemnified Partys claims to indemnification pursuant to _Section 14.2_,
except to the extent that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have been
prejudiced in any material respect as a result of such failure, or (ii) such
notice is not delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 14.1_. Any such notice
to the Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim shall be accompanied by a
copy of any papers theretofore served on or delivered to the Indemnified Party
in connection with such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(a) In the event of receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 14.3.2, the Indemnifying Party will
be entitled to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim
subject to the provisions of this Section 14.3.2, and the Indemnified Party
shall be permitted to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own expense (except as
otherwise provided in the last sentence of this Section 14.3.2). After written
notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to
assume the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal fees or expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party for its own account. Whether
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party is defending and controlling
any such Third Party Claim, it shall select counsel, contractors, experts and
consultants of recognized standing and competence, shall take reasonable steps
necessary in the investigation, defense or settlement thereof, and shall
diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. The party conducting
the defense thereof shall at all times act as if all Losses relating to the
Third Party Claim were for its own account and shall act in good faith and
with reasonable prudence to minimize Losses therefrom. The Indemnified Party
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection with any Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
14.3.2(a), (i) in any event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control, pay or settle any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party
shall have undertaken to defend so long as (1) the Indemnified Party shall
also waive any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnifying Party,
and (2)

 



      
 

 



 

the consent to the entry of any judgment, or the entry into any settlement,
compromise or discharge, with respect to any such Third Party Claim, (I) does
not impose monetary damages, injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates, and (II) does not contain or
involve an admission or statement providing for or acknowledging any liability
or criminal wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnifying Party or any of its
Affiliates, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party (x) for any period after
notice thereof during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the
defense thereof, and (y) if, based on the advice of counsel, a conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in
respect of the matters subject to such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any
settlement, compromise or discharge, with respect to any Third Party Claim,
and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to withhold its consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claims that (i) does not involve as the sole remedy monetary damages that are
fully borne by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not contain an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such
Third Party Claim, (iii) imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (iv) contains or involves
an admission or statement providing for or acknowledging any liability or
criminal wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any
settlement, compromise or discharge of any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which may be conditioned or delayed
in its reasonable discretion.

 



 

(c) If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment on an Indemnified Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or
other claims or benefits of the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article 14_ to the contrary, in no
event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be required to deliver any notice of
any Third Party Claim relating to the matters for which the Buyer Parties are
indemnified pursuant to _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and
_14.2.2(f)_ and which Third Party Claim had been made or was in existence
prior to the Initial Closing Date.

 



 

14.3.3 The Parties agree that any indemnification payments made with respect
to this Agreement, including under this _Section 14.3_, shall be treated for
all Tax

 



   

     
 

 



 

purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price hereunder unless otherwise
required by Law (including by a determination of a Tax authority that, under
applicable Law, is not subject to further review or appeal).

 



 

14.4 _Existing Claims_. LBHI acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of
this Agreement, (a) the Archstone Entities have suffered Losses in connection
with the Acquisition Litigation, including legal fees and related expenses,
and (b) LBHI shall be responsible for indemnifying and holding harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with _Section 14.2.2_ for all Losses
of the Archstone Entities relating to the matters set forth in _Section
14.2.2_ (including all legal fees and related expenses, subject to _Section
14.5_, relating to such matters, except that LBHI shall not be required to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any legal fees and related
expenses, settlement payments or other amounts relating to the matters set
forth in _Section 14.2.2_ to the extent that such legal fees and related
expenses relate to services performed on or before September 30, 2012 or such
settlement payment or other amounts were paid on or prior to September 30,
2012). In the event LBHI fails to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party with
respect to the matters set forth in _Sections 14.2.2(d)_ or _14.2.2(e)_ in
accordance with this _Article 14_, then all of the rights and interests of
the Lehman Entities to indemnification pursuant to the terms of the Lehman
IPAs with respect to the matters set forth in sections 12.2.2(b) and 12.2.2(c)
thereof applicable with respect to periods beginning on or after October 1,
2012, shall, to the extent assignable, be automatically assigned to such Buyer
Indemnified Party, without any further action by any Party hereto; _provided_
, _however_ , that after the Buyer Indemnified Parties have recovered the
Losses for which LBHI failed to pay, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall pay
the Lehman Entities any remaining proceeds recovered by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to the Lehman IPAs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Lehman
Entities (i) do not make any representation or warranty regarding the
effectiveness of such assignment, and (ii) shall be entitled to all of the
rights of indemnification pursuant to the terms of the Lehman IPAs (and the
Buyer Parties and Archstone Entities shall have no rights thereunder) unless
LBHI fails to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to matters
set forth in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ (but in no
event shall the Buyer Parties or Archstone Entities have any rights to
indemnification under the Lehman IPAs with respect to any legal fees or
related expenses incurred during any period prior to October 1, 2012 or any
settlement payments or other amounts paid on or prior to September 30, 2012).
For the further avoidance of doubt, the assignment of the rights under the
Lehman IPAs shall not be deemed to relieve LBHI of any Liability for failure
to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Parties as required hereunder.

 



 

14.5 _Litigation Cooperation_. With respect to the matters in _Sections
14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ , Proceedings exist as
of the date hereof (the " _Existing Proceedings_ "). Seller shall defend and
control the Existing Proceedings, and the Buyer Parties acknowledge (x) that
counsel currently defending the Existing Proceedings satisfy the requirements
of _Section 14.3.2(a)_ and shall continue to defend the Existing Proceedings
and any future litigation or Proceeding arising out of or relating to
_Sections 14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ , and (y)
that LBHI shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for
any of the fees and expenses of counsel employed by any Buyer Indemnified
Party other than the reasonable fees and expenses of one set of counsel for
all Buyer Indemnified Parties to monitor (but not actively participate in) the
Existing Proceedings. Each Buyer Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each
of the Archstone Entities to, at LBHIs sole cost and expense,

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably cooperate with Seller and the Lehman Entities in the defense of any
Third Party Claim relating to any of the matters in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ ,
_14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ , including (a) promptly informing
Seller of the receipt of any notices, correspondence, Filings or other
communications with respect to the matters described in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ ,
_14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ , (b) by providing Seller or the
Lehman Entities with access to records, documents or other information of the
Archstone Entities or any of their Affiliates to the extent relevant to the
matters described in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ , _14.2.2(e)_ and
_14.2.2(f)_ , and (c) providing Seller and the Lehman Entities access to
employees of the Archstone Entities and making such employees available for
interviews and testimony as reasonably requested and upon reasonable notice
(provided that such employees shall be made so available upon reasonable
notice and for a reasonable time without charge other than out-of-pocket
expenses). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause
each of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties to, cause the Archstone Entities
not to enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge of any claims with
respect to the matters described in _Sections 14.2.2(c)_ , _14.2.2(d)_ ,
_14.2.2(e)_ and _14.2.2(f)_ without the prior written consent of Seller,
which may be conditioned or delayed in its sole discretion.

 



 

14.6 _Third Party Recovery_. In calculating the amount of any Losses payable
under this _Article 14_, there shall be deducted from any such Losses payable
to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to any payment received from a third
party (including an insurer) by such Indemnified Party in respect of any such
Loss (or by an Archstone Entity, in respect of any Losses by the Archstone
Entities for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified). If an Indemnified
Party recovers an amount from a third party (including an insurer) in respect
of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a
portion of such Loss has been paid by the Indemnifying Party hereunder
pursuant to this _Article 14_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount actually received
from the Third Party in respect thereof, over (ii) the full amount of the
Loss.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 15 
TERMINATION**

 



 

15.1 _Termination of Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

Date (as such date may be extended in accordance with _Section 2.4_) (it
being understood that the Buyer Parties may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 15.1.2(a)_ unless the closing conditions set forth
in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ , or _10.1_ (other than those conditions which by
their

 



      
 

 



 

nature are to be satisfied as part of the Initial Closing) have not been
satisfied or they simultaneously pay the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount to
LBHI or the applicable Lehman Designee in immediately available funds to a
bank account designated in writing by LBHI); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 15.1.2(a)_ shall not be
available to LBHI if the conditions set forth in _Sections 10.1.1_ and
_10.1.2_ are not satisfied;

 



 

(b) if there is any Law that makes consummation of a Substantial Portion of
the Contemplated Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

 



 

(c) if a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction having valid
enforcement authority issues a final Order, not subject to appeal, permanently
restraining, prohibiting or enjoining any Buyer Party, Seller and/or any
Lehman Entity from consummating a Substantial Portion **** of the Contemplated
Transactions, _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 15.1.2(c)_ shall not be available to any Party that has
initiated any Proceeding that results in such Order, or that has not taken any
and all reasonable actions necessary to oppose, contest and resist, and to
have lifted, rescinded or vacated, such order, decree or judgment before it
became final and non-appealable.

 



 

15.1.3 _Breach/Failure to Perform_.

 



 

(a) Either of the Buyer Parties may terminate this Agreement by written notice
to LBHI in the event of a breach by Seller or any Lehman Entity of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement, where
the effect of such breach would be to cause any of the conditions to the
Initial Closing set forth in _Sections10.1.1_ through _10.1.6_ to not be
satisfied, and such breach is not cured by Seller or a Lehman Entity, as
applicable, within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of written
notice from any Buyer Party of the breach or alleged breach, which written
notice shall state that, unless such breach is cured in accordance with this
_Section 15.1.3(a)_, a Buyer Party intends to terminate this Agreement (it
being understood that such twenty (20) Business Day cure period (the " _Seller
Cure Period_ ") shall extend the then-current Outside Closing Date (and the
other Buyer Party hereby consents to such termination).

 



 

(b) LBHI may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Buyer Parties
in the event of a breach by the Buyer Parties of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement under this Agreement, where the effect of such breach
would be to cause any of the conditions to the Initial Closing set forth in
_Sections 11.1.1_ through _11.1.6_ to not be satisfied, and such breach is not
cured by the Buyer Parties within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt
of written notice from LBHI of the breach or alleged breach, which written
notice shall state that, unless such breach is

 



      
 

 



 

cured in accordance with this _Section 15.1.3(b)_, that LBHI intends to
terminate this Agreement (it being understood that such twenty (20)-Business
Day cure period (the " _Buyer Cure Period_ ") shall not extend the then-
current Outside Closing Date, unless (i) the Buyer Parties have certified that
the Buyer Parties are ready, willing and able to, and unconditionally
obligated to, proceed immediately with the Initial Closing on or prior to the
then-current Outside Closing Date, and (ii) Seller and LBHI have indicated
that they are not ready, willing and able to, and unconditionally obligated
to, proceed immediately with the Initial Closing as a result of the breach by
the Buyer Parties of the conditions set forth in _Section 11.1.1_ or _Section
11.1.2_, in which case, the then-current Outside Closing Date shall be
extended by the Buyer Cure Period).

 



 

15.1.4 _Satisfaction of Conditions to Closing_.

 



 

(a) Either of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, or LBHI, on the other hand,
may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Parties if any
event shall occur after the date of this Agreement that shall have made it
impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the terminating Partys
obligations to perform its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that (i) Buyer
Parties shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 15.1.4(a)_ if any Buyer Party is then in breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder (I) that
would result in the closing conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ and
_ 11.1.1_ through _11.1.6_ not being satisfied, and (II) that has not been
cured following the Buyer Cure Period, and (ii) LBHI shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 15.1.4(a)_ if LBHI,
Seller or any other Lehman Entity is then in breach of representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that (x) would result in
the closing conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ and _ 10.1.1_
through _10.1.6_ not being satisfied, and (y) that have not been cured
following the Seller Cure Period (and if either Buyer Party terminates
pursuant to this _Section 15.1.4(a)_, the other Buyer Party hereby consents
to such termination).

 



 

(b) If all of the conditions precedent to the Buyer Parties obligations to
perform their obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
hereunder (other than any Contemplated Transactions relating to Deferred
Closing Assets for which an Extension Closing will occur and other than those
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied as part of the Initial
Closing) have been satisfied and the Buyer Parties fail to timely perform such
obligations by the then-current Outside Closing Date (as extended in
accordance with _Section 2.4_), LBHI may terminate this Agreement.

 



 

15.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement and the abandonment of the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to
_Section 15.1_:

 



      
 

 



 

15.2.1 this Agreement shall forthwith terminate, except that _Section 13.7_,
_Section 13.10_, this _Section 15.2_, _Section 15.3_ and _Article 16_, the
obligations of the Buyer Parties set forth on _Schedule 12.3_ and all
applicable definitions in this Agreement shall survive such termination;

 



 

15.2.2 each member of the Buyer Group shall return all documents, work papers
and other materials (and all copies thereof) obtained from any Lehman Entity,
any Archstone Entity, Seller or any of their respective Representatives
relating to the Contemplated Transactions, whether so obtained before or after
the execution hereof, to Seller and otherwise comply with the terms of the
confidentiality agreements described in _Section 12.6_;

 



 

15.2.3 Seller and LBHI shall return all documents, work papers and other
materials (and all copies thereof) obtained from any member of the Buyer Group
or any of its Representatives relating to the Contemplated Transactions,
whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to ERPOP or AVB, as
applicable;

 



 

15.2.4 all filings, applications and other submissions made to any Person,
including any Governmental Authority, in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from such Person;

 



 

15.2.5 there shall be no Liability on the part of any Buyer Party, except to
the extent, and solely to the extent, provided in _Section 15.3.1_ (except as
expressly provided in the last sentence of _Section 2.1.1_); and

 



 

15.2.6 there shall be no Liability on the part of Seller or LBHI hereunder,
except to the extent, and solely to the extent, provided in _Section 15.3.2_
and _Section 15.3.3_ (subject to the proviso appearing at the end of _Section
15.3.3_).

 



 

15.3 _Remedies_.

 



 

15.3.1 In the event that this Agreement is terminated by LBHI in accordance
_Section 15.1.3(b)_, _Section 15.1.4(a)_ (at a time when any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_, _9.2_ , _11.1.1_ , _11.1.2_ , _11.1.4_
, _11.1.5_ or _11.1.6_ have not been satisfied following the Buyer Cure
Period) or _Section 15.1.4(b)_, then the Buyer Parties shall pay to Seller,
within five (5) Business Days following the date of such termination, the
Seller Liquidated Damages Amount in immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing by Seller, it being understood that, in no event
shall the Buyer Parties, collectively, be required to pay the Seller
Liquidated Damages Amount on more than one occasion. Other than as provided in
Section 3(e) of _Schedule 12.3_ , the right of Seller and the Lehman Entities,
collectively, to receive payment of the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount shall
be their sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for any Losses
suffered by Seller or the Lehman Entities as a result of the failure of the
Initial Closing to occur (including as a result of a breach or failure by any
Buyer Party to perform its obligations hereunder or any willful breach or

 



      
 

 



 

fraud on the part of any Buyer Party); _provided_ , _however_ , if LBHI or
Seller commences a suit against any of the Buyer Parties in order to obtain
such payment, the prevailing party (after a final, non-appealable judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction) shall be entitled to recover from the other
party its documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit (including any and all appeals).
Upon payment of such amounts, none of the Buyer Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation as a result of the failure by any Buyer Party
to consummate the Initial Closing (other than as provided in Section 3(e) of
_Schedule 12.3_ ). Upon payment of the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount (and
any amounts due and owing pursuant to Section 3(e) of _Schedule 12.3_ ), none
of the Buyer Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions,
and no Person shall have any rights or claims against the Buyer Related
Parties **** under this Agreement or otherwise, whether at Law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. For purposes of clarity, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that neither Seller nor any of the Lehman Entities shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the Buyer Parties or otherwise obtain any other relief at Law,
equity or otherwise to obtain specific performance (except as specifically
provided in _Sections 2.1.1_ and _2.5.2(h)_ and except as provided in the
proviso appearing in the parenthetical at the end of _Section 15.4_).

 



 

15.3.2 In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Buyer Parties in
accordance with _Sections 15.1.3(a)_ or _15.1.4(a)_ (at a time when any of
the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_, _9.2_ , _10.1.1_ , _10.1.2_ ,
_10.1.4_ , _10.1.5_ or _10.1.6_ have not been satisfied following the Seller
Cure Period), then LBHI shall pay to the Buyer Parties, within five (5)
Business Days following the receipt of a written demand and documentation
supporting the amount set forth therein, an amount in cash equal to all actual
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
fees payable pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreements referenced in _Section
13.12_ (with legal and accounting fees being based on standard hourly
billing), but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any fees payable to
financial advisors other than their out-of-pocket costs) incurred by the Buyer
Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions prior to the date of such termination (the "
_Expenses Amount_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 15.3.3_, the right of
the Buyer Parties, collectively, to receive payment of the Expenses Amount
shall be their sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for any Losses
suffered by the Buyer Parties or their Affiliates as a result of the
termination of this Agreement by the Buyer Parties in accordance with
_Sections 15.1.3(a)_ or _15.1.4(a)_ as a result of a breach of this
Agreement by Seller, any of the Lehman Entities or any of the Archstone
Entities. Subject to _Section 15.3.3_, upon payment of such amount, none of
LBHI, Seller, any Archstone Entity or any of their Affiliates shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Contemplated Transactions, and no Person shall have any rights or
claims

 



      
 

 



 

against Seller, LBHI, any Archstone Entity or any of their Affiliates under
this Agreement or otherwise, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the right of the Buyer
Parties to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Sections 15.1.3(a)_
or _15.1.4(a)_ as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Seller, any of
the Lehman Entities or any of the Archstone Entities and recover the Expenses
Amount shall not preclude the exercise of the Buyer Parties rights under
_Section 15.4_ prior to a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
15.1.3(a)_ or _Section 15.1.4(a)_;.

 



 

15.3.3 In addition, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Buyer Parties in accordance with _Sections 15.1.3(a)_ or _15.1.4(a)_ as a
result of a breach by Seller or LBHI of their representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder resulting from the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of Seller or LBHI that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse impact on the Contemplated Transactions
for the Buyer Parties, then the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to all
remedies available at Law or equity arising from such breach; _provided_ that
to the extent that the Buyer Parties bring any action seeking specific
performance of any of Sellers or LBHIs obligations hereunder, the Buyer
Parties shall be deemed to have waived their rights under this _Section
15.3.3_.

 



 

15.3.4 Seller and the Lehman Entities agree that (a) the Contemplated
Transactions are unique and that damages for failure by the Buyer Parties to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions will be extremely difficult and
impracticable to ascertain, (b) the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount is a
reasonable and rational estimate at this time and is an acceptable damages
amount to Seller and the Lehman Entities upon the occurrence of the events
described in _Section 15.3.1_, and (c) the Seller Liquidated Damages Amount
is not intended as a penalty, but as full liquidated damages under this
Agreement and as compensation for Sellers and the Lehman Entities losses and
other expenses associated with the failure of the Buyer Parties to close the
Contemplated Transactions pursuant to this Agreement. The agreements contained
in this _Section 15.3_ are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions
and the Parties agree that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. In addition, the Parties acknowledge that in the
absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required by a court and the
Parties hereby waive any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking.

 



 

15.4 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that the Buyer Parties would
suffer irreparable damage in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, subject to
the terms of _Section 15.3_, each of the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof pursuant to this _Section 15.4_. It
is accordingly agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions of _Section
15.3_, any Buyer Party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
by LBHI and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement; it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the first
sentence of this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 15.4_ or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, a Buyer
Partys right to specific performance to require LBHI to consummate the
Initial Closing or any Extension Closing shall remain subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable Party) of the conditions to the
Initial Closing or any Extension Closing, as applicable, hereunder. Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
hereby waived. Except as set forth in _Section 15.3.2_ and _Section 15.3.3_
following a termination pursuant to _Section 15.1.3(a)_ or _Section
15.1.4(a)_, the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates shall not be entitled to
any monetary damages if LBHI or Seller fail to close the Contemplated
Transactions (but this does not limit the obligations of LBHI pursuant to
_Article 14_ after the Initial Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, Seller
and the Lehman Entities shall not have any right under this _Section 15.4_ or
otherwise to obtain a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance, or any other equitable relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction to cause the consummation of the Initial Closing or
any Extension Closing (except as specifically set forth in _Sections 2.1.1_
and _2.5.2(h)_ ), _provided_ that Seller and the Lehman Entities do not waive
any rights to specific performance of covenants that apply solely after the
Initial Closing.

16.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the other Transaction
Documents, and the other documents and instruments referred to herein and
therein) and the Disclosure Schedules sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties in respect of the Contemplated Transactions and
supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements and
understandings, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. There are no warranties, representations or other agreements
between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement,
except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

16.3 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 



 

16.3.1 Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written instrument signed by Seller, LBHI, ERPOP and AVB.

 



 

16.3.2 No waiver hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set forth in
writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of the waiver
is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the
specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties of a breach of or a default
under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the
Parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver
of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as otherwise
provided herein, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

16.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, performed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving
effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether
at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the AVB
Lenders or the ERPOP Lenders in any way relating to the Debt Commitment
Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

16.5 _Jurisdiction and Venue_.

 



 

16.5.1 Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
any state appellate courts therefrom within the State of Delaware. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, agrees
that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions in any court

 



      
 

 



 

other than the aforesaid courts and waives any objection to venue laid
therein. Process in any such Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware. Without limiting
the foregoing, Sellers and the Buyer Parties agree that service of process
upon such Party at the address referred to in _Section 16.1_ , together with
written notice of such service to such Party, shall be deemed effective
service of process upon such Party.

 



 

16.5.2 Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to
this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with _Section 16.1_ , (b) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the Proceeding in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Proceeding is
improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



 

16.5.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any person
in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind of description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the AVB Lenders or the
ERPOP Lenders in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
within the City of New York.

 



 

16.6 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_.

 



 

16.6.1 EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE. THIS WAIVER MAY
NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN
WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS

 



      
 

 



 

 _SECTION 16.6.1_ ) AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO). THIS WAIVER
SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS RELATING
TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. The scope of this waiver is intended to be
all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and
that relate to the subject matter of the Contemplated Transactions, including
contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law
and statutory claims. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed
as a written consent to a trial by the court.

 



 

16.6.2 EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH
WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 16.6_.

 



 

16.7 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure solely to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i) neither Seller nor any of its subsidiaries,
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders shall have any right or claim against any of the AVB
Lenders or the ERPOP Lenders, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at Law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise and (ii) the AVB Lenders or the ERPOP Lenders shall not
have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to Seller or
any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating to in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at Law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit, limit or modify any action by
the Buyer Parties to enforce the rights or obligations contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent permitted therein.

 



 

16.8 _Interpretation_. As used in this Agreement and required by the context,
the singular and plural shall be deemed to include all genders; words
importing persons shall include

 



      
 

 



 

partnerships, corporations and other entities; when reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated; and the terms "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" or other similar
terms, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not only to the particular
sentence, subsection or section in which any such term may be employed.
Whenever in this Agreement the word "including" is used, it shall be deemed to
be for purposes of identifying only one or more of the possible alternatives,
and the entire provision in which such word appears shall be read as if the
phrase "including without limitation" were actually used in the text. The
section headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction hereof. All references to dollars (or the symbol "$") contained
herein shall be deemed to refer to United States dollars. Where any provision
in this Agreement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such
Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether
the action in question is taken directly or indirectly by such Person. Except
when used together with the word "either" or otherwise for the purpose of
identifying mutually exclusive alternatives, the term "or" has the inclusive
meaning represented by the phrase "and/or". With regard to each and every term
and condition of this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that the
same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and that if
at any time the Parties desire or are required to interpret or construe any
such term or condition or any agreement or instrument subject thereto, no
consideration shall be given to the issue of which Party actually prepared,
drafted or requested any term or condition of this Agreement.

 



 

16.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, such term, provision, covenant
or restriction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, and the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Contemplated
Transactions shall be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

16.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. It is the express
intent of the Parties to be bound by the exchange of signatures on this
Agreement via facsimile or electronic mail via the portable document format
(PDF). A facsimile or other copy of a signature shall be deemed an original.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties hereto. Until
and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
Parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have
any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication).

 



      
 

 



 

16.11 _Third Parties_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein
(including _Section 13.14.2_ in regard to the Archstone Indemnitees), no
provision of this Agreement is intended or shall confer on any Person, other
than the Parties (and their successors and permitted assigns), any rights
under this Agreement and no other Person shall be entitled to rely thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the AVB Lenders and the ERPOP Lenders shall be
third party beneficiaries to this _Section 16.11_ and _Sections 15.3_ , _16.4_
, _16.5_ , _16.6_ and _16.7_.

 



 

16.12 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by
any Party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party shall
have the right to assign all or certain provisions of this Agreement, or any
interest herein, and may delegate any duty or obligation hereunder, without
the consent of the other Parties, (i) to any Affiliate of such Party, or (ii)
at any time after the Initial Closing, to any purchaser of all or
substantially all of the assets or Equity Interests (whether by merger,
recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) of such Party; _provided_ that,
in the case of each of clauses (i) through (ii), no such assignment or
delegation shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
attempted assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this _Section
16.12_ shall be null and void.

 



 

16.13 _Joint and Several Obligations_. For purposes of clarity, (a) all
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings (to the
extent they survive) of the Buyer Parties, the Buyer Designees, ERPOP or AVB
set forth in this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 2.2.1_ , _Section
2.2.2_ , _Section 2.3.2_ , _Section 2.3.3_ , _Section 2.5.2(h)_ , _Section
2.6.3_ , _Section 13.1.1_ , _Section 13.1.4_ , _Section 13.6.1_ , _Section
13.14_ and _Section 14.2.1_ , shall be the joint and several obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings of ERPOP and AVB, and
(b) all obligations, representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings
(to the extent they survive) of Seller or LBHI set forth in this Agreement
shall be the joint and several obligations, representations, warranties,
covenants and undertakings of Seller and LBHI.

 



 

16.14 _Cash Payments_. All cash amounts payable pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the applicable Party
to receive such cash amount, which account or accounts shall be designated no
later than three (3) days prior to the Initial Closing Date or other date of
applicable payment hereunder, unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable
Parties.

 



 

16.15 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The schedules and exhibits, if any, referenced
in this Agreement constitute an integral part of this Agreement and are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any information
disclosed in a schedule or a section of any such schedule shall be deemed to
be disclosed in such other schedules or sections of any such schedule to the
extent that the disclosure is reasonably apparent from its face to be
applicable to such other schedule or section of any such schedule. Disclosure
of any fact or item in any schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
admission that such item or fact is material for the purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

16.16 _Time Periods_. Any action required hereunder to be taken within a
certain number of days shall, unless otherwise provided herein, be taken
within that number of calendar days; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the last
day for taking such action falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a

 



      
 

 



 

legal holiday, the period during which such action may be taken shall be
extended to the next Business Day. Time shall be of the essence with respect
to all obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

16.17 _No Recourse Against Non-Parties_. All claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, at Law or in equity) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or the Contemplated Transactions, may be made only against the
entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto. No Person who is not
a named Party to this Agreement, including any director, trustee, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or Representative of any named Party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party
Affiliates_ "), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, at
Law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of
an entity Party against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or
Liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation or execution; and each Party hereto waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.
