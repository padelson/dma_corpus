<Page>

any double counting that any amount or item which would otherwise be included in
the calculation of Net Working Capital but is otherwise an addition or deduction
pursuant to the calculation of Total Transaction Consideration shall be excluded
from the calculation of Net Working Capital, both as of the Determination Date
and as of February 28, 2001. By way of example only and for purposes of

Consideration using the Harveys balance sheet as of February 28, 2001.

      (c) On or prior to the Closing Date, Harveys shall deliver a calculation
of the Total Transaction Consideration as of the Closing Date, using the form of
calculation thereof as illustrated in Exhibit 1.3(b) hereto (the "Closing
Schedule"). The Total Transaction Consideration shall be paid by Harrah's to
Sellers in accordance with this Section 1.3 on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
any change with respect to Harveys' accounting policies or procedures subsequent
to the date hereof, the accounting policies and procedures used to calculate
Total Transaction Consideration or to produce the Closing Statement shall be the
same as those in effect on the date hereof.

      (d) Post-Closing Adjustment. If within twenty days following the Closing
Date Harrah's has not given to the Sellers' Representative notice of its
objection to the Closing Schedule (such notice must contain a statement of the
basis of Harrah's' objection), then the Total Transaction Consideration as
calculated pursuant to the foregoing shall be deemed accepted. If Harrah's gives
such notice of objection, then the issues in dispute will be submitted to
Deloitte & Touche LLP, certified public accountants (the "Accountants"), for
resolution and the Accountants shall issue a report with respect to such issue
not later than 20 days after such submission. If issues in dispute are submitted
to the Accountants for resolution, (i) each party will furnish to the
Accountants such workpapers and other documents and information relating to the
disputed issues as the Accountants may request and are available to that party
or its Subsidiaries (or its independent public accountants), and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountants any material relating to
the determination and to discuss the determination with the Accountants; (ii)
the determination by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered to both
parties by the Accountants, will be binding and conclusive on the parties; and
(iii) Harrah's and the Sellers will each bear 50% of the fees of the Accountants
for such determination; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Accountants determine
that the Total Transaction Consideration should be adjusted downward by an
amount in excess of $5.0 million or upward by an amount in excess of $5.0
million, then Sellers, in the case of a downward adjustment, or Harrah's, in the
case of an upward adjustment, shall bear the fees of such Accountants.

      (e) On the third business day following the earlier of (i) the final
determination by the Accountants of the amount of the Total Transaction
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3(d), if such Total Transaction
Consideration is greater than the aggregate of the payments made pursuant to
Section 1.3(b), Harrah's will pay the difference to Sellers and holders of
Options cashed out pursuant to Section 2.1 and other Harveys stockholders that
have not executed Joinders and whose shares have been repurchased by Harveys at
Closing, to be allocated on a per share basis consistent with the manner
utilized at Closing, and if such Total Transaction Consideration is less than
such aggregate amount, Sellers and holders of Options cashed out pursuant to
Section 2.1 and other Harveys stockholders that have not executed Joinders and
whose shares have been repurchased by Harveys at Closing, on a per share basis
consistent with


                                       3
<Page>

the manner utilized at Closing, will pay the difference to Harrah's. All
payments will be made together with interest at 7.0% compounded daily beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the date of payment. Payments must be made in
immediately available funds. Payments to Harrah's must be made by wire transfer
to such bank account as Harrah's will specify.

      Section 1.4 Closing Deliveries.

      (a)   Sellers will deliver to Harrah's on the Closing Date:

            (i) certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed (or

            (ii) the resignation of Thomas J. Barrack, Jr. as the sole director
of Harveys and each of its Subsidiaries;

            (iii) FIRPTA certificates in form and substance reasonably

            (iv) a certificate executed by each Seller to the effect that such
Seller's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement were true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and are
accurate in all material respects as of the Closing Date as though made on and
as of the Closing Date, except for changes contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement; and

      (b)   Harrah's will deliver to Sellers on the Closing Date:

1.3, via wire transfer as directed by the Sellers' Representative in writing;
and

            (ii) the certificates required by Sections 7.2(a) and 7.2(b).

      (c)   Harrah's will deliver to Harveys on the Closing Date:

            (i) the capital contribution to Harveys as specified in Section 2.1;
and

            (ii) any amounts required to repurchase shares of other Rabbit
stockholders that have not executed Joinders pursuant to Section 6.13 that are
being repurchased at Closing.

                                  ARTICLE II.
                   EFFECT OF THE CLOSING ON OPTIONS OF HARVEYS

      Section 2.1 Harveys Option Plan. Concurrently with the Closing, each
unexpired and unexercised outstanding option, whether or not then vested or
exercisable in accordance with its terms, to purchase shares of Harveys Common
Stock ("Options") previously granted by Harveys or its Subsidiaries under
Harveys' 1999 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Harveys Stock Option Plan") will
become exercisable in full and each holder of an Option shall be entitled to
receive from Harveys in cancellation thereof a payment (subject to applicable
income tax withholding,


                                       4
<Page>

employer taxes and a holdback amount set forth in the Sellers' Representative
Certificate) in an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the applicable
Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as the case may be, over the per
share exercise price of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Harveys Common Stock subject to such Option (the "Option Settlement Amount").
The Option Settlement Amount, less the holdback amount set forth in the Sellers'
Representative Certificate, shall be paid in cash concurrently with the Closing.
In order to facilitate such payment, Harrah's concurrently with the Closing
shall acquire shares of capital stock from Harveys for an aggregate purchase
price equal to the aggregate Option Settlement Amount (plus applicable income
tax withholding, employer taxes and heldback amounts) payable to all such
Harveys Option holders. The Option Settlement Amount shall be paid in cash
concurrently with the Closing. From and after the Closing, there shall be no
outstanding and exercisable Options. The surrender of an Option shall be deemed
a release of any and all rights the holder had or may have in respect of such
Option. The Harveys Stock Option Plan and any and all other agreements, plans,
programs or arrangements of Harveys and its Subsidiaries that provide for the
issuance or grant of Options or any other interest in respect of the capital
stock of Harveys or capital stock of or other ownership interest in any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate as of the Closing. Immediately following the
Closing, no holder of an Option or any participant in the Harveys Stock Option
Plan or any other agreement, plan, program or arrangement of Harveys shall have
any right thereunder to acquire equity securities or other ownership interests
of Harveys or any Subsidiary thereof.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HARVEYS

      Harveys represents and warrants to Harrah's that the statements contained
in this Article III are true and correct except as set forth herein and in the
disclosure schedule delivered by Harveys to Harrah's on or before the date of
this Agreement (the "Harveys Disclosure Schedule"). The Harveys Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this Article III.

      Section 3.1 Organization of Harveys and its Subsidiaries. Each of Harveys
and its Subsidiaries (as defined below) is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be
conducted prior to the Closing. Each of Harveys and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would
not have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, condition
(financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of Harveys and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any of the three separate businesses operated
as the Harveys Resort & Casino -- Lake Tahoe, Harveys Casino/Hotel Council
Bluffs and Bluffs Run Casino (a "Harveys Material Adverse Effect"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the following, individually and in the aggregate, shall be
excluded from the definition of "Harveys Material Adverse Effect" and from any
determination as to whether any Harveys Material Adverse Effect has occurred or
may occur: any


                                       5
<Page>

reduction, in and of itself, in historic or prospective revenues, net income or
EBITDA of Harveys C.C. Management Company, Inc. or Harveys Wagon Wheel
Hotel/Casino. Harveys has delivered to Harrah's a true and correct copy of the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Harveys and each of its Subsidiaries, in
each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. Assuming compliance by
Harrah's, its Subsidiaries and their key employees with all Harveys Gaming Laws
(as defined in Section 3.15(b)) (including obtaining all necessary consents and
approvals), the respective organizational documents of Harveys' Subsidiaries do
not contain any provision that would limit or otherwise restrict the ability of
Harrah's, following the Closing, from owning or operating such Subsidiaries on
the same basis as Harveys. Except as set forth in Harveys SEC Reports (as
defined in Section 3.4(a)) filed prior to the date hereof or as disclosed in
Section 3.1 of the Harveys Disclosure Schedule, neither Harveys nor any of its
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns (other than ownership interests in
Harveys or in one or more of its Subsidiaries) any equity or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity.
As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any
party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is
a general partner or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the
Board of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled
by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such party and
one or more of its Subsidiaries.

Options under the plan were granted, the number of Options granted on each such
date and the exercise price thereof. Since February 28, 2001, Harveys has not
made any grants under the Harveys Stock Option Plan. As of the date of this
Agreement, Harveys has not granted any stock appreciation rights or any other
contractual rights the value of which is derived from the financial performance
of Harveys or the value of shares of Harveys Common Stock. There are no
obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Harveys Common Stock or
the capital stock or ownership interests of any Subsidiary or to provide funds
to or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or any other entity other than guarantees
of bank obligations or


                                       6

indebtedness for borrowed money entered into in the ordinary course of business.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock (including shares which have been
issued upon exercise of outstanding options) or other ownership interests of
each of Harveys' Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and, except as disclosed in Section 3.2(a) of the Harveys
Disclosure Schedule, all such shares and ownership interests are owned by
Harveys or another Subsidiary of Harveys free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations on Harveys' voting
rights, charges or other encumbrances or restrictions on transfer of any nature,
other than imposed by applicable gaming laws.

      (b)   There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries having voting rights (or convertible into
securities having such rights) ("Voting Debt") issued and outstanding. Except as
set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Harveys Disclosure Schedule or as reserved
for future grants of options or restricted stock under the Harveys Stock Option
Plan as of the date hereof, (i) there are no shares of capital stock of any
class of Harveys, or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such
equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding; (ii) there are
no options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments or

shares of capital stock or other ownership interests (including Voting Debt) of

which it or they are bound with respect to the shares of capital stock of
Harveys. All shares of Harveys Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in
this Section 3.2(b) are duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Harveys shall have the
right at the Closing pursuant to the Harveys stock option and restricted stock
agreements to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Harveys Common Stock,
other than those held by any Seller, for the same price per share as the price
to be paid to Sellers.

      (c)   Section 3.2(c) of the Harveys Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
stockholders of Harveys and the number of shares of Harveys Common Stock owned
by each.

      Section 3.3 Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

      (a)   Harveys has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions to which it is a party
that are contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Harveys and the consummation by Harveys of the transactions to
which it is a party that are contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Harveys. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Harveys and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other parties
hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Harveys, enforceable
against Harveys in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
now or hereinafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii)
general principles of equity.

      (b)   Other than as disclosed in Section 3.3(b) of the Harveys Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Harveys does not, and
the consummation by Harveys of the transactions to which it is a party that are
contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
of Harveys or the comparable charter or bylaws of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit)
under, or require a consent or waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other
agreement, instrument or obligation to which Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
bound, or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred
to in Section 3.3(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession,
franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for any
such breaches, conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, losses or failures to obtain any such consent or waiver which (x)
are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Harveys
Material Adverse Effect or (y) would not materially impair or materially delay
the Closing.

      (c)   No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency, commission, gaming
authority or other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental
Entity") is required by or with respect to Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries in

      (a)   Harveys has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by Harveys with the SEC since February 28, 1999 (collectively, the
"Harveys SEC Reports"). The Harveys SEC Reports (including any financial
statements filed as a part thereof or incorporated by reference therein) (i) at
the time filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent filing), complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and
(ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent
filing), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in such Harveys SEC Reports or necessary in
order to make the statements in such Harveys SEC Reports, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Harveys'
Subsidiaries is required to file forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

      (b)   Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes) of Harveys contained in the Harveys SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in
effect at the time of such filing, was prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in effect at the time of such
preparation applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act)
and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of Harveys and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates, and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods,
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which, with respect to
interim periods since November 30, 2000, were not or are not expected to be
material in amount. The unaudited balance sheet of Harveys as of February 28,
2001 is referred to herein as the "Harveys Balance Sheet."

      Section 3.5 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the Harveys
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or in Section 3.5 of the Harveys
Disclosure Schedule, and except for liabilities and obligations incurred since
November 30, 2000 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, Harveys and its consolidated Subsidiaries do not have any
indebtedness, obligations or liabilities of any kind, whether accrued,
contingent or otherwise (whether or not required to be reflected in financial
statements in accordance with GAAP), and whether due or to become due, which
would be reasonably likely to have a Harveys Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Harveys nor its Subsidiaries has any financial obligation in respect of its or
their interest in the City of South Lake Tahoe redevelopment plan pursuant to

                        (A) No Pension Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
            the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code. Each
            Pension Plan and each related trust that is intended to qualify
            under the provisions of Code Section 401(a) and 501(a) has so
            qualified during the period from its adoption to date.

                        (B) Each Employee Plan has been maintained in material
            compliance with its terms and, both as to form and in operation,
            with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable laws,
            including without limitation ERISA and the Code to the extent
            applicable.

                        (C) (i) The methodologies used by Harveys to determine
            participants' benefits and Harveys' liabilities under Harveys'
            Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, Senior Supplemental
            Executive Retirement Plan and Section 7 of the Change of Control
            Plan, as such methodologies have been disclosed to Harrah's, are a
            reasonable application of the terms of such plans, (ii) Harveys'
            calculation of the participants' benefits and Harveys' liabilities


                                       18
<Page>

            thereunder as disclosed to Harrah's are accurate and consistent with
            such methodologies and (iii) Harveys has consistently applied such
            methodologies in the past. The seven participants in Harveys' Change
            of Control Plan listed in that certain Resolution 2001-9 of the
            Board of Directors of Harveys Casino Resorts Reaffirming
            Participants in Harveys Casino Resorts Change of Control Plan,
            attached hereto as Exhibit 3.14(c) are the only participants under
            Harveys' Change of Control Plan.

            (ii) Multiemployer Plans

                        (A) Neither Harveys nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any
            time, withdrawn from a Multiemployer Plan in a "complete withdrawal"
            or a "partial withdrawal" as defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of
            ERISA, respectively, so as to result in a liability, contingent or
            otherwise (including without limitation the obligations pursuant to
            an agreement entered into in accordance with Section 4204 of ERISA),
            of Harveys or any ERISA Affiliate which has not been fully
            satisfied. Neither Harveys nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in,
            or is a successor or parent corporation to an entity that has
            engaged in, a transaction described in Section 4212(c) of ERISA. If,
            as of the Closing Date, Harveys (and all ERISA Affiliates) were to
            withdraw from all Multiemployer Plans to which it (or any of them)
            has contributed or been obligated to contribute, it (and they) would
            incur no material liabilities to such plans under Title IV of ERISA.

                        (B) To the best of Harveys' knowledge, with respect to
            each Multiemployer Plan: (1) no such Multiemployer Plan has been
            terminated or is in reorganization under ERISA so as to result,
            directly or indirectly, in any liability, contingent or otherwise,
            of Harveys or any ERISA Affiliate under Title IV of ERISA; and (2)
            no proceeding has been initiated by any person (including the
            Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) to terminate any Multiemployer
            Plan.

            (iii) WELFARE PLANS. None of Harveys, any ERISA Affiliate or any
Welfare Plan has any present or future obligation to make any payment to, or
with respect to any present or former employee of Harveys or any ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to, any retiree medical benefit plan, or other retiree Welfare Plan,
except to the extent required by the Code or ERISA. Harveys and its ERISA
Affiliates have performed all of their obligations with respect to all
self-funded and self-administered Welfare Plans and have made appropriate
entries in their financial statements for all obligations and liabilities under
such Welfare Plans that have accrued but are not yet due, including without
limitation, reserves for incurred but unreported claims. All required
contributions to, and payments from each Welfare Plan have been made on a timely
basis. No event has occurred and no circumstances exist that could result in a
material increase in premium costs of any Welfare Plans that are insured or in a
material increase in benefit costs of any Welfare Plans that are self-insured.

            (iv) DEDUCTIBILITY OF PAYMENTS. There is no contract, agreement,
plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of Harveys (with
respect to its relationship with such entities) that, individually or
collectively, provides for the payment by


                                       19
<Page>

Harveys of any amount (i) that is not deductible under Section 162 or 404 of the
Code or (ii) that is an "excess parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of
the Code.

            (v) LITIGATION. There is no material action, order, writ,
injunction, judgment or decree outstanding or claim, suit, litigation,
proceeding, arbitral action, governmental audit or investigation, relating to or
seeking benefits under any Employee Plan that or to the best knowledge of
Harveys, is pending against Harveys, any ERISA Affiliate or any Employee Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).

            (vi) NO ACCELERATION OR CREATION OF RIGHTS. Except as provided in
Section 2.1 or disclosed in Section 3.14 of the Harveys Disclosure Schedule
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Harveys nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in the
acceleration or creation of any rights of any current or former employee of
Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries to benefits under any Employee Plan
(including, without limitation, the acceleration of the vesting or
exercisability of any stock options, the acceleration of the vesting of any
restricted stock, the acceleration of the accrual or vesting of any benefits
under any Pension Plan or the acceleration or creation of any rights under any
severance, parachute or change in control agreement).

      Section 3.15 Compliance with Gaming Laws.

      (a) Each of Harveys and its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective
directors (but with respect to non-employee directors, only to Harveys' best
knowledge), officers, persons performing management functions similar to
officers and, to Harveys' best knowledge, partners hold all permits,
registrations, findings of suitability, licenses, variances, exemptions,
certificates of occupancy, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities
(including all authorizations under Harveys Gaming Laws, the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920 and the Shipping Act of 1916 and Certificates of Inspection issued by
the U.S. Coast Guard), necessary to conduct the business and operations of
Harveys and each of its Subsidiaries, each of which is in full force and effect
in all material respects, except for such permits, registrations, findings of
suitability, licenses, variances, exemptions, certificates of occupancy, orders
and approvals the failure of which to hold would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Harveys Material Adverse Effect (the
"Harveys Permits") and no event has occurred which permits, or upon the giving
of notice or passage of time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Harveys Permit that
currently is in effect the loss of which either individually or in the aggregate
would be reasonably likely to have a Harveys Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Harveys and its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors (but with
respect to non-employee directors, only to Harveys' best knowledge), officers,
persons performing management functions similar to officers and, to Harveys'
best knowledge, partners, are in compliance with the terms of the Harveys
Permits, except for such failures to comply, which singly or in the aggregate,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Harveys Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the Harveys SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the businesses of Harveys and its
Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or
regulation of any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any
Harveys Gaming Laws), except for possible violations which individually or in
the aggregate do not and would not be reasonably likely to have a Harveys
Material Adverse Effect. Harveys has received no notice of any


                                       20
<Page>

investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Harveys or
any of its Subsidiaries that is pending, and, to the best knowledge of Harveys,
no investigation or review is threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated any intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have
a Harveys Material Adverse Effect.

      (b) The term "Harveys Gaming Laws" means any Federal, state, local or
foreign statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, permit, consent, registration,
finding of suitability, approval, license, judgment, order, decree, injunction
or other authorization, including any condition or limitation placed thereon,
governing or relating to the current or contemplated casino and gaming
activities and operations and manufacturing and distributing operations of
Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the Nevada
Gaming Control Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
Douglas County, Nevada Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the Iowa Parimutuel Wagering Act, Chapter 99D of the Code of Iowa,
the Riverboat Gambling Act, Chapter 99F of the Code of Iowa and the rules and
regulations of the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission promulgated under Chapters
99D and 99F, the Colorado Division of Gaming and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and any applicable state gaming law and any federal or
state laws relating to currency transactions.

      (c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.15(c) of the Harveys Disclosure
Schedule, neither Harveys nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors (but with respect to non-employee directors, only to
Harveys' best knowledge), officer, key employee or persons performing management
functions similar to officers or, to Harveys' best knowledge, partners of
Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written claim, demand,
notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any Governmental
Entity in the past three years under, or relating to any violation or possible
violation of any Harveys Gaming Laws which did or would be reasonably likely to
result in fines or penalties of $50,000 or more. To Harveys' best knowledge,
there are no facts, which if known to the regulators under the Harveys Gaming
Laws would be reasonably likely to result in the revocation, limitation or
suspension of a license, finding of suitability, registration, permit or
approval of it or them, or of any officer, director, other person performing
management functions similar to an officer or partner, under any Harveys Gaming
Laws. Neither Harveys nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered a suspension or
revocation of any Harveys Permit held under the Harveys Gaming Laws.

      Section 3.16 Information Statement. Neither the Information Statement to
be sent to the stockholders of Harveys in connection with the action taken by
written consent of Harveys' stockholders with respect to approval of "excess
parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (the "Information
Statement"), nor any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, will, as of the
date thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Information Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder in effect as of the filing date thereof; provided,
however, that Harveys makes no representation with respect to any information
supplied or to be supplied by Harrah's for inclusion in the Information
Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto.


                                       21

      Section 3.17 Labor Matters. Except as disclosed in Section 3.17 of the
Harveys Disclosure Schedule or as would not be reasonably likely to have a
Harveys Material Adverse Effect, (i) to the best knowledge of Harveys, there are
no activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any non-unionized
employees; (ii) neither Harveys nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached or
otherwise failed to comply with any provision of any collective bargaining
agreement or contract and there are no grievances outstanding against Harveys or
any of its Subsidiaries under any such agreement or contract; (iii) there are no
unfair labor practice complaints pending against Harveys or any of its
Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board, or any similar foreign
labor relations governmental bodies, or any current union representation
questions involving employees of Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries; and (iv)
there is no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout, or, to the best
knowledge of Harveys, threat thereof, by or with respect to any employees of
Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries. Harveys and its Subsidiaries are not parties
to any collective bargaining agreements.

      Section 3.18 Insurance. Harveys has provided to Harrah's accurate and
complete copies of all material fire and casualty, general liability, business
interruption, product liability, and sprinkler and water damage insurance
policies maintained by Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries. All such insurance
policies are with reputable insurance carriers and provide coverage as is
reasonably prudent to cover normal risks incident to the business of Harveys and
its Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets.

      Section 3.19 Nevada Takeover Statute. As of the date hereof and at all
times on or prior to the Closing, the provisions of Sections 78.378 through
78.3793 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS") are, and shall be,
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      Section 3.20 Brokers. None of Harveys, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the
best knowledge of Harveys, any of their respective officers, directors or
employees have employed any broker, financial advisor or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that Harveys has
retained Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. as its financial
advisors, the arrangements with which have been disclosed to Harrah's prior to,
and will not be modified in a manner adverse to Harrah's subsequent to, the date
of this Agreement.

      Section 3.21 Transactions With Affiliates. Other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and except to the extent disclosed in the Harveys
SEC Reports or as disclosed in Section 3.21 of the Harveys Disclosure Schedule,
from February 2, 1999 through the date of this Agreement, there have been no
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between Harveys or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Harveys' affiliates or other persons,
on the other hand, that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination of
any Harrah's Permit that currently is in effect the loss of which either
individually or in the aggregate would be reasonably likely to have a Harrah's
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Harrah's and its Subsidiaries, and each of
their respective directors (but with respect to non-employee directors, only to
Harrah's' best knowledge), officers, persons performing management functions
similar to officers and, to Harrah's' best knowledge, partners, are in
compliance with the terms of the Harrah's Permits, except for such failures to
comply, which singly or in the aggregate, would not,


                                       26
<Page>

individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Harrah's
Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the forms, reports, and
documents required to be filed by Harrah's with the SEC filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, the businesses of Harrah's and its Subsidiaries are not being
conducted in violation of any Harrah's Gaming Law, except for possible
violations which individually or in the aggregate do not and would not be
reasonably likely to have a Harrah's Material Adverse Effect. Harrah's has
received no notice of any investigation or review by any Governmental Entity
under any Harrah's Gaming Law with respect to Harrah's or any of its
Subsidiaries that is pending, and, to the best knowledge of Harrah's, no
investigation or review is threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated
any intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Harrah's
Material Adverse Effect.

      (b) The term "Harrah's Gaming Laws" means any Federal, state, local or
foreign statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, permit, consent, registration,
finding of suitability, approval, license, judgment, order, decree, injunction
or other authorization, including any condition or limitation placed thereon,
governing or relating to the current or contemplated casino and gaming
activities and operations of Harrah's or any of its Subsidiaries, including,
without limitation, the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Clark County, Nevada Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the Douglas County, Nevada Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Louisiana Economic Development
and Gaming Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
Louisiana Riverboat Economic Gaming Control Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the Illinois Riverboat Gambling Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Mississippi Gaming Control Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the Missouri Riverboat Gambling Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act
of 1988 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, any state-tribal
gaming compact and any applicable state gaming law and any federal or state laws
relating to currency transactions.

      (c) Except as disclosed in Section 5.6(c) of the Harrah's Disclosure
Schedule, neither Harrah's nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director (but
with respect to non-employee directors, only to Harrah's' best knowledge),
officer, key employee or, to Harrah's' best knowledge, partners of Harrah's or
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written claim, demand, notice,
complaint, court order or administrative order from any Governmental Entity in
the past three years under, or relating to any violation or possible violation
of any Harrah's Gaming Laws which did or would be reasonably likely to result in
fines or penalties of $50,000 or more. To Harrah's' best knowledge, there are no
facts, which if known to the regulators under the Harrah's Gaming Laws could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, limitation or suspension of
a license, finding of suitability, registration, permit or approval of it or
them, or of any officer, director, person performing management functions
similar to an officer or partner, under any Harrah's Gaming Laws. Neither
Harrah's nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered a suspension or revocation of
any Harrah's Permit held under the Harrah's Gaming Laws.

                                    COVENANTS

      Section 6.1 Conduct of Business of Harveys. During the period from the
date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth below,
Harveys agrees as to itself and each of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent
that Harrah's shall otherwise consent in writing) to carry on its business in
the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as
previously conducted, to pay its debts and Taxes when due subject to good faith
disputes over such debts or Taxes, to pay or perform its other obligations when
due, and, to the extent consistent with such business, use all reasonable
efforts consistent with past practices and policies to preserve intact its
present business organization, keep available the services of its present
officers and key employees and preserve its relationships with customers,
suppliers, distributors, and others having business dealings with it. Harveys
has delivered concurrently herewith its operating budget (the "Budget"). Harveys
shall make in all material respects the capital expenditures reflected in the
Budget. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, and except as disclosed on Section 6.1 of the
Harveys Disclosure Schedule, during the period from the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Closing, without the written consent of Harrah's, Harveys shall not and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

to acquire any convertible securities or capital stock, or any other securities
in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for, shares of Harveys Common
Stock outstanding on the date hereof or (B) amend, waive or otherwise modify any
of the terms of any employee option, warrant or stock option plan of Harveys or
any of its Subsidiaries, including without limitation, the Options or the
Harveys Stock Option Plan, except that Harveys may make such amendments, waivers
and modifications that (i) will not impair in any respect Harrah's' ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) will not result in any
cost, liability or obligation to Harrah's or any of its Subsidiaries either
before or after Closing or any cost, liability or obligation to Harveys or its
Subsidiaries that adversely affects Harrah's or its Subsidiaries in any respect
whatsoever; provided, however, that Harveys shall be permitted to grant options
and issue stock or restricted stock to employees of Harveys and its
Subsidiaries, so long as such employees accept and agree to the terms of that
certain Stockholders Agreement, dated as of February 2, 1999, by and among
Harveys, Voteco, Colony III, and stockholders party thereto or, in the case of
any employee to be issued stock or restricted stock, such employee executes a
Joinder;

            (iii) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, securities or property or any combination thereof) in respect
of any class or series of its capital stock other than between any wholly-owned

Harveys;

otherwise acquire, or propose to redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire, any
shares of its capital stock, or any of its other securities;

            (v) except as permitted by paragraph (ii) above, increase the

limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of
restricted stock or performance units) or grant any severance or termination pay
to (except pursuant to existing agreements or policies, which shall be
interpreted and implemented in a manner consistent with past practice), or enter
into any employment or severance agreement with, any director, officer or
employee of Harveys or any of its Subsidiaries or establish, adopt, enter into,
or amend any collective bargaining, bonus, profit sharing, thrift, compensation,
stock option, restricted stock, pension, retirement, savings, welfare, deferred
compensation, employment, termination, severance or other employee benefit plan,

directors, officers or current or former employees, including any Benefit

with past practice in connection with Harveys' hotel, casino and related
operations, (2) acquisitions of equipment and other non-current assets in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice in connection with
Harveys' hotel, casino and related operations in an amount individually not to
exceed $250,000 or (3) other acquisitions which, individually, do not exceed

                                       29
<Page>

year which is not terminable within 30 days without cost (other than a de

Federal income tax purposes from those employed in the preparation of its

policies);

            (xiii) enter into any collective bargaining agreement or any

Contracts or waive, release or assign any material rights or claims, except in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice;

            (xvi) take, or agree to commit to take, any action that would make

conditions to Harrah's to consummate the transactions contemplated herein not to
be satisfied;

            (xvii) except for employment arrangements permitted by this
Agreement, engage in any transaction with, or enter into any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding with, directly or indirectly, any of Harveys'
affiliates (other than Harveys' wholly-owned Subsidiaries) which involves the

pursuant to such agreements, arrangements, or understandings existing on the
date of this Agreement;

            (xviii) close, shut down, or otherwise eliminate any of the casinos

Laws), from the date hereof until the Closing, each of Harrah's and Harveys
shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of
the other party to report on the general status of ongoing operations. Each of
Harrah's and Harveys shall promptly notify the other in writing of, and will use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event,
transaction or circumstance, as soon as practical after it becomes known to such
party, that causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Harrah's or
Harveys under this Agreement to be breached in any material respect or that
renders or will render untrue in any material respect any representation or
warranty of Harrah's or Harveys contained in this Agreement. Nothing contained
in Section 6.1 above shall prevent Harveys from giving such notice, using such
efforts or taking any action to cure or curing any such event, transaction or
circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect
on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition contained
herein.

      Section 6.3 No Solicitation.

      (a) Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, Harveys shall not, directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, financial advisor,

of its material Subsidiaries or (b) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of any
class of equity securities of Harveys or any of its material Subsidiaries, or
(c) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Harveys (or any of its
material Subsidiaries) and a third party in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      (b) Harveys shall notify Harrah's immediately after receipt by Harveys (or
any of their advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of such party by any person or entity that informs
such party that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate the identity
of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or
contact.

      Section 6.4 Employee Matters.

      (a) Harveys shall promptly pay or provide when due all compensation and
benefits earned prior to the Closing Date as provided pursuant to the terms of
any Employee Plans in existence as of the date hereof and as otherwise set forth
in Section 3.14(b) of the Harveys Disclosure Schedule for all employees (and
former employees) and directors (and former directors) of Harveys. Harrah's and

compensation and benefits required to be paid pursuant to the terms of any
agreement with any employee, former employee, director or former director in
effect as of the Closing.

      (b) (i) Harveys shall use its reasonable best efforts prior to the Closing
to obtain from each of the Harveys employees that would have amounts payable to
them, or subject to accelerated payments or vesting, under all plans and
agreements which would constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code an agreement in writing to limit amounts payable to
them to those amounts that would be fully deductible pursuant to Section 280G of
the Code unless the stockholders of Harveys approve such amounts pursuant to
Section 280G(B)(5)(B) of the Code (the "Waivers");


                                       32
<Page>

            (ii) Following execution of the Waivers, Harveys shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain written consent pursuant to Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code to the amounts waived pursuant to the Waivers from
stockholders of Harveys owning at least 75% of the outstanding voting stock of
Harveys. Such consent shall by its terms become effective on the 20th calendar
day following mailing of the Information Statement (or such later time as may be
required by the Exchange Act).

      Section 6.5 Written Consent and Information Statement. Following the date
hereof, Harveys shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent
of at least 75% of the voting power of Harveys approving the compensation
arrangements with certain of Harveys' employees, including "excess parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. Harveys shall, as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC
the Information Statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, to be
mailed to all holders of Harveys Class A.

      Section 6.6 Access to Information.

      (a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable law, including without
limitation, antitrust laws and Harveys Gaming Laws, Harveys shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of Harrah's, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period from the date hereof to the Closing, to all its
personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during
such period, Harveys shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to the other (i) copies of monthly financial reports and development
reports, (ii) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal securities laws and (iii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Harrah's may reasonably request. Harrah's
will hold any such information furnished to it by Harveys, which is nonpublic in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement dated November 23,
1999, between Harrah's and Colony Capital LLC, as extended by the letter
agreement dated February 12, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section
6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

      (b) For purposes of complying with Section 1.3(d), the Sellers'
Representative and its officers, directors, managers, member, partners,
employees, financial advisors, legal advisors, accountants, representatives and
agents shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period of any dispute of the amount of Total Transaction Consideration in
Section 1.3(d) following the Closing, to Harveys' and its Subsidiaries'
applicable personnel, properties, books and records and Harveys shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly furnish to the Sellers' Representative and
its officers, managers, members, partners, employees, financial advisors, legal
advisors, accountants, other representatives and agents all information as may
be reasonably required for the purposes specified in Section 1.3(d).

      Section 6.7 Governmental Approvals.

      (a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts (and, with respect to the Harveys Gaming Laws, the
Harrah's Gaming Laws and antitrust laws, if applicable, shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective directors and officers to do
so) to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, registrations, licenses, findings of suitability,
consents, variances, exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, all filings required under the HSR Act, the Harveys Gaming Laws and
the Harrah's Gaming Laws ("Governmental Approvals"), and to comply (and, with
respect to the Harveys Gaming Laws and the Harrah's Gaming Laws, to cause their
respective directors and officers to so comply) with the terms and conditions of
all such Governmental Approvals. The parties hereto and their respective
officers, directors and affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
file within 30 days after the date hereof, and in all events shall file within
60 days after the date hereof, all required initial applications and documents
in connection with obtaining the Governmental Approvals (including without
limitation under applicable Harveys Gaming Laws and Harrah's Gaming Laws) and
shall act reasonably and promptly thereafter in responding to additional
requests in connection therewith. The parties hereto acknowledge that this
Agreement is subject to the review and approval of the Iowa Racing and Gaming
Commission. Harveys and Harrah's shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information (including, without
limitation, antitrust laws and Harveys Gaming Laws), all the information
relating to Harveys or the Harrah's, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders which appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Harveys and Harrah's (the
"Notifying Party") will notify the other promptly of the receipt of comments or
requests from Governmental Entities relating to Governmental Approvals, and will
supply the other with copies of all correspondence between the Notifying Party
or any of its representatives and Governmental Entities with respect to
Governmental Approvals; provided, however, that it shall not be required to
supply the other party with copies of all communication relating to the personal
applications of individual applicants except for evidence of filing.

      (b) Harveys and Harrah's shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which causes such party to reasonably believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such consent or approval from such Governmental Entity will not
be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.
Harveys and Harrah's each shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, seeking to prevent the entry by any
Governmental Entity of any decree, injunction or other order challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions


                                       34
<Page>

contemplated by this Agreement, appealing as promptly as possible any such
decree, injunction or other order and having any such decree, injunction or
other order vacated or reversed.

      (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, Harrah's shall have no obligation or affirmative duty under this
Section 6.7 to dispose of any of its assets or properties, disassociate itself
from any person or entity, or agree to do any of the foregoing at any time in
the future, in connection with seeking any Governmental Approval.

      Section 6.8 Publicity. Harrah's and Harveys shall agree on the form and
content of the initial press release regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereafter shall consult with each other before issuing, provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon and use all reasonable efforts
to agree upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and prior
to considering in good faith any such comments, except as may be required by
applicable law.

      Section 6.9 Indemnification.

      (a) From and after the Closing, Harrah's agrees that it will, and will
cause Harveys to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of Harveys (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that Harveys would have
been permitted under Nevada law, its Articles of Incorporation, its Bylaws and
any indemnification agreements or arrangements in effect on the date hereof to
indemnify such Indemnified Party.

      (b) For a period of six years after the Closing, Harrah's shall maintain
or shall cause Harveys to maintain in effect a directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by
Harveys' directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (copies of which
have been heretofore delivered by Harveys to Harrah's) with coverage in amount
and scope at least as favorable as Harveys' existing coverage; provided that in
no event shall Harrah's or Harveys be required to expend in the aggregate
annually in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Harveys for
such coverage; and if such annual premium would at any time exceed 200% of the
such amount, then Harrah's or Harveys shall maintain insurance policies which
