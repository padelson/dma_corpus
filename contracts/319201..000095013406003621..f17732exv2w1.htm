most recently used for the purpose of funding each International Plan (or, if the same has no such

Sections&nbsp;9.02(c) and 9.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;<B>Merger
Agreement</B>&#148;)<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">1</SUP>, dated as of February&nbsp;22, 2006, among KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), and South
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(&#147;<B>MergerSub</B>&#148;), pursuant to which MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;). The undersigned officer of each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub, hereby certifies and represents that the statements and representations
herein are true, correct and complete at the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at
the Effective Time:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona fide
business purposes not related to taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock was
determined by arm&#146;s length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In
connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for such
stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of

the stockholders of Parent.

representing control of the Company will be exchanged solely for voting stock of
Parent.<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">2</SUP> For purposes of this representation, shares of Company Common Stock redeemed or
disposed of pursuant to the exercise of dissenters&#146; rights under applicable laws or exchanged for
cash or other property furnished, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any affiliate of Parent
shall be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock at the Effective Time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;To the best knowledge of the management of Parent, at the Effective Time, the Company will
not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of rights
pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in the Company that, if exercised or converted,
would affect Parent&#146;s acquisition or retention of control of the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Parent has no plan or intention to cause or permit the Company, after the Effective Time,
to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the
holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock) that would (or if exercised would) result
in Parent losing control of the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to holders of
Company Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The
total amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Company Common Stock instead of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration
that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each holder of Company Common Stock will
be aggregated, and no holder of Company Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares
in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock, except
for any cases in which a holder of Company Common Stock holds beneficial interests in shares of the
Company through more than one account and such multiple accounts cannot be aggregated, either
because the beneficial interest

indirectly, to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative
transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) any of
the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, other than possible repurchases of unvested
shares of employees or consultants in connection with terminations of services or stock repurchases
pursuant to a stock repurchase plan adopted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement by Parent (i)
made in the open market for stock of the Parent which is widely held and publicly traded (except

Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities, options, warrants or

issued by the Company.

of its stock that would result in Parent not being in control of MergerSub at the Effective Time.

or use a significant portion of the Company&#146;s historic business assets in a business. For this
purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group.
If Parent&#146;s Qualified Group owns an interest in a partnership, Parent will be treated as owning a
proportionate share of the Company business assets used in a business of that Partnership. Parent
will be treated as conducting a business of any partnership in which members of Parent&#146;s Qualified
Group own a significant interest and have active and substantial management functions as a partner
with respect to that partnership business. As defined in Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section
1.368-1(d)(iii), a Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock
ownership with Parent but only if Parent is in control of at least one other corporation and each
of the corporations (other than Parent) is controlled directly by one of the other corporations.

securities and eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for
investment (each, an &#147;<B>Investment Company</B>&#148;). For purposes of this representation, in making the 50%
and 80% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i)&nbsp;stock and securities in any subsidiary
corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable
share of the subsidiary&#146;s assets and (ii)&nbsp;a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the

Common Stock to be received by any employee or independent contractor of the Company in the Merger

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter is being delivered in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to
Sections&nbsp;9.02(c) and 9.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;<B>Merger
Agreement</B>&#148;)<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">1</SUP>, dated as of February&nbsp;22, 2006, among KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), and South
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(&#147;<B>MergerSub</B>&#148;), pursuant to which MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;). The undersigned officer of the Company, on behalf of the Company,
hereby certifies and represents that the statements and representations herein are true, correct
and complete at the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The Company&#146;s principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona fide business
purposes not related to taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock was
determined by arm&#146;s length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In
connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for such
stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

Parent Common Stock received by each holder of Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to
the fair market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger, as of the Effective Time, shares of Company Common Stock
representing control of the Company will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent. For
purposes of this representation letter, &#147;control&#148; with respect to a corporation shall mean
ownership of at least (i)&nbsp;80&nbsp;percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
entitled to vote and (ii)&nbsp;80&nbsp;percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of
the corporation. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company Common Stock redeemed or
disposed of pursuant to the exercise of dissenters&#146; rights under applicable laws or exchanged for
cash or other property furnished, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any affiliate of Parent
shall be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock at the Effective Time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;At the Effective Time, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options,
convertible securities, or any other type of rights pursuant to which any Person could acquire
stock in the Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parent&#146;s acquisition or
retention of control of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;The Company has no plan or intention to issue additional shares of stock (or securities,
options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common
Stock) after the Effective Time that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control
of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to holders of
Company Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The
total amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Company Common Stock instead of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration
that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Neither the Company nor any affiliate of the Company has redeemed or will redeem any stock
of the Company prior to and in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger or has made or
will make any distributions with respect to stock of the Company prior to and in connection with or
in contemplation of the Merger.

employees or consultants in connection with terminations of services or stock repurchases pursuant
to a stock repurchase plan adopted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement by Parent (i)&nbsp;made in
the open market for stock of the Parent which is widely held and publicly traded (except that
Parent may acquire stock in block trades made directly with an entity that has represented to
Parent that such entity did not acquire such stock in the Merger) and (ii)&nbsp;limited to, in the

MergerSub&#146;s net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of MergerSub&#146;s gross assets held

the Company to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of dissenters&#146; rights under applicable laws, amounts

any indebtedness of the Company, as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part and
amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the Company to stockholders of the Company (except
for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, will be

Company, Parent will continue the conduct of the Company&#146;s historic business or use a significant
portion of the Company&#146;s historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will be
treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group. If Parent&#146;s Qualified
Group owns an interest in a partnership, Parent will be treated as owning a proportionate share of
the Company business assets used in a business of that Partnership. Parent will be treated as
conducting a business of any partnership in which members of Parent&#146;s Qualified Group own a
significant interest and have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect
to that partnership business. As defined in Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.368-1(d)(iii), a
Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with Parent

Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Merger
Agreement), the Company has not agreed to pay or assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume,
any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Company Common Stock
in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Except as may be provided
in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Merger Agreement), no liabilities of
the Company or, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, the Company stockholders
will be assumed by Parent, and, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, Parent will

subsidiary&#146;s assets, and (ii)&nbsp;a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50%
