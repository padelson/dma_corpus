ARTICLE 2 
 The Merger 

   

 Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law and Massachusetts Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable (and in any event not later than two Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 9, other than conditions that by their 

   ##### 

  

    

nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and will in fact be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger and articles of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State and the Massachusetts Secretary of State, respectively, and make all
other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law and Massachusetts Law
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
(the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger and the articles of
merger are duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and the
Massachusetts Secretary of State in accordance with Delaware Law and
Massachusetts Law. 

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law and Massachusetts Law. 

  

 (d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Sullivan and Worcester LLP, One Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.05 and 2.06, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock represented by the Exchange Ratio (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock as specified in Section 2.06, the "Merger Consideration"); 

  

 (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and 

  

 (d) the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration will have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will have been validly 

   ##### 

  

    

issued and will be fully paid and nonassessable and the issuance thereof will
not be subject to any preemptive or other similar right. 

  

 Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of Parent Common Stock included in such Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.06, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.06 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities. 

  

 Section 2.04 _. Stock Options._ (a) Subject to Section 2.04(b), as of the Effective Time, each stock option outstanding under any stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall cease to represent a
right to acquire Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically
into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock on substantially the
same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as applied to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each assumed Company
Stock Option shall be determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by (B) the Exchange
Ratio (such product to be rounded down to the nearest whole share); and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing (A) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such Company Stock Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option held by a non-employee director or former director of the Company outstanding under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such option an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq (as reported by Bloomberg Financial markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date over (B) the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents from holders of options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or arrangements and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.04, payment may be withheld in respect of any employee stock option until such necessary consents are obtained. 

  

 (d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.04, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the 1933 Act, with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company
Stock Options and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement covering such assumed Company Stock Options (and
to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so
long as such Company Stock Options remain outstanding. Parent shall take all
actions required under the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq with respect
to the assumption by it of the Company Stock Options. It is intended that the
Company Stock Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective
Time as incentive stock options (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) to
the extent the Company Stock Options qualified as incentive stock options
immediately prior to the Effective Time and this Section 2.04 shall be
construed consistent with such intent. 

  

 Section 2.05 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, or any stock dividend thereon (including any dividend of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or any securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock) with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 Section 2.06 _. Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying (i) the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq (as reported by Bloomberg Financial markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled. 

  

 Section 2.07 _. Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the 

   ##### 

  

    

shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 2.08 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2. 

  

ARTICLE 3 
 The Surviving Corporation 

   

 Section 3.01 _. Articles of Organization._ The articles of organization of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.02 _. Bylaws._ The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.03 _. Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE 4

 Except as expressly set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to Section 11.05, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that: 

  

 Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Company has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a 

   ##### 

  

    

Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company
has heretofore delivered or made available (including through the SECs EDGAR
system) to Parent true and complete copies of the articles of organization
and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect. 

  

 Section 4.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company. 

  

 (b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously resolved (subject to Section 6.03) to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation"). 

  

 Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger and the filing of articles of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and the Massachusetts Secretary of State, respectively, and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of laws analogous to the HSR Act, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities laws and (iv) any actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially to impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 4.04 _. Non-Contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the articles of organization or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled, under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (iii) and (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (taking into account for these purposes only the adverse effects specified in clause (ii) of the definition of Material Adverse Effect) or materially to impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.05 _. Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 25,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of February 21, 2006, there were outstanding 14,462,887 shares of Company Common Stock, no shares of Company Preferred Stock and employee stock options to purchase an aggregate of 701,784 shares of Company Common Stock (of which options to purchase an aggregate of 406,430 shares of Company Common Stock were exercisable). All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. No Company Subsidiary owns any shares of capital stock of the Company. Section 4.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list of each outstanding employee stock option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, including the holder, date of grant, exercise price, vesting schedule and number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since February 21, 2006 resulting from the exercise of employee stock options outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into 

   ##### 

  

    

or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the
Company or (iii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or
other obligation of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock
or voting securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii)
being referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. 

  

 Section 4.06 _. Subsidiaries._ (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All active Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation are identified in the Company 10-K. 

  

 (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests). There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary Securities. 

  

 Section 4.07 _. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act._ (a) The Company has delivered or made available (including through the SECs EDGAR system) to Parent (i) the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended April 30, 2005, (ii) its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarters ended 

   ##### 

  

    

July 31, 2005, and October 31, 2005, (iii) its proxy statement relating to the
Companys 2005 annual meeting of stockholders and (iv) all of its other
reports, statements, schedules and registration statements filed with the SEC
since April 30, 2005 (the documents referred to in this Section 4.07(a),
collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). 

  

 (b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be.

There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any International Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such International Plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. According to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used for the purpose of funding each International Plan (or, if the same has no such assumptions and valuations or is unfunded, according to actuarial assumptions and valuations in use by the PBGC on the date hereof), as of February 21, 2006, the total amount or value of the funds available under such Plan to pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such accrued benefits, together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeded the present value of all benefits (actual or contingent) accrued as of such date of all participants and past participants therein in respect of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or would have after the Effective Time any obligation. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates will get the full benefit of any such funds, accruals or reserves.

 (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no penalty has been assessed, and no action, claim, suit, or proceeding is pending (nor is there any investigation of which the Company is aware) or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened by any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the Company or any Subsidiary and relating to or arising out of any Environmental Law; 

   

 (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with all Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits; and

 (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, leases or operates or has, within the past five years, owned, leased or operated any real property in New Jersey or Connecticut. 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Section 4.23, the terms "Company" and "Subsidiaries" shall include any entity that is, in whole or in part, a predecessor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 4.24 _. Antitakeover Statutes._ The Company has taken all action necessary to exempt the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 110D. Neither Massachusetts General Laws Chapters 110D or 110F nor any other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to any such transactions; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes hereof, Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby specifically represent and warrant to the Company that neither of them is an "interested stockholder" in the Company, as such term is defined in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 110F.

would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request
for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries from any Third Party that a Person acting in good
faith would reasonably believe is seeking to make, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the
status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the

   ##### 

  

    

investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Company. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant
to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide access to, or to disclose, any
information to Parent if the Company reasonably determines that such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , however, that the parties will at
Parents request use reasonable efforts to enter into a joint defense or
similar agreement that permits access to such information by Parent while
preserving the attorney-client privilege of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

Tax Matters._ (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any Tax election, change any annual tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting, file any amended Tax Returns or claims for Tax refunds, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any other action, if any such action or omission would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or materially reducing any Tax asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period or portion thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  

 The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter, the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February [21], 2006 (the "Merger Agreement") among the Company, KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and South Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company with the Company to be the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger"). 

  

 As a result of the Merger, the undersigned will receive shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by the undersigned. 

  

 The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent and the Company that, as of the date the undersigned receives any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

 A. The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock in violation of the 1933 Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 B. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for the Company, the requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock acquired in the Merger. 

   ##### 

  

  

 C. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The undersigned has also been advised that, because, at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the shareholders of the Company, the undersigned may be deemed an affiliate of the Company, the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger unless such sale, transfer or other disposition (i) has been registered under the 1933 Act, (ii) is made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, or pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the SEC staff, is otherwise exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. 

  

 D. The undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock acquired in the Merger by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the 1933 Act or to take any other action necessary in order to enable the undersigned to make such sale, transfer or other disposition in compliance with an exemption from such registration. 

  

 E. The undersigned also understands that there will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock acquired in the Merger issued to the undersigned, or on any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN

 SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY 
 THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE 
 DISPOSED OF ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A LETTER 
 AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND KLA-TENCOR 
 CORPORATION, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE 
 PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION" 

   

 F. The undersigned also understands that, unless the transfer by the undersigned of the undersigneds Parent Common Stock acquired in the Merger has been registered under the 1933 Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to the undersigneds transferee: 

   ##### 

  

 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN 
 REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED 
 FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO 
 WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 
 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER 
 WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY 
 DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT 
 OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED 
 OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR 
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION 
 REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933." 

  

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been registered for
sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act or (ii) Parent has received either
an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the undersigned
from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145
under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned. Parent hereby agrees
that, at the request of the undersigned, it will direct its counsel to
deliver such an opinion if, as of the date of such request, the undersigned
is not an affiliate of the Company and all of the other conditions specified
in either Rule 145(d)(2) or Rule 145(d)(3) are satisfied. 

   

 G. The undersigned further understands and agrees that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned set forth herein are for the benefit of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and will be relied upon by such firms and their respective counsel and accountants. 

  

 H. The undersigned understands and agrees that this letter agreement shall apply to all shares of Parent Common Stock acquired in the Merger that are deemed beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights that the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 This letter is being delivered in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement")1, dated as of February 22, 2006, among KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), and South Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerSub"), pursuant to which MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). The undersigned officer of each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub, hereby certifies and represents that the statements and representations herein are true, correct and complete at the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time: 

  

 1. Parents and Merger Subs principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona fide business purposes not related to taxes. 

  

 2. The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock was determined by arms length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for such stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 3. The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock received by each holder of 

 



   

 1 All defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

     ##### 

  

    

Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of
the Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor. 

   

 4. The Parent Common Stock for which Company Common Stock will be exchanged in the Merger will be entitled to vote in the election of directors of Parent and on all other matters put forth to the stockholders of Parent. 

  

 5. Pursuant to the Merger, as of the Effective Time, shares of Company Common Stock representing control of the Company will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent.2 For purposes of this representation, shares of Company Common Stock redeemed or disposed of pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under applicable laws or exchanged for cash or other property furnished, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any affiliate of Parent shall be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock at the Effective Time. 

  

 6. To the best knowledge of the management of Parent, at the Effective Time, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of rights pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in the Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parents acquisition or retention of control of the Company. 

  

 7. Parent has no plan or intention to cause or permit the Company, after the Effective Time, to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock) that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control of the Company. 

  

 8. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to holders of Company Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The total amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Company Common Stock instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each holder of Company Common Stock will be aggregated, and no holder of Company Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock, except for any cases in which a holder of Company Common Stock holds beneficial interests in shares of the Company through more than one account and such multiple accounts cannot be aggregated, either because the beneficial interest 

 



   

 2 For purposes of this representation letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least (i) 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and (ii) 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of the corporation.

     ##### 

  

    

cannot be identified or it would be improper or impracticable to do so, and in
any cases in which the same stockholder owns stock in multiple accounts and
Parent cannot aggregate those accounts through use of their common taxpayer
identification number or EIN or otherwise (in which case no account will
receive more than a fraction of one share in cash). 

   

 9. Neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent has any plan or intention, directly or indirectly, to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) any of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, other than possible repurchases of unvested shares of employees or consultants in connection with terminations of services or stock repurchases pursuant to a stock repurchase plan adopted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement by Parent (i) made in the open market for stock of the Parent which is widely held and publicly traded (except that Parent may acquire stock in block trades made directly with an entity that has represented to Parent that such entity did not acquire such stock in the Merger) and (ii) limited to, in the aggregate, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 10. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former holders of Company Common Stock by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 11. As of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent will own beneficially or of record, or, will have owned beneficially or of record during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities issued by the Company. 

  

 12. Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in control of MergerSub. Parent has no plan or intention to cause MergerSub to, and MergerSub has no plan or intention to, issue additional shares of its stock that would result in Parent not being in control of MergerSub at the Effective Time. 

  

 13. MergerSub is being formed solely to effect the Merger and it will not conduct any business or other activities prior to the Merger. MergerSub will have no liabilities that will be assumed by the Company in the Merger and it will not transfer any assets to the Company in the Merger that are subject to any liabilities. 

  

 14. Immediately after the Effective Time, to the best knowledge of the management of Parent and MergerSub, the Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets and the Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of MergerSubs net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of MergerSubs 

   ##### 

  

    

gross assets held immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of
this representation, amounts paid or incurred by the Company in connection
with the Merger, including amounts used (or to be used) by the Company to pay
Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights
under applicable laws, amounts paid by the Company to stockholders who
receive cash or other property, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company
to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Company, or to repay
any indebtedness of the Company, as part of any overall plan of which
the Merger is a part and amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the
Company to stockholders of the Company (except for regular, normal dividends)
as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, will be treated as
constituting assets of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 15. Following the Merger, Parent will continue the conduct of the Companys historic business or use a significant portion of the Companys historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group. If Parents Qualified Group owns an interest in a partnership, Parent will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the Company business assets used in a business of that Partnership. Parent will be treated as conducting a business of any partnership in which members of Parents Qualified Group own a significant interest and have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership business. As defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(iii), a Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with Parent but only if Parent is in control of at least one other corporation and each of the corporations (other than Parent) is controlled directly by one of the other corporations. 

  

 16. Parent has no plan or intention following the Merger to (i) liquidate the Company, (ii) merge the Company with or into another entity, (iii) sell, exchange, distribute or otherwise dispose of the stock of the Company, except for transfers (including successive transfers) of such stock to one or more corporations controlled by the transferor corporation at the time of such transfer or (iv) permit or cause the Company to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any of its assets, or any of the assets it acquires from MergerSub, except for dispositions in the ordinary course of its business or transfers (including successive transfers) of assets to one or more corporations controlled, in the case of each transfer, by the transferor corporation. 

  

 17. Parent and MergerSub each will pay its or their own expenses, if any, incurred in connection with or as part of the Merger or related transactions. Neither Parent nor MergerSub has paid or will pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by any holder of Company Common Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Neither Parent nor MergerSub has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any other expense or other liability, whether fixed or 

   ##### 

  

    

contingent, of any holder of Company Common Stock, nor will Parent acquire in
the Merger any Company Common Stock subject to any liabilities. 

  

 18. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand. 

  

 19. Neither Parent nor MergerSub is a regulated investment company within the meaning of Section 851 of the Code, a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code or a corporation fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of whose assets are stock and securities and eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for investment (each, an "Investment Company"). For purposes of this representation, in making the 50% and 80% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i) stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiarys assets and (ii) a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding. In determining total assets there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables), government securities and assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of ceasing to be an Investment Company. 

  

 20. None of the compensation received or to be received by any employees or independent contractors of the Company is or will be separate consideration for or allocable to, any of their shares of Company Common Stock to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by any employee or independent contractor of the Company in the Merger is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement. Any compensation paid or to be paid to any stockholder of the Company who will be an employee of or perform services for Parent, the Company or any affiliate thereof after the Merger, will be determined by bargaining at arms length. 

  

 21. The Merger will be carried out in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and none of the material terms and conditions therein has been or will be waived or modified. 

  

 22. There are no agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 23. Neither Parent nor MergerSub will take any position on any federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or with any of the foregoing representations.

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  

 This letter is being delivered in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement")1, dated as of February 22, 2006, among KLA-Tencor Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), ADE Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), and South Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerSub"), pursuant to which MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). The undersigned officer of the Company, on behalf of the Company, hereby certifies and represents that the statements and representations herein are true, correct and complete at the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time: 

  

 1. The Companys principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona fide business purposes not related to taxes. 

  

 2. The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock was determined by arms length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for such stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 



 

       |   |

    1  |   | All defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.  
       ##### 

  

  

EXHIBIT D 

   

 3. The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock received by each holder of Company Common Stock will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor. 

  

 4. Pursuant to the Merger, as of the Effective Time, shares of Company Common Stock representing control of the Company will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent. For purposes of this representation letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least (i) 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and (ii) 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of the corporation. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company Common Stock redeemed or disposed of pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under applicable laws or exchanged for cash or other property furnished, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any affiliate of Parent shall be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock at the Effective Time. 

  

 5. At the Effective Time, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of rights pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in the Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parents acquisition or retention of control of the Company. 

  

 6. The Company has no plan or intention to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock) after the Effective Time that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control of the Company. 

  

 7. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to holders of Company Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The total amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Company Common Stock instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 8. Neither the Company nor any affiliate of the Company has redeemed or will redeem any stock of the Company prior to and in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger or has made or will make any distributions with respect to stock of the Company prior to and in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger. 

  

 9\. To the best knowledge of the management of the Company, neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent has any plan or intention, directly or indirectly, 

   ##### 

  

  

EXHIBIT D 

  

to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative
transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of
an acquisition) any of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger,
other than possible repurchases of unvested shares of employees or
consultants in connection with terminations of services or stock repurchases
pursuant to a stock repurchase plan adopted prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement by Parent (i) made in the open market for stock of the Parent which
is widely held and publicly traded (except that Parent may acquire stock in
block trades made directly with an entity that has represented to Parent that
such entity did not acquire such stock in the Merger) and (ii) limited to, in
the aggregate, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 10. After the Merger, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former holders of Company Common Stock by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 11. To the best knowledge of the management of the Company, as of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or of record during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities issued by the Company. 

  

 12. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets and, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, at least 90% of the fair market value of MergerSubs net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of MergerSubs gross assets held immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid or incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger, including amounts used (or to be used) by the Company to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under applicable laws, amounts paid by the Company to stockholders who receive cash or other property, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Company to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Company, or to repay any indebtedness of the Company, as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part and amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the Company to stockholders of the Company (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, will be treated as constituting assets of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 13\. No assets of the Company have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from continuing the historic business of the 

   ##### 

  

  

EXHIBIT D 

  

Company or from using a significant portion of its historic business assets in
a business following the Merger. Following the Merger, to the best knowledge
of the management of the Company, Parent will continue the conduct of the
Companys historic business or use a significant portion of the Companys
historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will
be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified
Group. If Parents Qualified Group owns an interest in a partnership, Parent
will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the Company business
assets used in a business of that Partnership. Parent will be treated
as conducting a business of any partnership in which members of Parents
Qualified Group own a significant interest and have active and substantial
management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership business.
As defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(iii), a Qualified Group
is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with
Parent but only if Parent is in control of at least one other corporation and
each of the corporations (other than Parent) is controlled directly by one of
the other corporations. 

   

 14. Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement), the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock each will pay its or their own expenses, if any, incurred in connection with or as part of the Merger or related transactions. Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement), the Company has not agreed to pay or assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Company Common Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Except as may be provided in the voting agreements (in form attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement), no liabilities of the Company or, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, the Company stockholders will be assumed by Parent, and, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company, Parent will not acquire in the Merger any Company Common Stock subject to any liabilities. 

  

 15. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand. 

  

 16. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of the Company will equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus (without duplication) the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the Companys assets are subject. 

  

 17. The Company is not a regulated investment company within the meaning of Section 851 of the Code, a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code, or a corporation fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of whose assets are stock and securities and eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for investment (each, an 

   ##### 

  

  

EXHIBIT D 

  

"Investment Company"). For purposes of this representation, in making the 50%
and 80% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i) stock and securities
in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation
shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiarys assets, and (ii)
a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50% or more
of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50%
or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding. In
determining total assets there shall be excluded cash and cash items
(including receivables), government securities, and assets acquired (through
incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of ceasing to be an
Investment Company. 

   

 18. None of the compensation received or to be received by any employees or independent contractors of the Company is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Company Common Stock to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by any employee or independent contractor of the Company in the Merger is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement. Any compensation paid or to be paid to any stockholder of the Company who will be an employee of or perform services for Parent, the Company, or any affiliate thereof after the Merger, will be determined by bargaining at arms length. 

  

 19. The Company is not, and will not be, under the jurisdiction of a court in a "Title 11 or similar case." For purposes of the foregoing, a "Title 11 or similar case" means a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a United States federal or state court. 

  

 20. The Merger will be carried out in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and none of the material terms and conditions therein has been or will be waived or modified. 

  

 21. There are no agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 22. The Company will not take any position on any federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or with any of the foregoing representations. 

  

 23. The undersigned officer is authorized to make all the certifications, representations and covenants on behalf of the Company set forth herein.

 We understand that each of you will rely on this letter in rendering your opinion as to certain United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger. As of the date hereof, we believe that all of the facts, representations and assumptions stated or referred to herein are consistent with the state of facts that will exist as of the Effective Time. We will immediately inform you if, after signing this letter, we have reason to believe that any of the facts described herein, in the Merger Agreement or in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any of the representations made in this letter are or have become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any respect.
