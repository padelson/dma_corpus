(k)all other assets of Seller that are not Acquired Assets.

 

1.04Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this

obligations of Seller and its Affiliates (collectively referred to hereinafter

or relating to, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, including any and
all Transaction Expenses;

 

(b)any and all liabilities arising from the Excluded Assets; and

 

(c)any liabilities for Taxes (i) payable or remittable by Seller or any of its

or Acquired Assets, and whether relating to periods prior to or after the
Closing Date, (ii) allocable to Seller under Section 7.03, or (iii) payable or
remittable by the Company as a result of the Company's status as a current or
former member of any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax group with
Seller or its Affiliates, including under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law (all Taxes
described in this Section 1.04(c), "Excluded Taxes").

 

Seller hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates from and against any and all damages, liabilities, demands, claims,
actions, causes of action, costs, deficiencies, penalties, fines or other
actual losses or out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), that Buyer or its Affiliates may suffer or incur resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Excluded
Liabilities.

 

1.05Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration to be paid for the Acquired
Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall consist of (i) the Cash Payment (subject
to adjustment as provided in this Article I), and (ii) the value of the
Assumed Liabilities.

 

1.06Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") shall take place electronically by the mutual exchange of
facsimile or portable document format (PDF) signatures (a) on the last day of
the month in which satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions set
forth in Article V hereof occurs at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
last day of the month (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to their

 

\- 4 -

 



   

satisfaction at the Closing), (b) at the option of Seller, on December 31,
2020 assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions set
forth in Article V hereof occurs (other than those to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to their satisfaction at the Closing), or (c) on such
other date as is mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller. The date on
which Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date";
provided, however, that the Closing shall not occur prior to (i) November 11,
2020 (the "Inside Date") or (ii) a date prior to the Inside Date that is
specified by Buyer on not less than two (2) Business Days' written notice to
the Company (it being understood that the Closing occurring on such date may
be conditioned on the simultaneous closing of the Debt Financing). If the
Closing occurs, all transactions contemplated herein to occur on or as of the
Closing Date shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously and to be
effective as of 11:59 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Closing Date.

 

1.07Estimated Cash Payment. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an estimate of the Cash Amount,
the Working Capital Surplus, if any, and the Working Capital Deficit, if any,
along with and, based on such estimates, an estimate of the Cash Payment (the
"Estimated Cash Payment"). Seller shall consider in good faith any comments
to the Estimated Cash Payment and the calculations therein delivered by Buyer
and shall deliver an updated Estimated Cash Payment no later than one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date taking into account any comments it
accepts in its discretion, while acting in good faith, which shall be the
definitive Estimated Cash Payment for all purposes hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, agreement on the Estimated Cash Payment is not a condition
to Closing.

 

1.08Closing Payments. At the Closing Buyer shall pay the Estimated Cash
Payment to Seller. All payments pursuant to this Section 1.08 shall be by
wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollars to an account or accounts
specified by Seller.

 

1.09Cash Payment Adjustment.

 

(a)Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer (i) shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement setting forth Buyer's good faith calculation of
(A) the Working Capital (and the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital
Deficit, if any), (B) the Cash Amount, and (C) based on the amounts set forth
in clauses (A) and (B), the Cash Payment (the "Closing Statement"), and (ii)
shall provide access to all records and work papers necessary to compute and
verify the information set forth in the Closing Statement promptly upon
request by Seller. After delivery of the Closing Statement, Seller and its
accountants shall be permitted to make inquiries of Buyer and the Company and
their accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the
Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof. If Seller
has any objections to the Closing Statement, then Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a statement (an "Objection Statement") setting forth its disputes or
objections (the "Objection Disputes") to the Closing Statement and, to the
extent practical, Seller's proposed resolution of each such Objection Dispute.
If an Objection Statement is not delivered to Buyer within forty-five (45)
days after receipt of the Closing Statement by Seller, then the Closing
Statement as originally received by Seller shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the Parties. If an Objection Statement is timely delivered,
then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Objection
Disputes, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Objection Statement, Seller and Buyer shall submit
each unresolved Objection Dispute to BDO USA LLP (the

 

\- 5 -

 



   

"Independent Auditor") to resolve such Objection Disputes. The Independent
Auditor shall be instructed to set forth a procedure to provide for prompt
resolution of any unresolved Objection Disputes (and only such Objection
Disputes) and, in any event, to make its determination in respect of such
Objection Disputes (and only such Objection Disputes) within thirty (30) days
following its retention. The Independent Auditor's determination of such
Objection Disputes shall be final and binding upon the Parties and not subject
to review by a court or other tribunal; provided, however, that no such
determination with respect to any item reflected in the Objection Statement
shall be any more favorable to Buyer than is set forth in the Closing
Statement or any more favorable to Seller than is proposed in the Objection
Statement. Each Party shall pay its own costs, fees and expenses and shall
split equally the costs, fees, and expenses of the Independent Auditor. The
final Closing Statement, however determined pursuant to this Section 1.09(a),
will produce the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any,
and the Cash Amount, in each case to be used to determine the final Cash
Payment. The process set forth in this Section 1.09(a) shall be the exclusive
remedy of the Parties for any disputes related to items required to be
reflected on the Closing Statement or included in the calculation of the
Working Capital and the Cash Amount, whether or not the underlying facts and
circumstances constitute a breach of any representations or warranties.

 

(b)If after the final determination pursuant to clause (a) above, the final
Cash Payment is greater than the Estimated Cash Payment, then Buyer shall
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination thereof) pay to Seller such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller.
If after the final determination pursuant to clause (a) above, the Estimated
Cash Payment is greater than the final Cash Payment, then Seller shall
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination thereof) pay to Buyer such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer. 

 

1.10Preparation of Closing Statement; Cooperation.

 

(a)Preparation of Closing Statement. The Closing Statement (and all
calculations of Working Capital and the Cash Amount) shall be prepared and
calculated in accordance with the same accounting methodologies, principles
and procedures used in, and on a basis consistent with, those applied in
preparing the Year-End Financial Statements (including calculating reserves in
accordance with the same methodology used to calculate such reserves in
preparation of the Year-End Financial Statements), except that the Closing
Statement (and all calculations of Working Capital and the Cash Amount) shall:
(i) not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) be based
on facts and circumstances as they exist prior to the Closing and shall
exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the
Closing; (iii) include general ledger accounts and line items (and only those
general ledger accounts and line items) set forth on Schedule 1.10(a) (the
"Included Current Assets" and "Included Current Liabilities," as applicable);
and (iv) not reflect, directly or indirectly, any additional reserve or
accrual that is not reflected on the Year-End Financial Statements, except
those that: (a) result from material developments occurring after December 31,
2019 that are not listed on Section 3.08 of the Disclosure Schedule, and (b)
would be required to be reflected on the face of a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with the accounting methodologies, principles and procedures used
in, and

 

\- 6 -

 



   

on a basis consistent with, those applied in preparing the Year-End Financial
Statements or, in the event there was no applicable methodology, principle or
procedure used in the preparation of the Year-End Financial Statements, would
be required to be reflected on the face of a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

 

(b)Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company, its subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees,
consultants, accountants and agents to (i) cooperate fully with Buyer and its
accountants and agents in connection with its review of the calculation of the
Estimated Cash Payment (including by providing Buyer with reasonable access to
the employees of the Business who are knowledgeable about the information
contained in, and the preparation of, the calculation of the Estimated Cash
Payment) and (ii) provide any books, records and other information reasonably
requested by Buyer and its accountants in connection therewith. Following the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, employees, consultants, accountants and agents to (i)
cooperate fully with Seller and its accountants and agents in connection with
its review of the Closing Statement and the preparation of the Objection
Statement (including by providing Seller with reasonable access to the
employees of the Business who are knowledgeable about the information
contained in, and the preparation of, the Closing Statement) and (ii) provide
any books, records and other information reasonably requested by Seller and
its accountants in connection therewith or in connection with resolving any
Objection Dispute. 

 

1.11Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree to allocate the
purchase price (as finally determined for applicable U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, taking into account the applicable Assumed Liabilities and any other
amounts to the extent properly taken into account under the Code) among the
Acquired Assets and the assets of the Company in accordance with the
methodologies set forth on Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Allocation"). The
Allocation shall be prepared in accordance with the principles of Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent
applicable. None of Seller or Buyer shall (and Seller and Buyer shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent with the
Allocation on any Tax Return (including but not limited to Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law).

 

1.12Non-Assignment; Consents; Shared Contracts; Enterprise Contracts. 

 

(a)Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
shall not constitute an assignment or an agreement to assign any Contract,
franchise or Permit if the transactions contemplated hereby, including an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of another Person or any
Governmental Authority, would constitute a breach thereof or in any way affect
the rights of Seller or the Company thereunder (such Contracts, franchises or
Permits that are not Affiliate Assignable Contracts, the "Delayed Assets");
provided, however, that to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of any
Delayed Asset or Law, the Parties shall treat Buyer as the owner thereof for
Tax purposes as of the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of
Section 4.15 (Further Assurances), Seller and Buyer shall, for a period of
three (3) months following the Closing, use, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use,

 

\- 7 -

 



   

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, amendments, novations
and waivers and to resolve all impracticalities of assignments, novations or
transfers necessary to convey the Delayed Assets to Buyer following the
Closing Date; provided, however, that none of Seller, Buyer or any other
Person shall be required to offer to make or make any payment to any
counterparty with respect to any Delayed Asset or incur any liability to
secure any such consent, amendment, novation or waiver, other than payments
that Buyer advances to Seller. If such consents, amendments, novations or
waivers are not obtained (or until such consents, amendments, novations and
waivers are obtained), then Seller and Buyer will cooperate in a reasonable
arrangement designed to obtain for Buyer all benefits and privileges of the
applicable Delayed Asset, including by Seller holding such Delayed Asset, as
of and from the Closing, in trust for Buyer, with Buyer performing the
covenants and obligations and liabilities thereunder in Seller's name, with
all benefits and obligations existing thereunder being for Buyer's account;
provided, however, that in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be
required to take any action or enter into any arrangement that would result in
Seller or any its Affiliates incurring additional liabilities or obligations
thereunder.

 

(b)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Enterprise Contracts shall be retained
by Seller or its applicable Affiliate, and are not included in the Acquired
Assets.

 

(c)(i) To the extent any Shared Contract may be split and assigned in part to
Buyer or replicated for the benefit of Buyer pursuant to its terms, without
the consent of the counterparty thereto or other conditions, including the
payment of a transfer or other fee (the "Assignable Shared Contracts"), such
Assignable Shared Contracts shall thereafter be deemed (to the extent of the
split or replication with respect to the portion of such Assignable Shared
Contract that relates exclusively to the Business) to be an Acquired Asset
hereunder and Seller shall split and partially assign to Buyer, or have
replicated for the benefit of Buyer, as of the Closing Date such Contract in
accordance with its terms. (ii) With respect to each Shared Contract that is
not an Assignable Shared Contract and is not an Affiliate Assignable Contract
(the "Non-Assignable Shared Contracts"), each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts from the date hereof until three (3) months after the
Closing Date to cause the counterparty to each such Non-Assignable Shared
Contract to consent to the split and partial assignment or replication of such
Non-Assignable Shared Contract to Buyer (with respect to the portion of such
Non-Assignable Shared Contract that exclusively relates to the Business), or
to otherwise enter into a new Contract with Buyer on substantially the same
terms as exist under the applicable Shared Contract as of the Closing Date.
Each such Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the Parties have received
consent to the split and partial assignment or replication shall thereafter be
deemed (to the extent of the split or replication with respect to the portion
of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract that exclusively relates to the
Business) to be an Acquired Asset hereunder and Seller shall split and
partially assign to Buyer, or have replicated, as of the Closing Date such
Contract in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
and its Affiliates shall not be required to split and partially assign to
Buyer or have replicated any of the Non-Assignable Shared Contracts for which
consent has not been obtained. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of
any transfer or other fee for the split and partial assignment or replication
of such Shared Contract. As to any Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which
the Parties have not received consent as of the Closing, then Seller and Buyer
will cooperate in a reasonable arrangement designed to obtain for Buyer all
benefits and privileges of the portion of the applicable Non-Assignable Shared
Contract

 

\- 8 -

 



   

exclusively relating to the Business, with Buyer performing and assuming the
covenants, obligations and liabilities related thereto in Seller's name;
provided, however, that in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be
required to take any action or enter into any arrangement that would result in
Seller or any its Affiliates incurring additional liabilities or obligations
thereunder.

 

(d)With respect to any (i) Contract where assignment of such Contract to Buyer
without the consent of another Person or any Governmental Authority would
constitute a breach thereof or in any way affect the rights of Seller or the
Company thereunder but where assignment to the Company without the consent of
another Person or any Governmental Authority prior to the Closing would not
constitute such a breach, and (ii) any Shared Contract that may not be split
and assigned in part to Buyer or replicated for the benefit of Buyer but may
be split and assigned in part to the Company prior to the Closing pursuant to
its terms (the "Affiliate Assignable Contracts"), Seller and its Affiliates
shall, prior to the Closing, assign such Contracts to the Company or split
such Shared Contracts and partially assign such portion of the Affiliate
Assignable Contracts that relates to the Business to the Company.

 

(e)So long as Seller satisfies its obligations pursuant to this Section,
Seller shall have no liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating
to the failure to obtain any such consent, amendment, novation or waiver or
the termination of any Delayed Asset or Shared Contract as a result thereof.

 

1.13Withholding. Buyer, or any of its agents, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement any amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under the
Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
and any Ancillary Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, to the extent there are any employee compensatory amounts
subject to payroll reporting and withholding that are payable pursuant to or
as contemplated by this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, such payments
shall be payable in accordance with applicable payroll procedures.

\- 9 -

 



   

hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of
Buyer. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Buyer and, assuming this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Seller, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Buyer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.

 

2.03Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Neither the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Buyer nor the consummation by Buyer of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other comparable governing
documents of Buyer, (b) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or any obligation to
repay) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to
which Buyer is a party or by which any of the properties or assets of Buyer
may be bound, (c) violate any Law applicable to Buyer or by which any of the
properties or assets of Buyer are bound, or (d) require any consent, waiver,
approval, license, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority or third party, except for compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

 

2.04Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Action pending
or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing, against any of Buyer or
its Subsidiaries that (a) involves a claim that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect or (b) seeks injunctive relief and that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material

injunctions or similar orders of any Governmental Authority by which Buyer or

have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

2.05Financing. 

 

(a)Buyer affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its
other obligations under this Agreement that Buyer obtain financing for, or
related to, any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has delivered
to Seller true and complete fully executed copies of the Equity Commitment
Letters to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, equity
financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the "Equity Financing"),
the proceeds which are sufficient to provide Buyer with all funds necessary to
make all payments required to be made by it at the Closing hereunder,
including the Purchase Price and any damages pursuant to Section 9.13(c)
(collectively, the "Required Amount"). The Equity Commitment Letters are not
subject to any conditions to the obligations of the parties thereunder, other
than as set forth therein. The Equity Commitment Letters are valid and
binding on Buyer and, to Buyer's knowledge, each other party thereto, and are
in full force and effect as of the date hereof, and enforceable in accordance
with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally. There are no side letters or other written agreements,
contracts or arrangements to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party
which are related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount

 

\- 10 -

 



   

of the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters to be
funded on the Closing Date other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letters. The Equity Commitment Letters have not been amended or
modified prior to the date hereof, to Buyer's knowledge, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated or pending, and the commitments contained in the
Equity Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in
any respect, and to Buyer's knowledge, no such withdrawal, termination or
rescission is contemplated. All commitments and other fees required to be
paid under the Equity Commitment Letters prior to the date hereof have been
paid, and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller in Article III, Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on
the date hereof that would cause the Equity Commitment Letters to be
ineffective. Assuming no breach or default by Seller under this Agreement and
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 5.01 and 5.03, Buyer
is not aware of the existence of any fact or event as of the date of this
Agreement that would cause the conditions to funding the amount of the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters to be funded on the
Closing Date not to be satisfied.

 

(b)Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each Guarantor has
delivered to Seller its duly executed Limited Guarantee. As of the date

amended or modified and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
applicable Guarantor.

(a)Buyer acknowledges that, (i) it has made its own investigation and analysis
in entering into the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement and any certificates executed in
connection herewith, none of Seller, its Affiliates, nor any other Person on
behalf of the Business, Seller, or its Affiliates, has made any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, expressed or implied, as to
the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Company, or the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Business, the Acquired Assets or
the Company furnished or made available to Buyer and its representatives, or
any other matter related to the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer has not relied on any
representation or warranty from Seller, its Affiliates or any other Person on
behalf of the foregoing in determining to enter into this Agreement, and (iv)
none of Seller, its Affiliates or any other Person acting on their behalf
shall have any liability to Buyer or any other Person with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenue,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations, future cash flows or
the future financial condition of the Business or the future business,
operations or affairs of the Business, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Buyer is knowledgeable about the industry in which the Business
and the Company operate and is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer acknowledges that projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of
future revenue, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations, future
cash flows or the future financial condition of the Business or the future
business, operations or affairs of the Business are inherently uncertain, and
that deviations of results from such projections and similar items that are
made in good faith shall not constitute Fraud.

 

\- 11 -

 



   

(b)Except for the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement and any certificates provided in connection herewith,
(i) the Acquired Assets are being acquired by Buyer AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL
FAULTS, WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING AS TO THE QUALITY,

Affiliates or their respective representatives and no other representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements are being relied upon by Buyer or any of
its representatives or Affiliates.

 

2.07Acquisition of Company Equity Interests for Investment. Buyer is
acquiring the Company Equity Interests for its own account with the present
intention of holding such securities for investment purposes and not with a
view to or for sale in connection with any public distribution of such
securities in violation of any federal or state securities Laws. Buyer is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D of the Securities
Act. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Company Equity Interests may not
be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available under the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws.

 

2.08Brokers' and Finders' Fees. None of Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their
respective directors or employees has employed any investment banker, broker
or finder or incurred any liability for any investment banking fees, brokerage
fees, commissions or finders' fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller or its Affiliates could have
any liability.

 

2.09Solvency. Immediately following the Closing, assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 5.01 and 5.03, Buyer and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be Solvent.

the Antitrust Laws, each of Buyer and Seller shall use its reasonable best

of the other Party, unless such public announcement, release or disclosure is
required by applicable Law (including the rules or regulations of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or any U.S. or non-U.S.

4.07Names Following Closing. Except for the Company IP expressly assigned to
Buyer or as otherwise set forth in the Transition Services Agreement or this
Section 4.07, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company)
shall use, or have the right to use the names, trademarks, service marks,
trade dress, trade names, business names, brand names, slogans, logos,

of Seller or any of its Affiliates including "Allscripts," "Allscripts
Healthcare" or "MDRX" names, or any variations or derivatives thereof, either

prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
4.07 shall restrict Buyer or the Company from referencing Seller in a factual,
non-misleading manner that does not constitute trademark use under applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees that Buyer shall not be
obligated to remove any Retained Marks that may be embedded in Software code
that is included in the Acquired Assets or otherwise licensed pursuant to
Section 4.08(a), provided that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts

hereby grant to the Company and its Affiliates, from and after the Closing
Date, a royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive (with the right to sub-
license consistent with the past practices of the Business), perpetual,
worldwide license to exploit such Intellectual Property, solely in a manner
consistent with past practice, in connection with the continued operations of
the Business, including (with respect to Software) the rights to maintain,
copy, modify, transmit, make derivative works of, store and execute such
Software, in object code and source code form.

 

(b)Subject to Section 4.17, to the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates (for
clarity, excluding Company) used any Software set forth in Schedule 4.08(b)
(which is included in the Acquired Assets) in the ordinary course of business
in the 12-month period prior to Closing ("Acquired Shared Software") Buyer
hereby grants Seller from and after the Closing Date, an irrevocable (except
as expressly set forth herein), perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty free, fully
paid up, worldwide license to exploit such Acquired Shared Software in a
manner consistent with past practice and the natural evolution thereof,
including the rights to maintain, copy, modify, transmit, make derivatives
works of, store, execute, and commercially license and/or host the Acquired
Shared Software and to sublicense such rights to the Acquired Shared Software
to current and future Affiliates of Seller; provided that the Acquired Shared
Software, including any derivative works thereof, (i) shall be used solely as
part of Seller's Care Director product, and (ii) shall not be used in
connection with any product or service (or in connection with the marketing of
any product or service) with functionality similar to the CarePort Software
platforms included in the Acquired Assets. The foregoing license is personal
to Seller and shall not be assigned or

 

\- 32 -

 



   

transferred, including via merger, change of control, or otherwise, except in
connection with a sale of Seller or all or substantially all of its assets.
The foregoing license shall terminate automatically in the event that Seller
uses the Acquired Shared Software or derivative works thereof in violation of
this Section 4.08(b).

 

4.09Retention of Records.

 

(a)Following the Closing, Buyer shall preserve and keep the records held by it
at the Closing Date relating to the Business for a minimum of three (3) years

Law) and make such records and personnel available to Seller as may be
reasonably requested by Seller, not to include disputes or potential disputes
relating to this Agreement, including in connection with any insurance claims
by, legal proceedings against or investigations by any Governmental Authority
of, Seller or to enable Seller to comply with its obligations under applicable
Law, this Agreement, and each Ancillary Agreement. 

 

(b)Following the Closing, Seller shall preserve and keep the records held by
it at the Closing Date relating to the Business for a minimum of three (3)

Agreement, including the Equity Financing, or any cooperation provided
pursuant to Section 4.10, and that Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless

termination thereof.

 

(d)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller
prompt written notice (i) of any actual or alleged breach or default by any
party to any of the Equity Commitment Letters or definitive document related
thereto of which Buyer or its Affiliates becomes aware, if such breach or
default could adversely affect the timely availability or the amount of the
Equity Financing, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication, in each case, from any Equity Financing source alleging any (A)
actual or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation of the

material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Commitment Letters with respect to the obligation to fund the Equity Financing
or the amount of the Equity Financing to be funded prior to or at Closing, in
each case, which would make the funding of the Equity Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Equity Financing) less likely
to occur or materially delay, materially impair or prevent the availability of
all or any portion of the Equity Financing, and (iii) if for any reason Buyer
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion

Company by the Seller prior to Closing and Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
shall make an offer of employment to each such Inactive Business Employee as
of her or her return to active employment; or 

 

(ii)Seller shall cause a newly formed limited liability company, the name and
governing documents of which shall be provided by Buyer (the "New LLC").
Except as otherwise provided under this subsection (ii), immediately preceding
the Closing Date, Seller shall cause New LLC to make an offer of employment to
each Continuing Employee in the United States, which offer shall be for
employment in the same position and for the same compensation and benefits
offered to such Continuing Employee by Seller immediately prior to such
transfer of employment. Each Inactive Business Employee shall not be
transferred to New LLC by the Seller prior to Closing and Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall make an offer of employment to each such Inactive
Business Employee as of her or her return to active employment. In the event
that Buyer elects this alternative set forth in Section 4.16(a)(ii), (1) the
parties shall execute an Employee Leasing Agreement for the Continuing
Employees employed by New LLC and located in the United States to be leased to
the Buyer for purposes of continuing services with the Company, with
supporting processes to be established in good faith by Buyer and Seller prior
to Closing to address management and direction of such employees; and (2)
Seller shall transfer all

 

\- 36 -

 



   

units of the New LLC to Buyer on December 31, 2020, along with any supporting
documentation that may be requested by Buyer and that is consistent with the
scope of Section 4.14.

 

In the case of either alternative under Section 4.16(a)(i) or 4.16(a)(ii)
above, Buyer shall not be required to offer employment to any Business
Employee who has not accepted the Company's or New LLC's offer of employment,
as applicable, to become a Continuing Employee prior to the Employee Closing
Date. Seller shall terminate the employment of any Business Employee who
does not accept an offer to become a Continuing Employee on or before the
Employee Closing Date.

 

(b)Seller shall retain the Continuing Employees in India and provide their
services to Buyer as part of the Transition Services Agreement or other
similar services agreement as advisable under local law (the "India Employee
Services Agreement"), as contemplated therein and with supporting processes to
be established in good faith by Buyer and Seller prior to Closing to address
management and direction of such employees. Buyer shall cause an affiliate or
third party vendor to make offers to such employees at least ten (10) days
prior to termination of the related services set forth in the India Employee
Services Agreement, and Seller or its Affiliates shall terminate any such
Continuing Employees who have not accepted such offers prior to the
termination of such services.

 

(c)For a period ending on the earlier of (i) the 12-month period following the
Closing Date or (ii) on the date on which a Continuing Employee ceases to be
employed (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the
Company to provide, to each Continuing Employee a base salary or hourly wage
rate, as applicable, that is at least equal to the base wage rate or salary
provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.
In addition, during the Continuation Period, Buyer shall provide benefits
(excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, equity
or equity-based, severance and post-termination or retiree health or welfare
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
(excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, equity
or equity-based, severance and post-termination or retiree health or welfare
benefits) provided by Seller under the Benefit Plans in effect immediately
prior to the date hereof. Buyer agrees to waive any limitations regarding
preexisting conditions, and to give full credit for any co-payments made and
deductibles fully or partially satisfied prior to the Closing Date with
respect to the Benefit Plans or under any welfare or other employee benefit
plans adopted or maintained by Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates
on or after the Closing Date. Buyer agrees to recognize all service of each
Continuing Employee for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
credit, and entitlement to benefits in any applicable Benefit Plans to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any applicable welfare or other employee benefit
plans adopted or maintained by Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates
on or after the Closing Date, in each case that constitute bonus or incentive
plans in which such Continuing Employee was be eligible to participate prior
to Closing; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. This Section 4.16(a) shall be binding
and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this
Section 4.16(a), express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
4.16(a). Nothing contained herein, express or

 

\- 37 -

 



   

implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
terms set forth in this Section 4.16 shall not create any right in any
employee or any other Person to any continued employment with any of Seller,
the Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 

(d)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.16 of this Agreement and to the
extent permitted under applicable Law, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall
take any action to terminate the employment of any Inactive Business Employee
until the earlier of (i) the date that is twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date (except where required otherwise by applicable Law), (ii) the
date when such Inactive Business Employee returns to active employment, and
(iii) the date on which such Inactive Business Employee exhausts his or her
maximum period of leave under Seller policies or applicable Law. Buyer, the
Company or an Affiliate or Buyer shall offer employment to each Inactive
Business Employee upon his or her return to active employment, so long as such
Inactive Business Employee returns to active employment within twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date (or such longer period required by
applicable Law), and each such Inactive Business Employee shall become a
Continuing Employee only upon their commencement of active employment with
Buyer, the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer. Seller agrees to promptly
notify, or cause its applicable Affiliate to notify, Buyer upon receiving
notice of an Inactive Business Employee's pending return to work or upon an
Inactive Business Employee's exhaustion of leave under Seller policies.

 

(e)During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall honor in accordance with their
terms all severance arrangements between Seller, on the one hand, and the
Continuing Employees, on the other hand, in effect prior to the Closing Date,
as well as all applicable Laws relating to the termination and severance of
employment. The requirements of this subsection (e) shall furthermore apply to
any Business Employee who is not extended an offer to become a Continuing
Employee at Buyer's request, and as a result such Business Employee becomes
eligible to be paid severance under the Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.
Severance Plan dated as of May 20, 2013, as amended, or to be paid statutorily
required severance for those Business Employees located in India, due to
Seller's involuntary termination of such individual at or immediately prior to
the Employee Closing Date.

 

(f)Seller and Buyer agree that they will utilize, or cause their respective
Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in IRS Revenue
Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting relating to Business
Employees.

 

(g)The Company or New LLC, as applicable, shall cease to be a participating
employer in the Benefit Plans as of the Employee Closing Date and the
Continuing Employees that are employed by the Company or New LLC, as
applicable, as of the Employee Closing Date shall cease to be active
participants in the Benefit Plans, except as provided in the applicable
Benefit Plan or under applicable Law. 

 

(h)Effective as of the Employee Closing Date, contributions under the Seller's
defined contribution plan in respect of the Continuing Employees who
participated in such plan shall cease, and the account balances of all such
Continuing Employees shall be 100% vested. Effective as of the Employee
Closing Date, or soon as practicable thereafter, Buyer shall

 

\- 38 -

 



   

establish or make available a 401(k) plan for the benefit of the Continuing
Employees, which plan will accept, subject to and to the extent permitted by
the terms of the tax-qualified 401(k) plan designated by Buyer and the terms
of Seller's tax-qualified 401(k) plan in which such Continuing Employees
participate, rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, and including a plan
loan of such employee) from the Seller's defined contribution plan to such
tax-qualified 401(k) plan designated by Buyer.

 

4.17Restrictive Covenants. 

 

(a)From and after the Closing until the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Restricted Period"), Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates

Business; or (ii) seek to persuade any such Business Partner, or any
prospective Business Partner, of the Business who has been such at any time
within the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the Closing Date, to

Business.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.17, Seller and
its Affiliates shall not be prohibited from: (i) advertising job openings by

the Business), (ii) hiring, or soliciting any Business Employee or independent

activities, that provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its
enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law.
