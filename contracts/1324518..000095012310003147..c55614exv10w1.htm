by Williams, such representation in clause (ii) applies only to the
Transferred Businesses and the Transferred Assets.

are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its officers have
received notice from any governmental authority questioning or challenging
the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such

"Associated Employees") are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Except as would not result in any liability to the Partnership Parties or the

are no facts or circumstances that have resulted or would reasonably be
expected to result in a claim on behalf of an individual or a class in excess
of $3,750,000 for unlawful discrimination, unpaid overtime or any other
violation of state or federal laws relating to employment of the Associated
Employees.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | As of the Closing Date, except with respect to the
Services Agreements, none of the Contributed Entities will sponsor, maintain
or contribute to, or have any legal or equitable obligation to establish,
any compensation or benefit plan, agreement, program or policy (whether
written or oral, formal or informal) for the benefit of any present or former
directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants or other similar
representatives, including, but not limited to, any "employee benefit plan"
as defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA") (the foregoing are hereinafter collectively
referred to as "Plans").  
      
    | (c)  |   | Except as would not result in any liability to the
Partnership Parties or the Contributed Entities, (i) each Plan in which
Associated Employees participate and that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is and has been so qualified in form, and (ii)
each Plan in which Associated Employees participate is and has been operated
and maintained in material compliance with its terms and the provisions of
all Applicable Laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation,

any entity treated as a single employer with a Contributing Party for
purposes of Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA (the
"Contributing Parties  
    

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | Aggregated Group")) has maintained within the last
six years or has had any obligation to contribute to within the past six
years, (i) except for an event described in Section 4043(c)(3) of ERISA and
except for an event that would not impose any liability on the Partnership
Parties or the Contributed Entities, there has been no "reportable event," as
that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived, and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in such a "reportable event" for which a waiver
does not apply, (ii) none of the Contributed Entities, the Contributing
Parties or any member of the Contributing Parties Aggregated Group has
incurred any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA other than
liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation that have
been timely paid and other than any liabilities for which the Contributed
Entities have no direct or indirect responsibility or obligation and (iii)
there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived that,
in either case, would give rise to a Lien on any of the Transferred Assets or
that would reasonably be expected to result in a Transferred Businesses
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Contributed Entities, the Contributing
Parties or any member of the Contributing Parties Aggregated Group
contributes to, or has an obligation to contribute to, and has not within six
years prior to the Closing Date contributed to, or had an obligation to
contribute to, a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA (x) that is, or is reasonably expected to be in "critical" or
"endangered" status as defined in Section 432 of the Code or Section 305 of
ERISA, or (y) in respect of which a Contributed Entity, Contributing Party or
any member of the Contributing Parties Aggregated Group has or may reasonably
be expected to incur any withdrawal liability (as defined in Section 4201 of
ERISA).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities
under each of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than
multiemployer plans) (the "Title IV Plans"), determined as of the end of such
Title IV Plans most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Title IV Plans most
recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value
of the assets of such Title IV Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.
The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in section 4001
of ERISA and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the
meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.  
      
    | (f)  |   | Except as would not result in any liability to a
Contributed Entity (other than with respect to liability of a Contributed
Entity arising from it being a party to a Services Agreement), the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any subsequent  
    

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | employment-related event) result in any payment
becoming due, result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefits, result in the incurrence or acceleration of any other
obligation related to the Plans or to any employee or former employee of the
Contributing Parties or any of their Affiliates.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (g)  |   | All costs and liabilities associated with Associated

Contributing Parties and their Affiliates and the Contributed Entities.  
   

  

3.17 _Labor Matters_. 

  

There is no labor strike, or other material dispute, slowdown or stoppage
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Contributing Parties, threatened against
any Contributing Party, Contributed Entity or Williams with respect to any
employee that will be providing services in connection with the Transferred
Businesses and the Transferred Assets.

Except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement or as set forth on
_Disclosure Schedule 3.18_ , none of the Contributed Entities is party to,
and immediately after Closing will not be party to, any agreement, contract
or arrangement between such Contributed Entity, on the one hand, and any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, other than (a) those entered into in the
ordinary course of business relating to the provision of natural gas
gathering, processing, treating, transportation and storage services and NGL
marketing services or for the purchase of power, the purchase or sale of
natural gas for fuel or system requirements or the purchase or sale of
liquid products, in each case, on commercially reasonable terms and (b) those
entered into for purposes of hedging future anticipated purchases or sales of
commodities as authorized under the Williams Midstream Commodity Transaction
Policy.

insurance policies underwritten by reputable insurers that include coverages
and related limits and deductibles that are customary in the natural gas
gathering, processing, treating, transportation and storage industries and
NGL marketing industry and consistent with past practice. All such insurance
policies are, and after Closing will continue, in full force and effect and
all premiums due and payable on such policies have been paid. No notice of
cancellation of, or indication of an intention not to renew, any
such insurance policy has been received by any Contributing Party other than
in the ordinary course of business. 

   

3.20 _Intellectual Property Rights._  

  

Each Contributed Entity owns or has the right to use all Intellectual Property
necessary for or used in the conduct of its business as currently conducted
by the Transferred Businesses, and their products and services do not
infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate any 

  ##### 

  

   

Intellectual Property of any third party. All Intellectual Property owned by
any Contributed Entity is free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens). Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, with or
without notice or lapse of time, result in, or give any other Person the
right or option to cause or declare, a breach or termination of, or
cancellation or reduction in rights of any Contributed Entity under any
contract providing for the license of any Intellectual Property to
such Contributed Entity, except for any such terminations, cancellations or
reductions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Transferred Businesses Material Adverse Effect. There is no Intellectual
Property-related action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, notice or
complaint pending or threatened, by any third party before any court or
tribunal (including, without limitation, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) relating to
the Transferred Businesses, the Transferred Assets or the
Contributed Entities operations relating thereto, nor has any claim or
demand been made by any third party that alleges any infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual Property of any third
party, or unfair competition or trade practices by any of the Contributed
Entities. Except as would not result in a Transferred Businesses Material
Adverse Effect, the Contributed Operating Entities have taken reasonable
measures to protect the confidentiality of all material trade secrets. 

   

3.21 _Investment Company Act_.

nor immediately after the Closing will be, subject to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

indirectly) into any agreement with any Person that would obligate the

the CCA Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except
as set forth on  _Disclosure Schedule 3.22_. 

   

3.23 _Liabilities Associated with Natural Gas Contracts_. 

  

There has been no misallocation, calculation error, measurement problem or
similar event relating to the performance by the Contributed Entities under
any natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transportation or storage
contract or NGL marketing contract that would give rise to a correcting
adjustment under any such contract that would reasonably be expected to result
in a liability to the Partnership Parties in excess of $37,500,000. 

   

3.24 _Books and Records_. 

  

Accurate copies of the respective books of account, minute books, stock or
other equity record books of each Contributing Party and each Contributed
Entity have been made available for inspection to the Partnership Parties. 

    ##### 

  

     

3.25 _Investment Intent_. 

  

The Contributing Parties have substantial experience in analyzing and
investing in entities like the Partnership and are capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of their investment in the Partnership. The Contributing
Parties are acquiring the Equity Consideration solely for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with,
any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or state
securities laws. The Contributing Parties acknowledge that the Equity
Consideration will not be registered under the Securities Act or
any applicable state securities law, and that such Equity Consideration may
not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of
the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and
pursuant to state securities laws and regulations as applicable.
The Contributing Parties acknowledge that each certificate representing the
Equity Consideration shall bear a legend in substantially the following
form: 

  

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF WILLIAMS PARTNERS

subsidiaries harmless from the Applicable Ownership Percentage of Taxes,

expenses of investigation and attorneys and accountants fees and expenses,
arising out of or incident to the determination, assessment or collection of
such Taxes ("Tax Losses"), (i) imposed on or incurred by the Contributed
Entities or the Transferred Assets by reason of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law or regulation which is
attributable to having been a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary
group on or prior to and including the Closing Date, (ii) any Tax Losses

    | (b)  |   | by the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, or

other rights and remedies that the terminating party or its Affiliates may
have (provided the terminating party and its Affiliates are not otherwise
in material default or breach of this Agreement, or have not failed or
refused to close without justification hereunder), if the other party has
breached or failed to perform in any respect any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein and such breach or
failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
specified in _Article 6_ , (ii) cannot be cured or has not been cured within
ten (10) days following delivery of written notice from the non-defaulting
party of such breach of this Agreement and (iii) has not been waived by the
non-defaulting party;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | by the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, or
the Contributing Parties, on the other hand, in writing, without liability,
if there shall be any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Authority binding on any of the parties, which prohibits or
restrains them from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby,
provided that the parties shall have used their commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such order, writ, injunction or decree lifted and the
same shall not have been lifted within thirty (30) day after entry by any
such Governmental Authority;  
      
    | (e)  |   | by the Contributing Parties if any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.2_ have become incapable of fulfillment, and have
not been waived in writing by the Contributing Parties; or  
      
    | (f)  |   | by the Partnership Parties if any of the conditions set

If a party terminates this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_ above, such
termination shall be without liability and none of the provisions of this
Agreement shall remain effective or enforceable, except for those contained
in this _Section 8.2_ and _Article 10_. Notwithstanding and in addition to
the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ or if any party is otherwise in breach of this Agreement,
(a) such breaching party or parties shall remain liable for its or their
obligations under _Article 7_ and/or _Article 9_, and (b) such termination
shall not relieve such breaching party of any liability for a willful breach
of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement or be deemed a waiver of
any available remedy (including specific performance, if available) for any
such breach. 

       ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE 9 
 INDEMNIFICATION UPON CLOSING 

  

9.1 _Indemnification of the Partnership Parties_. 

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Contributing
Parties, from and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold
the Partnership Parties, their subsidiaries (including the Contributed
Entities) and their respective securityholders, directors, officers,
and employees, and the officers, directors and employees of the General
Partner, but otherwise excluding any of the Contributing Parties and their
Affiliates (the "Partnership Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against
any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any Partnership Indemnified Party
as a result of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of the Contributing Parties in this Agreement or
any Contributing Parties Closing Document, (ii) any breach of any agreement
or covenant on the part of the Contributing Parties made under this Agreement
or any Contributing Parties Closing Document or in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, or (iii) any breach or
violation of any Environmental Laws by the Contributed Entities or relating
to the Transferred Assets that occurs prior to Closing. For purposes of this
Section 9.1, whether the Contributing Parties have breached any of their
representations and warranties herein shall be determined without giving
effect to any qualification as to "materiality" (including the word
"material" or "Transferred Businesses Material Adverse Effect"). Furthermore,
for purposes of this _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.11_ , the Contributing
Parties Closing Documents shall be deemed to exclude all Ancillary Agreements
other than the CCA Agreement. 

  

9.2 _Indemnification of the Contributing Parties_. 

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Partnership
Parties shall indemnify, defend and hold the Contributing Parties, their
Affiliates (other than any of the Partnership Indemnified Parties) and their
respective securityholders, directors, officers, and employees
(the "Contributing Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and
all Damages suffered or incurred by the Contributing Indemnified Parties as a
result of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of the Partnership Parties in this Agreement or any Partnership
Parties Closing Document or (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant on
the part of the Partnership Parties made under this Agreement or any
Partnership Parties Closing Document or in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. For purposes of this Section 9.2, whether the
Partnership Parties have breached any of their representations and warranties
herein shall be determined without giving effect to any qualification as to
"materiality" (including the word "material" or "Partnership Material Adverse
Effect"). Furthermore, for purposes of this  _Section 9.2_ and _Section
9.11_, the Partnership Parties Closing Documents shall be deemed to exclude
all Ancillary Agreements other than the CCA Agreement. 

  

9.3 _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

With the exception of a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Contributing Parties contained in _Section 3.11_, nothing
in this _Article 9_ shall apply to liability with respect to Taxes, the
liability with respect to which shall be as set forth in _Article 7_. 

       ##### 

  

    

9.4 _Survival_. 

  

All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
party hereto, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Articles 3_ and _4_ and in any certificate delivered in connection herewith
with respect to any of those representations and warranties shall terminate
and expire on the first day of the 18th month following the month in which
Closing occurs, except (a) the representations and warranties of the
Contributing Parties set forth in _Section 3.11_ shall survive until 30 days
after the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including all
periods of extension and tolling), (b) the representations and warranties of
the Contributing Parties set forth in _Section 3.7_, _Section 3.12_ and
_Section 3.16_ shall terminate and expire on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, (c) the representations and warranties of the Contributing
Parties set forth in _Section 3.1_,  _Section 3.2_ and _Section 3.4_ shall
survive forever and (d) the representations and warranties of the Partnership
Parties set forth in _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.2_ shall survive forever.
After a representation and warranty has terminated and expired,
no indemnification shall or may be sought pursuant to this _Article 9_ on
the basis of that representation and warranty by any Person who would have
been entitled pursuant to this _Article 9_ to indemnification on the basis of
that representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration,
provided that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall
terminate and expire as provided in this _Section 9.4_, no claim presented
in writing for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ on the basis of
that representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration
shall be affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The
indemnification obligations under this _Article 9_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall apply regardless of whether any suit or action results
solely or in part from the active, passive or concurrent negligence or strict
liability of the indemnified party. The covenants and agreements entered into
pursuant to this Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive
the Closing. 

  

9.5 _Demands_. 

  

Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its discovery of
facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim,
action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such claims
for indemnity involving third party claims being collectively referred to
herein as the "Indemnity Claim"), with respect to any matter as to which it
claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it
will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party,
together with a statement of such information respecting any of the
foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a formal demand for
indemnification under this Agreement. 

  

If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient
time to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend against an
Indemnity Claim and to make a timely response thereto, the indemnifying
partys indemnity obligation relating to such Indemnity Claim shall be limited
to the extent that such failure has actually prejudiced or damaged the
indemnifying party with respect to that Indemnity Claim. 

       ##### 

  

    

9.6 _Right to Contest and Defend_. 

  

The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to contest
and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim for which
it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that notice of the intention to so contest shall
be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party within twenty
(20) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the
indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest
may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying party or the
indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by
reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not reasonably
objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party shall have
the right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be
represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. 

  

The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action to be
taken with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying
party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified party to any
obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks
or obligations not involving material expense or injunctive relief. If the
indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim, the
indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto
by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of an
Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party may
recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, which
releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such
Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the
indemnified party as determined by the indemnified party in its sole
discretion. 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in
defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for
money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense
of the portion relating to money damages. 

  

9.7 _Cooperation_. 

  

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any
Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting
the Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim. 

       ##### 

  

    

9.8 _Right to Participate_. 

  

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim
against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or
counsel for such Persons. 

  

9.9 _Payment of Damages_. 

  

The indemnification required hereunder in respect of Indemnity Claims shall be
made by periodic payments of the amount of Damages in connection therewith,
within ten (10) days as and when reasonably specific bills are received by,
or Damages are incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered to, the
indemnifying party. In calculating any amount to be paid by an
indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, the amount
shall be reduced by all insurance proceeds and any indemnification
reimbursement proceeds received from third parties credited to or received by
the indemnified party related to the Damages. 

  

9.10 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | To the extent that the Partnership Indemnified
Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant
to _Section 9.1_ , the Contributing Parties shall be liable only if (i) the
Damages with respect to a claim exceed $400,000 (the "Minimum Claim Amount")
and (ii) the Damages for all claims that exceed the Minimum Claim Amount
exceed, in the aggregate, $180,000,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), and then
the Contributing Parties shall be liable only for Damages to the extent of
any excess over the Deductible Amount. In no event shall the Contributing
Parties aggregate liability to the Partnership Indemnified Parties under
_Section 9.1_ exceed $1,440,000,000 (the "Ceiling Amount"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the Deductible Amount shall not apply to breaches or
inaccuracies of representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_,
_Section 3.2_ , _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.22_ and _Section 3.23_ and (ii)
the Ceiling Amount shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies
of representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.4_; _provided_ ,
that the Contributing Parties aggregate liability for a breach or inaccuracy
of such _Section 3.4_ shall not exceed an amount equal to
$9,500,000,000 minus the amount of all other Damages payable by the
Contributing Parties hereunder.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | To the extent the Contributing Indemnified
Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant
to _Section 9.2_ , the Partnership Parties shall be liable only if (i) the
Damages with respect to a claim exceed the Minimum Claim Amount and (ii) the
Damages for all claims that exceed the Minimum Claim Amount exceed, in the
aggregate, the Deductible Amount, and then the Partnership Parties shall be
liable only for Damages to the extent of any excess over the Deductible
Amount. In no event shall the Partnership Parties aggregate liability to
the  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Contributing Indemnified Parties under _Section 9.2_
exceed the Ceiling Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible
Amount shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.4_.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | Additionally, neither the Partnership Parties, on
the one hand, nor the Contributing Parties, on the other hand, will be liable
as an indemnitor under this Agreement for any consequential, incidental,
special, indirect or exemplary damages suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party or parties except to the extent resulting pursuant to
Indemnity Claims.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

9.11 _Limited Williams Guarantee_. 

  

For so long as the Contributing Parties have an indemnification obligation
pursuant to this  _Article 9_, Williams absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the payment of any and all Damages owed to a
Partnership Indemnified Party by the Contributing Parties to the extent that
the Contributing Parties do not fulfill their obligations under this _Article
9_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Williams
total aggregate potential liability with respect to this _Section 9.11_
shall be $1,440,000,000. 

  

9.12 _Sole Remedy_. 

  

Should the Closing occur, no party shall have liability under this Agreement,
any of the Closing Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby except as is provided in _Article 7_ or this _Article 9_ (other than
claims or causes of action arising from intentional fraud).

10.6 _Conflicting Provisions_. 

  

This Agreement and the Closing Documents, read as a whole, set forth the
parties rights, responsibilities and liabilities with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the Agreement and the Closing
Documents, and as between them, specific provisions prevail over general

hereto without the prior written consent of each other party. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person or entity

Any such Debt Obligation Net Losses will be allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(iii).

 3. Section 4.8(c) is hereby amended to add the following sentence to the end of Section 4.8(c): 

  

 "The transfer of a Class C Unit that has converted into a Common Unit shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by Section 6.10." 

   ##### 

  

  

 4. Section 5.2 is hereby amended to add a new Section 5.2(e) as follows: 

  

 "(e) Each payment by Williams or an Affiliate of Williams in satisfaction of all or any portion of the Quarterly Devils Tower Payment shall be treated as a Capital Contribution to the Partnership by the General Partner in the amount of such payment." 

  

 5. Section 5.5(c) is hereby amended to add a new Section 5.5(c)(iii) as follows: 

  

 "(iii) Subject to Section 6.10, immediately prior to the transfer of a Class C Unit or of a Class C Unit that has converted into a Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.12(f) by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this subparagraph 5.5(c)(iii) apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its Class C Units or converted Class C Units will (A) _first_ , be allocated to the Class C Units or converted Class C Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Class C Units or converted Class C Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) _second_ , any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any Class C Units or converted Class C Units. Following any such allocation, the transferors Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Class C Units or retained converted Class C Units, if any, will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the transferees Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Class C Units or converted Class C Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (A) hereinabove." 

  

 6. Article V is hereby amended to add a new Section 5.12 creating a new class of Units as follows: 

  

 "Section 5.12 Establishment of Class C Units. 

  

 (a) _General_. The General Partner hereby designates and creates a class of Units to be designated as "Class C Units" and consisting of a total of 203,000,000 Class C Units, and fixes the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties of holders of the Class C Units as set forth in this Section 5.12. 

  

 (b) _Rights of Class C Units_. During the period commencing upon issuance of the Class C Units and ending on the Class C Conversion Effective Date: 

  

 (i) _Allocations_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated to the Class C Units to the same extent as such items would be so allocated if such Class C Units were Common Units that were then Outstanding. 

  

 (ii) _Distributions_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Class C Units shall have the right to share in partnership distributions of Available Cash pursuant to Section 6.3 on a pro rata basis with the Common Units (excluding distributions with respect to (A) the calendar quarter in which the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs and (B) the calendar quarter prior to the calendar quarter in which the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs), so that the 

   ##### 

  

 

amount of any Partnership distribution to each Common Unit will equal the
amount of such distribution to each Class C Unit. The Class C Units shall
have the right to share in Partnership distributions of Available Cash
pursuant to Section 6.3 with respect to the calendar quarter in which the
closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement
occurs, so that the amount of any Partnership distribution to each Class C
Unit will equal (A) the amount of such distribution to each Common Unit
multiplied by (B) a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of
days commencing with the first day of the month in which the closing of
the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs and
ending with the last day of such calendar quarter and (y) the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such calendar quarter. In the event that
the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution
Agreement occurs prior to or on the record date for a distribution by the
Partnership of Available Cash pursuant to Section 6.3 with respect to a
calendar quarter prior to the calendar quarter in which the Closing of the
contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs, the
Class C Units shall have no right to share in distributions of Available Cash
with respect to such prior calendar quarter. 

   

 (c) _Voting Rights_. Prior to the Class C Conversion Effective Date, the Class C Units shall be entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of the Common Units on any matters on which Unitholders are entitled to vote, and shall be entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter that adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Class C Units in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests (including as a result of a merger or consolidation) or as required by law. The approval of a majority of the Class C Units shall be required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Class C Units are entitled to vote as a separate class. Each Class C Unit will be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of Common Units into which a Class C Unit is convertible at the time of the record date for the vote or written consent on the matter. 

  

 (d) _Certificates_. The Class C Units will be evidenced by certificates in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ to Amendment No. 6 to this Agreement and, subject to Section 6.10 and the satisfaction of any applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may be assigned or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of Common Units. The certificates will initially include a restrictive legend to the effect that the Class C Units have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. 

  

 (e) _Registrar and Transfer Agent_. The General Partner will act as registrar and transfer agent of the Class C Units. 

  

 (f) _Conversion_. Each Class C Unit shall automatically convert into one Common Unit (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any split-up, combination or similar event affecting the Common Units or other Units that occurs prior to the conversion of the Class C Units) effective as of the first business day following the record date for the distribution with respect to the calendar quarter in which the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs (the " _Class C Conversion Effective Date_") without any further action by the holders thereof and without the approval of any Partner. The terms of the Class C Units will be changed, automatically and without further action, on the Class C Conversion Effective Date so that each Class C Unit is converted into one Common Unit and, immediately thereafter, none of the Class C Units shall be Outstanding; _provided, however_ , that 

   ##### 

  

 

such converted Class C Units will remain subject to the provisions of Sections
6.1(d)(xv) and 6.10. 

   

 (g) _Surrender of Certificates_. Subject to the requirements of Section 6.10, on or after the Class C Conversion Effective Date, each holder of Class C Units shall promptly surrender the Class C Unit Certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the General Partner or of any transfer agent for the Class C Units. In the case of any such conversion, the Partnership shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Class C Units one or more Unit Certificates, registered in the name of such holder, for the number of Common Units to which such holder shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the Class C Conversion Effective Date whether or not the Class C Unit certificate has been surrendered as of such date, and the Person entitled to receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Common Units as of such date. 

  

 7. Section 6.1(b)(ii) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

  

 "(ii) Second, 100% to the General Partner and the Unitholders, in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests; _provided_ , that (A) Net Losses shall not be allocated pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(ii) to the extent that such allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable year (or increase any existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account) and (B) Debt Obligation Net Losses are not Nonrecourse Deductions attributable to a Nonrecourse Liability and any such Debt Obligation Net Losses shall be allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(iii); and" 

  

 8. Section 6.1(c)(ii)(B) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

  

 "(B) Second, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest and (y) to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the percentage applicable to subclause (x) of this clause (B), until the Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding has been reduced to zero; _provided_ , that Debt Obligation Net Termination Losses are not Nonrecourse Deductions attributable to a Nonrecourse Liability and any such Debt Obligation Net Termination Losses shall be allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(C)); and" 

  

 9. Section 6.1(d)(xiii) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

  

 "(xiii) _Certain Allocations to the General Partner_. (A) Any deduction or loss attributable to the Partnerships obligation to reimburse the General Partner for, or incurred by the Partnership and constituting, Excess GandA Expenses, which the General Partner has funded or agreed to fund pursuant to Section 5.2(c) and any deduction or loss attributable to environmental losses, costs, damages and expenses and repair and compliance costs suffered or incurred by the Partnership Group, which the General Partner or an Affiliate (other than a Group Member) has reimbursed or agreed to reimburse and which constitute Environmental Indemnity Obligations, shall be allocated to the General Partner, and (B) all or any portion of the remaining items of Partnership deduction or loss for the taxable period, if any, shall be allocated to the General 

   ##### 

  

 

Partner until the aggregate amount of such items allocated to the General
Partner pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(xiii)(B) for the current taxable year
and all previous taxable years is equal to the cumulative amount of all
Quarterly Devils Tower Payments made to the Partnership." 

   

 10. Section 6.1(d) is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.1(d)(xv) as follows:

The purpose for this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying converted Class C Units and the Capital Accounts underlying Common Units immediately prior to the conversion of Class C Units into Common Units. 

  

 11. Section 6.4 is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.4(d) as follows: 

  

 "(c) _Reduction in Distributions for Quarter of 2010 Contribution Agreement Closing._  

  

 (i) _Reduction in Distributions to General Partner_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of Available Cash otherwise distributable to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.3 with respect to the calendar quarter in which the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs shall be reduced by the amount equal to (A) the amount that would otherwise have been distributed with respect to the 2010 Contribution General Partner Units for such quarter multiplied by (B) a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of days commencing with the first day of such quarter and ending on the last day of the month preceding the month in which the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs and (y) the denominator of which is the total number of days in such calendar quarter. In the event that the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs prior to or on the record date for a distribution by the Partnership of Available Cash pursuant to Section 6.3 with respect to a calendar quarter prior to the calendar quarter in which the Closing of the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs, the 2010 Contribution General Partner Units shall not be taken into account in determining the Percentage Interest of the General Partner or any Unitholder with respect to such prior calendar quarter and the 2010 Contribution General Partner Units shall have no right to share in distributions of Available Cash with respect to such prior calendar quarter. 

  

 (ii) _Reduction in Distribution to Holders of Incentive Distribution Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of Available Cash otherwise distributable to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to Section 6.3 with respect to the calendar quarter in which the closing of the contributions contemplated by the 

   ##### 

  

 

2010 Contribution Agreement occurs shall be reduced by the amount equal to (A)
the excess of (x) the amount that would otherwise have been distributed to
the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights for such quarter if this
Section 6.4(d)(ii) did not exist over (y) the amount that would have been
distributed to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights for
such quarter if the contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution
Agreement had not been made and the issuances of Class C Units and General
Partner Units contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement had not
occurred, multiplied by (B) a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the
number of days commencing with the first day of such quarter and ending on
the last day of the month preceding the month in which the closing of the
contributions contemplated by the 2010 Contribution Agreement occurs and (y)
the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
calendar quarter." 

   

 12. Article VI is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.10 as follows: 

  

 "Section 6.10 _Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Class C Units_. A Unitholder holding a Class C Unit that has converted into a Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.12 shall not be issued a Unit Certificate pursuant to Sections 4.1 or 5.12(g), and shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Units until such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that the converted Class C Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.10, the General Partner shall take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to the converted Class C Units in preparation for a transfer of such Common Units, including the application of Sections 5.5(c)(iii) and 6.1(d)(xv); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units represented by Unit Certificates." 

  

 13. Except as hereby amended, the Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 14. This Amendment shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, all rights and remedies being governed by such laws without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. 

  

 15. Each provision of this Amendment shall be considered severable and if for any reason any provision or provisions herein are determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any existing or future law, such invalidity, unenforceability or illegality shall not impair the operation of or affect those provisions of this Amendment that are valid, enforceable and legal.

 _3.1 Independent Contractor._ The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted or deemed to create any relationship between or between the parties other than that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a relationship of employer and employee, master and servant, principal and agent, or partners or joint-venturers between Transco and Contractor, between Transco and any employee or agent of Contractor, or between Contractor and any employee or agent of Transco. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Transco shall have no right to control or direct the details, manner, or means by which Contractor perform the Services.

Transco shall bear all costs and expenses incurred in any inspection, examination, or audit unless an audit determines that Transco has been overcharged, in which case, in addition to refunding to Transco the amount of the overcharge, Contractor shall reimburse Transco for the cost of the audit together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from 

   ##### 

  

 

the time of the overcharge until refunded. Contractor shall review and respond
in a timely manner to any claims or inquiries made by Transco regarding
matters revealed by any such inspection, examination or audit. 

   

 _4.3 Reports._ Contractor shall prepare and deliver to Transco any reports provided for in this Agreement and such other reports as Transco may reasonably request from time to time regarding the performance of the Services. 

  

 _5\. PAYMENT TO CONTRACTOR._  

   

 _5.1_ Payment to Contractor. Contractor shall be reimbursed by Transco on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the Contractor may determine (including on a cash or accrual basis), for (a) all direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of Transco (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation, benefits, and other amounts paid to any Person, including Affiliates of Contractor) to perform the Services, including expenses allocated to Transco by Affiliates of Contractor, and (b) all other expenses allocable to the Business or otherwise incurred by Contractor in connection with operating the Business (including expenses allocated to Contractor by its Affiliates) (collectively, the "Payment Amount"). Contractor shall determine the expenses that are allocable to Transco.

Any allocation of expenses to Transco by Affiliates of Contractor in a manner consistent with then-applicable accounting and allocation methodologies generally permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") for rate-making purposes (or in the absence of then-applicable methodologies permitted by the FERC, consistent with the most-recently applicable methodologies) and past business practices shall be deemed to be fair and reasonable to Transco. For the purpose of Contractors determination of expenses under this Section 5.1, the parties agree that Transco shall be given full credit for the amount of assets Transco previously contributed (calculated immediately prior to the Effective Date) to fund post retirement benefits under any plans or trusts (including any VEBA or 401(h) account) maintained for the benefit of the employees of any Person, which employees are engaged in the performance of the Services, as the value of such assets may be increased or decreased due to investment results, administrative expenses, and benefit payments ("Funded Amount"), such that no portion of the cost of post-retirement benefits to the extent paid with the Funded Amount is allocated or charged to Transco under this Section 5.1. 

  

 _5.2 Benefit Plans._ Contractor, directly or through its Affiliates, may adopt and participate in employee benefit plans, employee programs, and employee practices (including COBRA obligations, paid time off payments, severance, retiree medical, retiree life, equity related awards, bonuses, vesting of employee benefits, retirement plans, and other employee or retiree related payments, obligations, liabilities or benefits) (collectively, "Plans and Practices"), in each case for the benefit of employees, former employees, and directors of Contractor or any of its Affiliates, in respect of Services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of Transco. Contractor, directly or through its Affiliates, has adopted and participates in (or in the future may adopt and participate in) Plans and Practices for the benefit of employees and former employees of Transco, the predecessor of Transco (Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation), and their Affiliates, in respect of services previously performed, directly or indirectly, for the 

   ##### 

  

 

benefit of Transco or its predecessor. Any and all expenses incurred or
accrued by Contractor or its Affiliates in connection with any such Plans and
Practices shall be reimbursed by Transco in accordance with the procedures
described in Section 5.1. 

   

 _6\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION._  

   

 _6.1 Nondisclosure._ Each of Contractor and Transco shall (a) not disclose to any third party or use any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other except as necessary to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, and (b) take all reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control, which will in no event be less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information of similar type and importance. 

  

 _6.2 Permitted Disclosure._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information (a) to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or otherwise as required by law, including without limitation disclosure obligations imposed under the federal securities laws, provided that such party has given the other party prior notice of such requirement when legally permissible to permit the other party to take such legal action to prevent the disclosure as it deems reasonable, appropriate or necessary, or (b) to its and its Affiliates consultants, legal counsel, accountants, financing sources, and their advisors including Persons performing duties pursuant to Section 3.2. 

  

 _7\. TERM AND TERMINATION._  

   

 _7.1 Term._ Unless terminated earlier as provided below, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect except that (a) Contractor may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days advance written notice to the other party, and (b) Contractor or Transco may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party at any time at which neither Contractor nor an Affiliate of Contractor is the general partner of Williams Partners L.P. or its successor in interest. 

  

 _7.2 Termination for Breach._ If a party shall be in breach of any provision of this Agreement (the "Breaching Party"), the non-breaching party ("Non-breaching Party") shall give the Breaching Party written notice of such breach (the "Notice"), and, subject to the terms of this Section, the Breaching Party shall have 30 days after receipt of the Notice within which to cure the breach except that no Notice shall be required if (a) the breach is an obligation to pay money, in which case the Breaching Party shall have five business days to cure the breach; (b) the same breach occurs in any six-month period; (c) the breach pertains to the Breaching Partys obligations under Section 6; or (d) a party files a petition in Bankruptcy (or is the subject of an involuntary petition in Bankruptcy that is not dismissed within 60 days after the effective filing date thereof). With respect to a breach of the obligations of a Breaching Party contained in Section 6, there is no adequate remedy at law, and the Non-Breaching Party will suffer irreparable harm as a result of such a breach. Therefore, if a breach or threatened breach by a Breaching Party of Section 6 occurs, the Non-Breaching Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from doing any act in violation thereof without the obligation of posting a bond, cash, or otherwise. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _7.3 Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 or 7.2, all rights and obligations under this Agreement shall cease except for (a) obligations that expressly survive termination of this Agreement; (b) liabilities and obligations that have accrued prior to such termination, including the obligation to pay any amounts that have become due and payable prior to such termination, (c) the obligation to pay any portion of the Payment Amount that has accrued prior to such termination, even if such portion has not become due and payable at that time, and (d) all liabilities and other obligations attributable, or in any way related to, employees and former employees of Transco, Contractor, and their respective Affiliates to the extent that such employees and former employees provided Services to Transco, and the predecessors in interest of each and the estates, heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns of each such employee and former employee (each, a "Subject Employee") including with respect to current and former Plans and Practices and any benefit, equity, or incentive related plans, programs, policies, or practices of Transco or its predecessors, all of which shall be paid when due by Transco, recognizing that the amount of some of such liabilities and other obligations shall not be known at the time of termination of this Agreement and the obligation to pay shall continue after such termination..

EXHIBIT K 

   

FORM OF SECONDMENT AGREEMENT 

   

 _(Please see attached.)_  

   ##### 

  

     

SECONDMENT AGREEMENT 

    

 This Secondment Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of [date] (the "Effective Date"), is entered into between The Williams Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Williams"), Williams Partners L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("WPZ"), and Williams Partners GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "General Partner") and the general partner of WPZ. The above-named entities are sometimes referred to in this Agreement each as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." WPZ and the General Partner are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Partnership Entities." 

  

RECITALS: 

   

 A. WPZ and its subsidiaries own and operate assets that include natural gas gathering, processing, treating and/or production handling facilities (the "Midstream Business"). 

  

 B. Williams will cause its affiliates (the "Williams Entities") to provide certain personnel necessary to operate, manage, maintain and report the operating results of the Midstream Business; 

  

 C. All management powers over the business and affairs of WPZ are exclusively vested in the General Partner, and the General Partner is required to conduct, direct and exercise full control over all activities of WPZ, including, among other things, providing various operational and maintenance resources and services; 

  

 D. In connection with the provision of services with respect to the Midstream Business conducted by _[ identify specific midstream entit(ies)] _(each, a "Midstream Entity"), Williams desires to second to the General Partner certain personnel employed or contracted by the Williams Entities; 

  

AGREEMENT: 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

 _SECTION 1_ 
  _SECONDMENT_  

   

 _1.1 Seconded Employees_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Williams agrees to cause the Williams Entities to second to the General Partner, and the General Partner agrees to accept the secondment of, those certain specifically identified individuals (each, a "Seconded Employee" and collectively, the "Seconded Employees") listed on Exhibit A (the "Seconded Employee Schedule") for the purpose of performing job functions related to the assets owned by the Midstream Entities (the "Secondment"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Seconded Employees will remain at all times employees of the Williams Entities but, in addition, they will also be temporary employees of the General Partner during the Period of Secondment (as defined below). At all times during the Period of Secondment, the Williams Entities shall instruct each Seconded Employee to comply with all lawful instructions from the General Partner regarding the performance of the Secondment Services (as defined in Section 2 below) and the Seconded Employees shall work under the direction, supervision and control of an officer of the General Partner as regards the performance of the activities under this Agreement. Williams will retain the right to cause the Williams Entities to hire or discharge the Seconded Employees but, subject to the provisions in Section 1.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement, will not have the right to cause the Williams Entities to terminate the Secondment to the General Partner or otherwise exercise direction, supervision or control over the Seconded Employees regarding the performance of the activities that are part of the Secondment Services. For each Seconded Employee, the "Period of Secondment" shall be that period of time as set forth in Section 1.2. 

  

 (c) The Seconded Employee Schedule sets forth the names of the Seconded Employees seconded by the Williams Entities, the job functions of the Seconded Employees, the starting date for the Period of Secondment for each Seconded Employee, and the names of those Seconded Employees who also provide services to Williams Entities in connection with its operations ("Shared Seconded Employees"). Except for those designated as "Shared Seconded Employees" on the Seconded Employee Schedule, each Seconded Employee shall have no actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the Williams Entities during the Period of Secondment. Individuals may be added or removed from the Seconded Employee Schedule from time to time by the execution by the Parties of a completed "Addition/Removal/Change of Responsibility of Seconded Employee" form, the form of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B, which will be fully binding on the Parties for all purposes under this Agreement. Those rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement that relate to individuals who were on the Seconded Employee Schedule but then later removed from the Seconded Employee Schedule, which rights and obligations accrued before the removal of such individual, will survive the removal of such individual from the Seconded Employee Schedule to the extent necessary to enforce such rights and obligations. 

  

 _1.2 Period of Secondment._ Williams will cause the Williams Entities to second to the General Partner each Seconded Employee on the start date set forth on the Seconded Employee Schedule and continue to second, during the period (and only during the period) that the Seconded Employee is performing services for the General Partner, until the earliest of: 

  

 (a) the end of the term of this Agreement; 

  

 (b) the end date, if any, set forth for the Seconded Employee on the Seconded Employee Schedule (or another end date for such Seconded Employee as mutually agreed in writing by the Parties) (the "End Date"); 

  

 (c) a withdrawal, departure, resignation or termination of such Seconded Employee under Section 1.3; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) the date on which a Williams Entity ceases to own a majority of the issued and outstanding voting equity of the General Partner and the General Partner has entered into satisfactory arrangements which it determines, in good faith, will provide it with suitable qualified and experienced full-time or seconded employees necessary to operate, manage, and maintain the assets of the Midstream Entities; and 

  

 (e) a termination of Secondment for such Seconded Employee under Section 1.4. 

  

 At the end of the Period of Secondment for any Seconded Employee, such Seconded Employee will no longer be subject to the direction of the General Partner with regard to the Seconded Employees day-to-day activities. 

  

 _1.3 Withdrawal, Departure or Resignation_. Williams will use reasonable efforts to cause the Williams Entities to prevent any early withdrawal, departure, resignation or termination of any Seconded Employee prior to the End Date for such Seconded Employees Period of Secondment. If any Seconded Employee tenders his resignation to a Williams Entity as an employee of such Williams Entity or a Williams Entity terminates or suspends the employment of any Seconded Employee as an employee of such Williams Entity, Williams will promptly notify the General Partner. During the Period of Secondment for any Seconded Employee, Williams will cause the Williams Entities to not voluntarily withdraw any Seconded Employee except with the written consent of the General Partner (which may be through the execution of a completed Addition/Removal/Change of Responsibility of Seconded Employee form), such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Nothing in this Agreement shall abridge, restrict or limit in any manner Williams legal right to end a Seconded Employees employment with Williams and the Williams Entities just as if the Secondment had not occurred. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to be a guarantee of a Seconded Employees employment with any of Williams or a Williams Entity for any amount of time, including without limitation the time covered by any Period of Secondment. Williams will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the General Partner and its directors, officers and employees against any and all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), claims, demands, losses, liabilities, obligations, actions, lawsuits and other proceedings, judgments and awards (each, a "Loss" and collectively, the "Losses") arising out of or in any way connected with or related to the termination of employment with a Williams Entity of any Seconded Employee by that Williams Entity without the consent of THE GENERAL PARTNER, WHICH SHALL NOT BE UNREASONABLY WITHHELD, EVEN THOUGH SUCH LOSS MAY BE CAUSED IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE PARTNERSHIP ENTITIES, except to the extent that such Losses (i) arise solely out of or result solely from the negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the Partnership Entities, or (ii) arise in connection with the termination of a Seconded Employee for cause. The General Partner and WPZ shall each indemnify, defend and hold harmless Williams, the Williams Entities and each of their directors, officers and employees against any and all Losses arising our of or in any way connected with or related to the resignation of a Seconded Employee that ends such Seconded Employees Period of Secondment or the exercise by the General Partner of its supervision and control of the day-to-day activities of a Seconded Employee, EVEN THOUGH SUCH LOSS MAY BE CAUSED IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ONE OR MORE OF WILLIAMS OR A WILLIAMS ENTITY, except to the extent that such Losses arise solely out of or result solely from the 

   ##### 

  

    

negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of Williams or any
of the Williams Entities. Upon the termination of employment, the Seconded
Employee will cease performing services for the General Partner. 

  

 _1.4 Termination of Secondment._ The General Partner will have the right to terminate the Secondment to it of any Seconded Employee for any reason at any time. Subject to Sections 1.2 and 1.3, Williams will not have the right to cause any Williams Entity to terminate the Secondment to the General Partner of any Seconded Employee. Upon the termination of a Secondment, the Seconded Employee will cease performing services for the General Partner pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. At no time will the General Partner have the right to terminate the employment with the Williams Entities of the Seconded Employees. 

  

 _1.5 Supervision._ During the Period of Secondment, the General Partner shall: 

  

 (a) be ultimately and fully responsible for the daily work assignments of the Seconded Employee (and with respect to Shared Seconded Employees during those times that the Shared Seconded Employees are performing services for the General Partner hereunder), including supervision of their day-to-day work activities and performance consistent with the terms stated in Section 1.1 and the job functions set forth in the Seconded Employee Schedule; 

  

 (b) set the hours of work and the holidays and vacation schedules (other than with respect to Shared Seconded Employees, as to which the General Partner and Williams shall jointly determine) for the Seconded Employee, so long as such determinations are not inconsistent with Williams vacation and personal absence policies and other applicable policies; and 

  

 (c) have the right to determine training which will be received by the Seconded Employee. 

  

 In the course and scope of performing any Seconded Employees job functions, the Seconded Employee will be integrated into the organization of the General Partner, will report into the General Partners management structure, and will be under the direct management and supervision of the General Partner. The General Partner shall designate one of its officers, who does not also provide services to Williams in connection with Williams exploration and production operations, to be responsible for the supervisory function set forth in this Section 1.5 on behalf of the General Partner. 

  

 _1.6 Seconded Employee Qualifications; Approval_. Williams will cause the Williams Entities to provide such suitably qualified and experienced Seconded Employees as it is able to make available to the General Partner, and the General Partner will have the right to approve or reject each such Seconded Employee. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _SECTION 2_ 
  _SECONDMENT SERVICES_  

   

 _2.1 Secondment Services_. Williams shall cause the Williams Entities to second Seconded Employees to the General Partner to provide the General Partner with certain personnel necessary for WPZ to operate, manage, maintain and report the operating results of the assets owned by the Midstream Entities (the "Secondment Services"). 

  

 _2.2 Cancellation or Reduction of Secondment Services_. The General Partner may terminate or reduce the level of any of the Secondment Services on 30 days prior written notice to Williams. 

  

 _2.3 Workers  Compensation_. At all times, Williams will cause the Williams Entities to maintain workers compensation insurance (either through an insurance company or self-insured arrangement) applicable to the Seconded Employees. Williams will cause the Williams Entities to name the General Partner as an also insured employer under such insurance policy. Prior to being assigned any duties by the General Partner, each Seconded Employee must sign an acknowledgement that the Seconded Employee is an employee during the Secondment Period of both the Williams Entities and the General Partner and that for any work place injury, the Seconded Employees sole remedy will be under such Williams Entitys workers compensation insurance policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude a Seconded Employee from participating in benefit programs generally available to employees of Williams Entities to which they are otherwise eligible and shall not imply that any Seconded Employee is entitled to any employee benefits from the General Partner or any of the Partnership Entities. 

  

 _SECTION 3_ 
  _SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT_  

   

 WPZ hereby agrees to reimburse the General Partner on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the General Partner may determine, in accordance with the reimbursement provisions of Section 7.4 of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of WPZ, dated as of August 23, 2005, as amended or restated from time to time, for the amount of all direct and indirect expenses the General Partner determines are paid or incurred on behalf of the Midstream Entities by the General Partner and the Williams Entities (without duplication) in connection with the performance of the Secondment Services during the preceding month (the "Services Reimbursement"). The General Partner shall in turn promptly pay over to Williams or its designee that portion of the Services Reimbursement that is Seconded Employee Expenses (as defined in Section 4 below). 

  

 _SECTION 4_ 
  _COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES OF SECONDED EMPLOYEES_  

   

 Williams and the Williams Entities shall be solely responsible for establishing the terms of and paying all salary or other payments (included but not limited to all other compensation, all benefits and any expense reimbursements) required to be made to the Seconded Employees pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Seconded Employees employment with Williams 

   ##### 

  

    

and the Williams Entities, and all administrative expenses associated with
the payment and delivery of such Seconded Employees compensation and
benefits, including federal and state income tax withholding, payroll taxes,
and the like, and the related reporting and administration of payroll. In
addition, Williams and the Williams Entities shall be solely responsible for
providing any health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance,
workers compensation coverage (as described in greater detail in Section
2.3), unemployment insurance, participation in and contributions to any
pension or profit-sharing plans in which a Seconded Employee is eligible to
participate by virtue of employment with a Williams Entity and all other
direct and indirect costs attributable to such Seconded Employees
compensation and benefits relating to such Seconded Employees employment
with a Williams Entity. Collectively such costs and expenses incurred
by Williams and the Williams Entities for the Seconded Employees shall be
referred to as the "Seconded Employee Expenses" and shall be included with
the definition of Services Reimbursement, which obligation to reimburse shall
be the primary legal responsibility of the General Partner. No Seconded
Employee will be entitled to additional compensation or benefits from the
Partnership Entities as a result of the performance of services pursuant to
this Agreement. Williams agrees to indemnify and hold the General Partner
harmless from any and all Losses incurred by the Partnership Entities, or any
of the Midstream Entities related to Williams failure to carry out
its responsibilities for the payment of the Seconded Employee Expenses as set
forth above, except to the extent that such Losses arise solely out of or
result solely from the negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of
any of the Partnership Entities or the Midstream Entities. 

  

 _SECTION 5_ 
  _TERM_  

   

 The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue for an initial period of [10] years. Upon the expiration of the initial [10] year period, the term of this Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional 12 month period, unless either Party provides at least 180 days prior written notice to the other Party, prior to the expiration of such initial period, that the Party wishes for this Agreement to expire at the end of the initial [10] year period. After the initial 12 month renewal period, the term of this Agreement shall automatically extend for additional 12 month periods, unless either Party provides prior written notice, at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable 12 month period, that the Party wishes for this Agreement to expire at the end of such 12 month period. Upon proper notice by a Party to the other Party, in accordance with this Section 5, that the Party wishes for this Agreement to expire on the expiration of the applicable [10] year or 12 month period, this Agreement shall not automatically extend, but shall instead expire upon the expiration of the applicable [10] year or 12 month period and only those provisions that, by their terms, expressly survive this Agreement shall so survive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may terminate this Agreement at any time, upon 180 days prior written notice to Williams, and only those provisions that, by their terms, expressly survive this Agreement shall so survive. Furthermore, this Agreement shall terminate on the date the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(d) are satisfied. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _SECTION 6_ 
  _GENERAL PROVISIONS_  

   

 _6.1 Force Majeure._ A partys obligation under this Agreement, other than an obligation to pay money and the indemnification obligations hereunder, shall be excused when and to the extent its performance of that obligation is prevented due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of a party, including the following causes (unless they are within such partys reasonable control): acts of God, strikes, lockouts, acts of the public enemy, wars or warlike action (whether actual or impending), arrests and other restraints of government (civil or military), blockades, embargoes, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, sabotage, tornadoes, named tropical storms and hurricanes, floods, civil disturbances, terrorism, mechanical breakdown of machinery or equipment, explosions, confiscation or seizure by any government or other public authority and any order of any court of competent jurisdiction, regulatory agency or governmental body having jurisdiction. The party that is prevented from performing its obligation by reason of one or more of the foregoing events (the "Delayed Party") shall promptly notify the other party of that fact and shall exercise due diligence to end its inability to perform as promptly as practicable. However, in no event shall a Delayed Party be required to settle any strike, lockout, or other labor dispute in which it may be involved, but in the event of a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute affecting the Williams Entities, the Williams Entities shall use reasonable efforts to continue to perform the Secondment Services by utilizing its management personnel and that of its Affiliates (as defined in Section 6.8 below). 

  

 _6.2 Assignments._ Except as otherwise provided herein, no Party shall sell, assign, or transfer any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations, under this Agreement to any person without the prior consent of the other Parties except that such prior consent shall not be required if such sale, assignment, or transfer is to an Affiliate of a Party or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a Party. Each of the Parties hereto specifically intends that each entity comprising the Williams Entities, the Affiliates of WPZ controlled by WPZ (the "WPZ Entities"), and the Midstream Entities, as applicable, whether or not a Party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert rights and remedies hereunder as third-party beneficiaries hereto with respect to those provisions of this Agreement affording a right, benefit or privilege to any such entity. Other than as set forth in the preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer, directly or indirectly, upon or give to any person (including any Seconded Employee) other than the Parties, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenant, condition or other provision contained herein.
