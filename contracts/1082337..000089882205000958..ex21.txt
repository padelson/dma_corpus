                        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement"), dated as of August
2, 2005, by and among Popular, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation ("Parent"),
New Popular Acquisitions Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and E-LOAN, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").  Certain capitalized terms have the
meanings given to such terms in Article VIII.

                                  RECITALS

            A.    The Board of Directors of the Company has determined
that it is advisable, and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

            B.    In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by
Parent, it is proposed:  that Merger Sub merge with and into the Company,
with the Company being the surviving corporation, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company being referred to in this Agreement as the
"Merger").

            C.    The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend
that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement.

            D.    The Board of Directors of Parent has (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are advisable, and in the best interests of, Parent and its
stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

            E.    The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and its
stockholder, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend
that the stockholder of Merger Sub adopt this Agreement.

            F.    Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, other than the Company
Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as set forth herein.

            G.    As an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement,
Mark E. Lefanowicz, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is entering
into an employment agreement dated as of the date hereof and effective at
the Effective Time.

            NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
and for other good and valuable

<PAGE>

consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                  ARTICLE I
                                 THE MERGER

     1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware
Law, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
shall continue unaffected by the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

     1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The Closing shall take place as soon as
practicable, and in any event not later than two (2) business days after the
satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI or at such other
time as the parties hereto may agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, NY 10019, or at such other location as the parties hereto may
agree in writing. The Merger shall become effective at the Effective Time as set
forth in the Certificate of Merger which shall be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date.

        1.3   EFFECTS OF THE MERGER.  At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

     1.4 CONVERSION OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

     (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock held by
Merger Sub or the Company and Company Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive $4.25 per share, subject to adjustment as provided in
Section 1.4(c) (the "Merger Consideration"). All shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by Merger
Sub or the Company shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time.

     (b) All shares of Company Common Stock converted into Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereafter represent the right to


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


receive with respect to each underlying share of Company Common Stock the Merger
Consideration.

     (c) If, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization consented to by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, then an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration.

     1.5 MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent or the Company, each share of the
common stock, $.01 par value, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one (1)
share of Company Common Stock (which shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed not to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of this Agreement).

     1.6 PARENT COMMON STOCK. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Parent Common Stock and
shall not be affected by the Merger.

     1.7 COMPANY DISSENTING SHARES. Holders of Company Dissenting Shares shall
have those rights, but only those rights, of holders who perfect their appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the Delaware Law. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demand, purported demand, objection, notice, petition, or
other communication received from stockholders or provided to stockholders by
the Company with respect to any Company Dissenting Shares or shares claimed to
be Company Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such shares. Payment of any
amount payable to the holders of Company Dissenting Shares shall be the
obligation of the Company. However, the Company agrees that, without the prior
written consent of Parent, it shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any demand or purported demand
respecting such shares.

     1.8 WARRANTS AND OPTIONS.

     (a) WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Warrant shall
be converted into the right to receive, at the Effective Time, a lump sum cash
payment equal to the product of (x) the number of shares such Warrant entitles
the holder thereof to purchase and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger
Consideration over (ii) the purchase price per share provided for under such
Warrant.

     (b) COMPANY OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Option under the 1997 Company Stock Option Plan shall fully vest, automatically
be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof the right to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares subject to such Company Option
and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the
exercise price per share of such Company Option.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>


     (c) ACTIONS. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall deliver
appropriate notices (which notices shall have been both provided to Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to review and approved by the Parent) to each holder of
Company Options setting forth each holder's rights pursuant to the 1997 Company
Stock Option Plan, and stating that such Company Options shall be treated in the
manner set forth in this Section 1.8. In addition, Company shall cause the
administrator of the 1997 Company Stock Option Plan to take such actions under
the 1997 Company Stock Option Plan as are necessary to accomplish the provisions
of this Section 1.8.

     1.9 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.10  BYLAWS.  At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

     1.11 DIRECTORS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the persons listed in Exhibit
1.11.

     1.12 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause their respective officers to take all such lawful and necessary
action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

     1.13 PARENT TO MAKE CASH AVAILABLE. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited in an Exchange Fund with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock the cash
to be exchanged for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

     1.14 EXCHANGE OF SHARES.

     (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates of Company
Common Stock whose shares are being converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.4 a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates of
Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates of
Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the certificates of Company Common Stock in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a certificate of Company
Common Stock for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
certificate of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of Merger Consideration provided in Section 1.4, and the
certificate of Company Common Stock so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash or on any unpaid dividends or
distributions payable to holders of certificates of Company Common Stock.



                                      -4-
<PAGE>

     (b) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any certificates of Company Common Stock representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, each such share shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided in Section 1.4.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of any share of Company Common Stock
prior to the Effective Time that has not been registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock shall be paid to the transferee of such share if the
certificate that previously represented such share is presented to the Exchange
Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

     (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for 18 months after the Effective Time shall be paid
to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company,
Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

     (d) In the event any certificate of Company Common Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such certificate of Company Common Stock to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate
of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate of Company Common Stock the Merger
Consideration such holder has a right to receive pursuant to this Article I.

     1.15 WITHHOLDING. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration deliverable under this
Agreement, and from any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement, such
amounts as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

     1.16 RESERVATION OF RIGHT TO REVISE STRUCTURE. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Parent may
revise the structure of the Merger by providing for a directly or indirectly
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent other than Merger Sub to be merged with and
into the Company; PROVIDED that (a) such revision does not reduce the value or
alter the form of the Merger Consideration and (b) such revised structure or
method is reasonably capable of consummation without significant delay in


                                      -5-
<PAGE>


relation to the structure contemplated herein. In the event Parent makes such an
election, the Company agrees to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement in order to reflect such election.

                                   ARTICLE II
               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

            Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule (with
specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such disclosure relates; PROVIDED that (i)
disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement
to the extent that it is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section and (ii) the mere

circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect) the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows and as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule:

     2.1 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of the Company and its

properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has furnished or made available to Parent a
complete and correct copy of the certificate or articles of incorporation, as
amended, and bylaws, as amended, and any other charter or organizational
documents, each as amended, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither

of this Agreement, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding and no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of, or
other equity

interests in, the Company shall be issued or become outstanding after the date

additional shares of its capital stock or Company Options in respect thereof,
except for shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the exercise of the
Company Options and Warrants referred to above. All shares of Company Common
Stock subject to issuance as described above shall, upon issuance on the terms
and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

     (e) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be

Company's Knowledge, nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of any
such Company Employee Benefit Plan that would cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability, penalty
or tax under ERISA or the Code. Any voluntary employees' beneficiary association
within the

Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA that is an "employee pension benefit

single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Company ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding
funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a
Company ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to
Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It
is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Pension
Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application
of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any
single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29)
of the Code.

filing of applicable reports, documents and notices regarding the Company
Employee Benefit Plans with the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of the
Treasury or the furnishing of required reports, documents or notices to the
participants or beneficiaries of the Company Employee Benefit Plans.

     (i) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, any Company Employee Benefit
Plan which is subject to ERISA, any trust created under any such Company
Employee Benefit Plan or any trustee or administrator of any such Company
Employee Benefit Plan or trust, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as
such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any
other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could reasonably be expected to
subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer of the Company or of
any of its Subsidiaries to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed
by such Section 4975 or to any material liability under Section 502(i) of ERISA.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code
or any material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

     (j) All Company Employee Benefit Plans subject to ERISA or the Code have
been maintained and administered in accordance with their terms and with all
provisions of ERISA and the Code, respectively (including rules and regulations
thereunder) and other applicable Laws and Regulations and all employees required
to be included as participants by the terms of such plans have been properly
included.

     (k) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Employee Benefit Plan which would increase materially the
expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred
therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, approval of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders nor the

employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
hereof, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits

the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any
of the Company Employee Benefit Plans or (iv) result in payments under any of

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement,
contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted, or would result, separately or
in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount that will not be fully deductible
under the Code as a result of Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or will make any payment that will not be

in each case necessary or material to the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

     (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) exclusively own all right, title
and interest in and to each item of Intellectual Property purportedly owned by
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens other than
Permitted Liens, and (ii) have a valid and enforceable right to use all
Intellectual Property used or held for use in connection with the operation of
their respective businesses as currently conducted or as currently proposed (by
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries) to be conducted. Each item of the

any rights to any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is engaging in any
activity that infringes upon, misappropriates, dilutes, violates or otherwise
interferes or conflicts with any of such Intellectual Property. No actions,
claims, proceedings or investigations alleging any of the foregoing are pending
or threatened against any Person by or on behalf of the Company or its

been no event that would permit the termination, modification, acceleration or
impairment of such Company IP Agreement, and (ii) have not received any
complaints, claims, notices or other communications alleging any of the
foregoing. The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
constitute a breach of or default under, or result in the termination,
modification, acceleration or impairment of any right of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under, any Company IP Agreement. No Company IP Agreement contains
any term or condition that would become applicable or inapplicable or whose
scope would materially change as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not trigger any modification, termination, or
acceleration under, or create any license or similar Lien on Intellectual
Property owned or used by the Parent or its Affiliates, except to the extent
that such license or Lien may be created as a result of a contract entered into
by the Parent and its Affiliates. Except as set forth in Section 2.19(e) of the

obligations are due from the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of
Intellectual Property of any third party (other than payments for licensed

valid, and enforceable, has not been adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole
or in part, and is currently in compliance in all material respects with all
formal legal requirements necessary to maintain the validity and enforceability

use, modifying the scope, or impairing the validity or enforceability of any
Intellectual Property owned, used or held for use by the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

     (g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps in
accordance with normal industry practice and in light of the nature of the
particular item of Intellectual Property to protect the proprietary nature of
each item of such Intellectual Property owned, used or held for use by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and to maintain in confidence all confidential
Intellectual Property owned, used or held for use by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ("Company Confidential Information"). No employee, independent
contractor, or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) has
misappropriated any confidential information of any other Person in the course

Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
have a written agreement with such Person with respect thereto transferring to
the Company or its Subsidiaries all right, title and interest in and to such
Intellectual Property by operation of law or by valid assignment. To the extent
internally developed, the Company and its Subsidiaries have followed reasonable
business practices in accordance with normal industry standards in developing
such Intellectual Property, including requiring each employee or contractor to
execute a written agreement in which such employee or contractor assigns to the
Company or its Subsidiaries all right, title and interest in and to such
Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has placed in
escrow or otherwise disclosed the source code or documentation for any Software
developed by or for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

of any Company Confidential Information by any third party, and (ii) no material
Company Confidential Information has been used by or disclosed to any Person
except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure and/or license
agreements, which have not been breached. The


                                      -22-

conducted, and the use of the Intellectual Property owned, used or held for use
by the Company and its Subsidiaries and Technology Systems in connection

interfere or conflict with the Intellectual Property or other rights of any
Person, and no actions, claims, proceedings or investigations are pending or

use, licensing or transfer by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any such
Intellectual Property or Technology Systems.

and/or its Subsidiaries' material agreements or arrangements relating to the
Technology Systems.

     (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of
any, and there is no pending or threatened, claim or action alleging that the

and use all Technology Systems and Third-Party Data. The Technology Systems
operate and perform materially in accordance with their documentation and
specifications, and otherwise as required in connection with the businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not modify, impair or interrupt, as applicable, (i) the
Company's, each Subsidiary's, and their customers' and suppliers' access to and
use of, or their right to access and use, the Technology Systems and Third-Party
Data. The operation of the Technology Systems, and the use, collection, storage
and dissemination of data (including Third-Party Data), by or on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with their respective businesses does
not violate any applicable Laws or Regulations.

     (f) The Technology Systems do not contain any disabling devices, viruses,
Trojan programs, worms, time bombs, bugs, faults or other devices or effects
that would (i) enable or assist any Person to access without authorization the
Technology Systems or any Third-Party Data, or (ii) otherwise adversely affect
the operation or functionality of the Technology Systems or any other Software
or systems. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps in

ensure the uninterrupted and error-free operation of the Technology Systems,
including the implementation of reasonable backup, business continuity and
disaster recovery technology and arrangements (the details of which are set

Systems have been the target of any defacement, denial-of-service, or other
attack by hackers, and, to the Company's Knowledge, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to any Technology Systems. None of the Technology Systems

Subsidiaries is in good standing under all applicable Laws and Regulations as a
mortgage broker and/or lender, (ii) there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, cancellation or reduction of any mortgage sale
agreement, home equity loan sale agreement, or auto loan sale agreement ("Loan

the obligations of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
under each such Loan Sale Agreement are being performed by the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms, and (iii)
except as set forth in Section 2.29(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there is no breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Loan Sale

contractual right to require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase any loan that was originated, closed and funded by the Company or its

whether or not for future sale or delivery (a "Loan") from such third party due
to a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by the Company or its
Subsidiary under a Loan Sale Agreement.

     (b) LOAN QUALITY; PIPELINE.

        (i) As of the date of this Agreement, no Loan has been held for sale for
more than 90 days past the date of funding other than as set forth in Section
2.29(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and subsequent to the date of this

date of funding that would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.

       (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, no Loan held for investment is (x)
more than 90 days past due with respect to any scheduled payment of principal or
interest, (y) in foreclosure or litigation or (z) subject to bankruptcy

date of this Agreement there will have been no increase in the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of such Loans more than 90 days past due, in
foreclosure or litigation, or subject to bankruptcy that would constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) COMPLIANCE. Each Loan was underwritten and originated, and the loan
documents and loan files maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
with respect thereto are being maintained by the Company or Company Subsidiary,
as the case may be, in compliance with all applicable Laws and Regulations and,
if applicable, the requirements of the Person acquiring such Loan and Insurer

invalidate, impair or be a breach of (1) any approvals or licenses of any
Governmental Entity, (2) any FHA insurance or

Subsidiaries sold Loans to an Investor. None of the Loans is a "high cost,"
"covered," "threshold" or "predatory" loan or could be classified under any
similar designation under any applicable Laws and Regulations enacted to combat
predatory lending practices. Since January 1, 2002, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has (x) engaged in any of the practices listed in OCC
Advisory Letter AL 2000-7 as "indications that an institution may be engaging in
abusive lending practices" or as practices that "may suggest the potential for
fair lending violations", (y) engaged in any "predatory" or "abusive" lending
practices as described in the Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs,
issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the
Office of Thrift Supervision on January 31, 2001, or (z) originated, owned or
serviced or currently owns or services any Loan subject to the requirements of
12 C.F.R. ss. 226.32.

     (d) SERVICING. The Loans are serviced by the Company in accordance with
applicable Laws and Regulations and with the requirements of any applicable
Investor and Loan Sale Agreement, except for immaterial failures to comply with
such requirements. No Loan is or has been serviced using predatory servicing
practices.

     (e) APPLICATION OF FUNDS. All monies received with respect to each Loan and
related escrow accounts have been properly accounted for and applied.

     (f) PAYOFF STATEMENTS. All payoff and assumption statements with respect to
each Loan were, at the time provided, true and correct, except for immaterial
discrepancies.

     (g) ESCROW ACCOUNTS. Unless otherwise prohibited by Laws or Regulations or
pursuant to an executed escrow waiver, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
collected all escrows related to each mortgage loan (including each home equity
loan) that was originated, closed and funded by the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is held for either the Company's or its Subsidiary's account, whether or
not for future sale or delivery (a "Mortgage Loan"), and all escrow accounts
have been maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in
accordance with all applicable Laws and Regulations and the requirements of
Investors and Insurers. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have
credited to the account of mortgagors all interest required to be paid on any
escrow account in accordance with applicable Laws and Regulations and the terms
of such agreements and loan documents.

     (h) SINGLE FAMILY LOANS. All of the Mortgage Loans were secured by
one-to-four-family residential real property or, to the extent that a Mortgage
Loan was secured by property other than a one-to-four-family residential
property, such Mortgage Loan has not been sold to any Person where the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries could have any recourse obligation.


                                      -28-
<PAGE>


     (i) POOLS. Other than Loans pending delivery to Investors, none of the
Loans is or has been included by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
pool or securitization.

     (j) MORTGAGE INSURANCE. Each Mortgage Loan that is required to be covered
by FHA insurance is insured under the National Housing Act or qualifies for
insurance thereunder and timely and proper application has been made for such
insurance. Each Mortgage Loan that is required to be guaranteed by the VA is
guaranteed under the provisions of Chapter 37 of Title 38 of the United States
Code or qualifies for such guarantee and timely and proper application has been
made for such guarantee. As to each FHA insurance certificate, each VA guarantee
certificate, and each Mortgage Loan that is required to be insured by private
mortgage insurance, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, has complied with applicable provisions of the insurance or guarantee
contract and applicable Laws and Regulations.

     (k) INSURANCE. Each Mortgage Loan has been covered by a policy of hazard
insurance and flood insurance, to the extent required by the Loan Sale Agreement
relating thereto or any Laws and Regulations or Investor or Insurer requirements
applicable to such Mortgage Loan, all in a form usual and customary in the
mortgage banking industry. Any and all claims under such insurance policies have
been submitted and processed in accordance with the applicable Investor's
requirements.

     (l) TITLE INSURANCE. To the extent required by the applicable Investor,
each Mortgage Loan was covered by an American Land Title Association lender's
title insurance policy or other generally acceptable form of policy of insurance
acceptable to the relevant Investor, and each such title insurance policy was
issued by a title insurer acceptable to the applicable Investor and qualified to
do business in the jurisdiction where the collateral securing such loan was
located, and insured the originator and its successors and assigns as to the
first priority lien of the mortgage in the original principal amount of the
Mortgage Loan. The applicable Investor, as assignee of the originator's rights,
is an insured of such lender's title insurance policy, and such lender's policy
is in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
performed any act or omission that would impair the coverage of such lender's
policy.

     (m) AUDITS AND INQUIRIES. Except for customary ongoing quality control
reviews, no audit or investigation by a Governmental Entity, an Investor or an
Insurer is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that is
reasonably likely to result in:

                  (1)   a claim of a failure to comply with applicable
regulations,

                  (2)   rescission of any insurance or guaranty contract
or agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

                  (3)   payment, by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, of a penalty (other than any immaterial payment) to any
Governmental Entity, an Investor or an Insurer; or

                  (4)   revocation of any Authorization set forth in
Section 2.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including any
Authorization to do business, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

a Superior Proposal, which is pending at the time the Company determines to take
such action; and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good

                                      -36-

financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or
similar transaction with respect to either the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions, which is structured to permit such Third Party or another

passed following Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company advising
Parent that the Company's Board of Directors has received such a Superior

Board of Directors shall have concluded in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, is as favorable
(taking into account the Termination Fee) to the Company's stockholders as such
Superior Proposal, and (D) concurrently with taking such action the Company
shall pay any applicable fee required by Section 7.3.

     5.1 REGULATORY MATTERS.

     (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare, allow Parent to review and then file with the SEC a proxy
statement and other proxy materials in preliminary form and shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or
its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to
the satisfaction of the SEC. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the
time when the preliminary proxy statement, the Proxy Statement and any amendment
or supplement thereto has


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

been filed, and of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
regarding, and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to, the preliminary proxy statement or the Proxy Statement, or for
additional information, and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC,
on the other hand, with respect to the preliminary proxy statement, the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders'
Meeting there shall occur any event that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company shall consult with Parent prior to mailing the Proxy
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent timely and
reasonably objects. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto.

     (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to, (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger, including, without limitation, obtaining any third party
consent which may be required to be obtained in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to remove any restraint
or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VI, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) obtain (and cooperate with the other
party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity which is required to be obtained by Parent
or the Company, respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other promptly to
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent necessary, any
notification required by the HSR Act), and to obtain as promptly as practicable
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, all the information relating to the
other or any of its Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case subject to applicable Laws and
Regulations relating to the exchange of information. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each
party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each of Parent and the Company shall not, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries not to, engage in any action or transaction that would materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger.


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

Parent and the Company further covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened
or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling
or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, to use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

     (c) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, employees and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice, application or other document made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

     (d) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such approval will be materially delayed.

     5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company agrees to provide Parent and Parent's officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors, agents and other representatives

other matters required to be approved for consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"). The
Company Stockholders' Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company
in consultation with Parent) as promptly as practicable after the mailing of the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company
Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and
Regulations. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of
Directors, the Proxy Statement shall include a recommendation of the Company's
Board of Directors that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement
(the "Company Board Recommendation").

and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statement or making any other public (or
non-confidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry)
regarding the terms of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such
statement or disclosure without the prior approval of the other (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by Laws or Regulations or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ, in which case the
party proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or
disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other party before issuing such press release or making such public
statement or disclosure.

     5.5 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of the
parties to this Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
effect the transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill and cause to be
fulfilled the conditions to Closing under this Agreement. Each party hereto, at
the reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
necessary or desirable for effecting the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.6 EMPLOYEES; EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS.

     (a) For a transition period not to exceed one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide those
individuals employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Covered Employees") with base salaries and
other compensation opportunities and benefits (other than stock options and
other equity based plans) no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the base
salaries and other compensation opportunities and benefits provided to the
Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following such
transition period, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to,
provide such Covered Employees with base salaries and other compensation
opportunities and benefits substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
base salaries and other compensation opportunities and benefits (other than
stock options and other equity based plans) provided to employees similarly
situated to such Covered Employees of Popular Financial Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

of doubt, nothing herein shall limit the right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any time or
require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to maintain any particular
compensation or benefit program.

     (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate
in a compensation or benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than those of the Company or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall
cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered
Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries (and their respective
predecessors) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other
than under any "final average pay" defined benefit pension plan) under such
compensation or benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the same
extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under
a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a
participant immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if there is no such
comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under
the Company's 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, PROVIDED that
such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits with
respect to the Covered Employee, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or
vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the
plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible to
participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such Parent
or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
such eligibility, and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses
incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the date on which
such Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

     (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, honor all written
contractual obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to their respective
current and former employees, directors and independent contractors, including,
but not limited to, all obligations under employment, severance and consulting
plans and arrangements and under all Company Employee Benefit Plans, if
applicable.

     (d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, subject
to applicable law and the terms of the applicable plan the Company shall take
all actions necessary to terminate the Company's 401(k) Plan and all Company
employee benefit plans effective immediately prior to or simultaneous with the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing,
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and Regulations and the terms of the
applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the
employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent
necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
commence to participate therein following the Effective Time unless the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such
participation. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted
by applicable Laws and Regulations and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, Parent shall cause to be amended, or take any actions that Parent
deems appropriate, the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its
Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

no employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall commence to participate
therein following the Effective Time unless Parent or such Subsidiary explicitly
authorizes such participation.

     (e) Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall be interpreted as preventing the
Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any Parent benefit
plans, Company Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans, contracts,
arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with their terms and
applicable Laws and Regulations.

5.7   DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION.

     (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall, with respect to indemnification of officers, directors,
employees and agents, not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of the persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time were identified as
prospective indemnitees under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), unless such
modification is required by Law.

     (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Laws and Regulations, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the present and former
officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in their capacities as such (each, an "Indemnified Party") against
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and pertaining to any matter existing
or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or taken at the request of Parent pursuant to
Section 5.5.

     (c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company
(PROVIDED that Parent may substitute therefor policies with substantively the
same coverage and amounts and on terms and conditions which are reasonably
comparable to those of such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors
in their capacity as such; PROVIDED that in no event shall Parent be required to
expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Insurance
Amount"); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if Parent is unable to maintain such policy
(or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

     (d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this section.

     (e) The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

     5.8 ADVICE OF CHANGES. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise each
other of any change or event having a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

     5.9 SECTION 16B-3. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take
commercially reasonable actions as may be required to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities
of the Company by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act.

consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; nor shall there be any statute,

prohibits the consummation of the Merger. In the event an injunction or other
order shall have been issued, each party agrees to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted.

     (c) GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. Parent, the Company and Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries shall have obtained from each Governmental Entity all
approvals, waivers and consents necessary for consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, such

Parent set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date as though made on such date, except to the extent such representations and
warranties are expressly made only as of an earlier date, in which case as of

<PAGE>

warranties (for this purpose disregarding any qualification or limitation as to

owed to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a) except that termination will not
relieve a breaching party from liability for fraud or any willful material
breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

     9.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such
state's principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court
and the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this

OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY. IF
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS
PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A NON-COMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

     9.12 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree
to replace such illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a legal, valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such illegal,
void, invalid or unenforceable provision.
