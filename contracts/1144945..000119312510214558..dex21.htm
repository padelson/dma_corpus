Subsidiaries, if any) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.98
Partners Common Units (the "Merger Consideration") which Partners Common Units

Laws and the Partners Partnership Agreement and the Partners Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement, as applicable, fully paid (to the extent

Restated Partnership Agreement, as applicable) and non-assessable (except to

(c) All Holdings Common Units, when converted in the Merger, shall cease to

Units (a "Certificate") and each holder of non-certificated Holdings Common

rights with respect thereto, except (A) the right to receive distributions in
accordance with Section 3.2, and (B) the right to receive (i) the Merger
Consideration, (ii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional New Partners
Common Unit in accordance with Section 3.3(e) and (iii) any distributions in
accordance with Section 3.3(c), and in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.3.



 

11 Section 3.2 _Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers._ At the Effective Time,
holders of Holdings Common Units shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, limited partners of Holdings, other than to receive (a) any distribution
with respect to such Holdings Common Units with a record date occurring prior
to the Effective Time that may have been declared by Holdings on such
Holdings Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Holdings Partnership Agreement and which remains unpaid at the Effective Time
and (b) the consideration provided under this Article III. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the unit transfer books of
Holdings with respect to the Holdings Common Units.

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent._ Partners shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Holdings Common
Units, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange
Agent, the New Partners Common Units and cash as required by this Article III.
Partners agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 3.2(a)
and Section 3.3(c) and to make payments in lieu of any fractional New Partners
Common Units pursuant to Section 3.3(e). Any cash and New Partners Common
Units deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any
fractional New Partners Common Units in accordance with Section 3.3(e) and any
distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(c)) shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
Holdings Common Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by Sections 3.3(c) and 3.3(e), the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Partners shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Holdings Common
Units (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that in respect of
certificated units, delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and agreed to by Partners
and Holdings prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Holdings Common Units
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in
respect of Book-Entry Units) as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holders of Holdings Common Units shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) New Partners Common Units representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of New Partners Common Units that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III (after taking into
account all Holdings Common Units then held by such holder) and (B) a check in
the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this Article III, including cash payable in lieu
of any fractional New Partners Common Units pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and
distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(c). No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid distributions



 

12  payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Holdings Common Units that is not registered in the
transfer records of Holdings, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Holdings Common Units may be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate
representing such Holdings Common Units or evidence of ownership of the Book-
Entry Units are presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of both
certificated and book-entry Holdings Common Units, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the record holder of such
Holdings Common Units, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until the required
documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any, have been
surrendered, as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the Holdings Common Units (including any cash in lieu of
fractional units pursuant to Section 3.3(e)) and any distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Holdings Common Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Partners Common Units with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Holdings Common Units with respect to the New Partners Common Units that such
holder would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional New Partners Common Units shall be paid to any
such holder until such holder shall deliver the required documentation and
surrender any Certificate as contemplated by this Section 3.3. Subject to
applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of Section 3.3(b),
there shall be paid to such holder of the New Partners Common Units issuable
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New Partners
Common Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and
the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to the New Partners Common Units and payable
with respect to such New Partners Common Units, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such compliance payable with respect to such New Partners Common Units.

 

(d) _Further Rights in Holdings Common Units_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a Holdings Common Unit in accordance with the terms hereof
and any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2, Section 3.3(c) or Section 3.3(e)
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Holdings Common Unit. 

(e) _Fractional Partners Common Units_. No certificates or scrip of the New
Partners Common Units representing fractional New Partners Common Units or
book entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the exchange of Holdings
Common Units in accordance with Section 3.3(b), and such fractional interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder
of any New Partners Common Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Holdings Common Units exchanged in the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a New Partners
Common Unit (after taking into account all Holdings Common Units exchanged by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu

  

 

13  thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the closing sale price of the Partners
Common Units on the NYSE as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ on the
trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall
occur and (ii) the fraction of a New Partners Common Unit that such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so
notify Partners, and Partners shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent
to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
constituting New Partners Common Units or cash that remains undistributed to
the holders of Holdings Common Units after 180 days following the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Partners upon demand and, from and after such
delivery, any former holders of Holdings Common Units who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Partners for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Holdings
Common Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New Partners Common Units to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and any distributions with
respect to the New Partners Common Units to which they are entitled pursuant
to Section 3.3(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Holdings Common Units immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Partners, free and clear of any Liens, claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. Neither Partners, Partners GP, Holdings, Holdings GP, nor
the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Holdings Common Units
for any Partners Common Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Partners,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Partners
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Holdings Common Units represented by such Certificate and any
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.2.

 

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Partners, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Holdings Common
Units such amounts as Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of
state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment;
provided, however, that Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, shall provide reasonable notice to the applicable holders
of Holdings Common Units prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this
Section 3.3(i). To the extent that amounts are so



 

14  deducted and withheld by Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Holdings Common Units in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by Partners, the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(j) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Partners Common Units as
Additional Limited Partners of Partners_. Upon the issuance of New Partners
Common Units to the holders of Holdings Common Units in accordance with this
Section 3.3 and the compliance by such holders with the requirements of
Section 10.4 of the Partners Amended and Restated Partnership
Agreement, Partners GP shall consent to the admission of such holders as
limited partners of Partners and reflect such admission on the books and
records of Partners.

 

Section 3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or distributions
in the form of equity interests with respect to the Holdings Common Units and
the Partners Common Units (in each case, as permitted pursuant to Section
4.3), the number of New Partners Common Units to be issued in the Merger and
the average closing sales prices of the Partners Common Units determined in
accordance with Section 3.3(e) will be correspondingly adjusted.

 

Section 3.5 _Holdings LTIP Deferred Common Units_.

 

(a) (i) At the Effective Time, each Holdings Deferred Common Unit credited to
a participant under the Holdings LTIP immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into 0.98 Partners Deferred Common Units credited under the
Partners LTIP, except that if the aggregate number of Partner Deferred Common
Units that would be credited to a participant after such conversion
would result in such participant being credited with a fractional Partners
Deferred Common Unit, then, in lieu thereof, such participant shall be
entitled to receive cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole
cent), in an amount calculated as provided in Section 3.3(e).

(ii) Prior to, or as of, the Effective Time, the Holdings GP Board shall
take all necessary actions, if any, pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the Holdings LTIP and the grant agreements evidencing the Holdings
Deferred Common Units, to provide for the automatic conversion on the
Effective Time of the Holdings Deferred Common Units into Partners Deferred
Common Units under the Partners LTIP in accordance with this Section 3.5,
without the consent of the holders of the Holdings Deferred Common Units.

 

(b) (i) On, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the Effective Time,
Partners shall deliver to each affected participant in the Holdings LTIP a
new grant agreement setting forth the terms of such participants Partners
Deferred Common Units credited under the Partners LTIP as a result of the
automatic conversion of the participants Holdings Deferred Common Units as
provided herein, which grant agreement shall continue the same terms
applicable to the Holdings Deferred Common Units credited under the Holdings
LTIP.

 

(ii) Partners shall take all necessary actions on, or prior to, the Effective
Time, to authorize and reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Partners
Common Units for delivery with respect to the Partners Deferred Common Units
credited under the Partners LTIP on the conversion of the Holdings Deferred
Common Units in accordance with this Section 3.5. 



 

15 (iii) The Holdings LTIP shall be terminated on, or immediately following, the
Effective Time.

Section 3.6 _Tax Treatment_. If, for federal income tax purposes, the
resulting partnership from the Merger is determined by Partners GP to be a
continuation of Partners, then Partners, Partners GP, Holdings and Holdings GP
intend to take the position that the Merger will constitute an "assets-over"
partnership merger within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(3)(i), and, as a result, (i) the receipt of cash in lieu of the
receipt of fractional New Partners Common Units in exchange for Holdings
Common Units in connection with the Merger shall be treated as a sale of such
Holdings Common Units by the holder and a purchase of such Holdings Common
Units by Partners for the cash so paid under the terms of this Agreement in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4), and (ii) upon the
receipt of the Holdings Unitholder Approval, each such holder of Holdings
Common Units who accepts cash shall agree and consent to the treatment
described in clause (i) as a condition to receiving such consideration,
in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4).

the Partners Recommendation (any such action being referred to as a "Partners

of this Agreement). Any Partners Change in Recommendation shall not change the
approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Partners GP Board or

contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if there has been a Partners Change in Recommendation and
Partners has not breached its obligations under this Section 6.2(c), Partners
shall not be obligated to call, hold or convene the Partners Meeting and

Partners Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement) and any other action

respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are not permitted to disclose
under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request. Neither
Holdings nor Partners nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or

in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, fiduciary
duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence

the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-
public information with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, but subject to the limitations in Section 6.7(b), nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Holdings and Holdings GP from
furnishing any information to, including information pertaining to Partners
or its Subsidiaries, or entering into or participating in discussions or
negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a knowing and intentional breach of this
Section 6.7 (a "Receiving Party"), if (i) the Holdings GP Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, determines
in good faith (A) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is likely to
result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the Holdings Partnership
Agreement and applicable Law and (ii) prior to furnishing any such non-public
information to such Receiving Party, Holdings receives from such Receiving
Party an executed Confidentiality Agreement, _provided, however,_ that if
Holdings receives an Acquisition Proposal that includes a Partners
Acquisition Proposal, Holdings may, in its discretion, respond to a Receiving
Party to indicate that Holdings cannot entertain an Acquisition Proposal that
includes a Partners Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Holdings may provide any Receiving Party with any non-public information
or data pertaining to Partners (the "Partners Non-Public Information") only
if Holdings has not knowingly and intentionally breached this Section 6.7 and
then only if (i) the Holdings GP Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors



 

28  that the provision of such Partners Non-Public Information to the Receiving
Party could possibly lead to a Holdings Change in Recommendation and (ii)
Holdings shall have first (A) required the Receiving Party to execute a
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) furnished a copy of such Confidentiality
Agreement to Partners and (C) notified Partners of the identity of such
Receiving Party. Holdings shall promptly provide or make available to

Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any Receiving Party
pursuant to this Section 6.7 which was not previously provided or
made available to Partners. Partners shall provide to Holdings and any
Receiving Party that has executed a Confidentiality Agreement any Partners
Non-Public Information that Holdings reasonably requests in exercising its
rights under this Section 6.7. Holdings shall not provide to any Receiving
Party, and Partners shall not be required to provide to any Receiving Party,
in each case pursuant to this Section 6.7, any information pertaining to
Partners where Holdings knows that the provision of such information would
(x) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession
or control of such information or (y) contravene any Law or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.7(c), the Holdings GP Board
shall not (1) (a) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Partners the Holdings Recommendation or (b) publicly approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (1) being referred to as a "Holdings Change in
Recommendation"); or (2) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or allow Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to

contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or
in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Holdings Unitholder Approval, the Holdings
GP Board may make a Holdings Change in Recommendation if it has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that failure to make a Holdings Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the Holdings Partnership
Agreement and applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Holdings GP
Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Holdings Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless Holdings and Holdings GP have:
(i) complied in all material respects with this Section 6.7, (ii) provided to
Partners and the Partners Conflicts Committee two (2) Business Days prior
written notice (such notice, a "Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change")
advising Partners that the Holdings GP Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including, if
applicable, the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action and the identity of the Person making the
proposal and contemporaneously providing a copy of all relevant proposed
transaction documents for such Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change and an
additional two (2) Business Day period), (iii) during such period, Holdings
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Partners and its
Representatives to amend this Agreement so as to enable the Holdings GP Board
and/or the Holdings Conflicts Committee to proceed with the Holdings
Recommendation and at the end of such period, maintain the Holdings
Recommendation (after taking into account any agreed modification to the
terms of this Agreement), and (iv) if applicable, provided to Partners all



 

29  materials and information delivered or made available to the Person or group
of persons making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior
Proposal (to the extent not previously provided). Any Holdings Change in
Recommendation shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other
approval of the Holdings GP Board, including in any respect that would have
the effect of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Partners and Partners GP shall
maintain, and cause their Representatives to maintain, the confidentiality of
all information received from Holdings pursuant to this Section 6.7, subject
to the exceptions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of Holdings set forth in this Section 6.7,
Holdings shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours
after receipt) advise Partners orally and in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal. Holdings shall keep Partners informed on a
reasonably current basis of material developments with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Holdings or the Holdings
GP Board from taking and disclosing to the holders of Holdings Common Units a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to limited partners) or from making

Holdings GP LLC Agreement, or this Agreement or, if applicable,
similar organizational documents or agreements of any of Holdings
Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Partners and the Surviving
Entity, jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is at the date hereof or during the period from



 

31  the date hereof through the date of the Effective Time serving as a director
or officer of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Holdings GP) or as a fiduciary under or with respect to
any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection
with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or

the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification
and advancement obligations of Partners and the Surviving Entity pursuant to
this Section 6.13(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before
the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to
any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall

employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) after the

and personal and legal representatives. As used in this Section 6.13: (x) the
term "Claim" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action,
whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any
other person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to
the institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism ("Action"), arising out of
or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director or officer of Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries, or as a
fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing at or
prior to the Effective Time; and (y) the term "Indemnification Expenses" means
reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,

as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant
to this Section 6.13(a), including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither
Partners nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Action in respect of which
indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.



 

32 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Partners and Holdings agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Holdings
Partnership Agreement (and, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of Holdings Subsidiaries including, without limitation, the
Holdings GP LLC Agreement) and indemnification agreements of Holdings or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity, Partners and
Partners GP in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Partners
Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the
Holdings Partnership Agreement and the Holdings GP LLC Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be
required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

 

(d) Partners shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain for a
period of at least six (6) years following the Effective Time, the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
Holdings and its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Holdings
GP) ( _provided,_ that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are not less advantageous to such directors and officers of Holdings
than the terms and conditions of such existing policy from carriers with the
same or better rating as the carrier under the existing policy provided that
such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect
to matters occurring before the Effective Time) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including
in respect of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided,_ that Partners shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Holdings prior to the date
hereof but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

 

(e) The provisions of Section 6.13(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied
if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained by the Surviving Entity for
purposes of this Section 6.13 from carriers with the same or better rating as
the carrier of such insurances as of the date of this Agreement, which
policies provide such directors and officers with the coverage described in
Section 6.13(d) for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including, in respect of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

33 (f) If Partners, Partners GP, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership
or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Partners, Partners GP and the Surviving Entity assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.

(g) Partners and Partners GP shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all
of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 6.13.

(h) This Section 6.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and
personal representatives, and shall be binding on Partners, Partners GP, the
Surviving Entity and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Holdings and Partners
shall give prompt notice to the other of (a) any fact, event or circumstance
known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein, and (b) any change in its condition (financial or
otherwise) or business or any litigation or governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings, in each case to the extent such change,
litigation, complaints, investigations, or hearings, individually or in the
aggregate, results in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it.

Section 6.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdings shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Holdings equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of Holdings to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-
Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

 

Section 6.16 _Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of Partners_. Subject
to receipt of the Partners Unitholder Approval, Partners GP shall execute and
make effective at the Effective Time the Partners Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement.

 

Section 6.17 _Partners GP Board Membership_. The Partners GP Amended and
Restated LLC Agreement shall provide that the Partners GP Board shall consist
of nine (9) members. Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement,
Holdings shall designate the three (3) members of the Holdings Conflicts

Partners GP Board following the Effective Time. The Partners GP Board shall
nominate the Holdings Directors Designees for election to the Partners GP

Time. Subject to the foregoing, Partners GP shall take such action as is
necessary to



 

34  cause each director designated pursuant to this Section 6.17 to be appointed

or warranty by Partners or Partners GP) or Section 7.5 (in the case of

compared to U.S. federal income tax due from such holders as a result of
owning or disposing of any Holdings Common Units in the event the transactions

owning or disposing of the Partners Common Units, as compared to U.S. federal
income tax due from such holders in the event the transactions contemplated by
Article III did not occur; _provided_ that Partners shall not have the right

intention has otherwise become publicly known to Holdings unitholders
generally and in any event such proposal or intention is not subsequently
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Holdings or

 



 

40  Partners pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii) or by Partners
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv) or Section 8.1(b)(v) and (iii) within 12 months
after the termination of this Agreement, Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into any definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, or
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries is
consummated, then Holdings shall pay to the Escrow Agent for the benefit of
Partners, if and when consummation of such Acquisition Proposal occurs, the
Holdings Termination Fee less all Expenses of Partners previously paid to
Partners; _provided_ that for purposes of this Section 9.1(c), "50%" shall be
substituted for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Holdings or Partners pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(vi) or (ii) Holdings pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv) or Section
8.1(b)(v), then Partners shall pay to Holdings the Expenses of Holdings. If
this Agreement is terminated by (i) Partners pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv) or
Section 8.1(b)(v) or (ii) Holdings or Partners pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii), then Holdings shall pay to Partners the Expenses of Partners.

 

(e) Except as otherwise provided herein, any payment of the Holdings
Termination Fee or the Partners Termination Fee or Expenses pursuant to this
Section 9.1 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account of the Partners Escrow Agent designated by Partners or an account
of the Holdings Escrow Agent designated by Holdings, as applicable, within
one Business Day after such payment becomes payable; _provided, however,_
that any payment of the Holdings Termination Fee by Holdings or the Partners
Termination Fee by Partners as a result of termination under Section 8.1(c)(i)
or Section 8.1(d)(i) shall be made prior to or concurrently with termination
of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that any payment of the Holdings
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.1(c) shall be made contemporaneously
with the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal as provided in clause (iii)
of Section 9.1(c). The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.1 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties would
enter into this Agreement.

(f) (i) If the Merger is consummated, Partners shall pay, or cause to be
paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on either party in
connection with the Merger, (ii) expenses incurred in connection with filing,
printing and mailing the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement
shall be paid by Partners and (iii) any filing fees payable pursuant to
regulatory Laws and other filing fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring the fees. As used in this
agreement, "Expenses" includes all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on
its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and the
solicitation of unitholder approvals and all other matters related to the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the amount of Expenses
payable by one party to another under this Section 9.1 shall not exceed $6
million.



 

41 (g) Any amounts paid to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Article IX, together
with interest thereon (the "Escrow Fund"), shall be released by the Escrow
Agent to Partners or to Holdings, as applicable, as follows:

 

(i) Prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment was made to the
Escrow Agent, Partners or Holdings, as applicable, shall submit to the Escrow
Agent a certificate demanding a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to no greater
than 70% of the maximum remaining amount which, in the good faith view of the
Partners GP or Holdings GP, as applicable, may still be taken into the gross
income of Partners or Holdings, as applicable, without exceeding the
permissible qualifying income (as defined in Section 7704 of the Code) limits
for a publicly traded partnership, after taking into consideration all other
sources of non-qualifying income (such maximum remaining amount, the "Non-
Qualifying Income Cushion"), and the Escrow Agent shall within one Business
Day thereafter, pay Partners or Holdings, as applicable, the amount
demanded, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Partners or Holdings, as applicable;

 

(ii) During the calendar year following the date that the payment was made to
the Escrow Agent but prior to the passage of 30 Business Days following the
filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior year, Partners or Holdings, as
applicable, shall submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate identifying the
actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion from the prior year. If the payment
contemplated by clause (i) above was (A) less than 80% of the actual Non-
Qualifying Income Cushion, then Partners or Holdings, as applicable, shall
submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate demanding a portion of the Escrow
Fund equal to an amount which, when combined with the payment contemplated by
clause (i) will equal 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, and the
Escrow Agent shall within one Business Day thereafter, pay Partners or
Holdings, as applicable, the amount demanded, (B) greater than or equal to
80%, but less than or equal to 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income
Cushion, then Partners or Holdings, as applicable, shall notify the Escrow
Agent that it will not demand any additional payments from the Escrow Fund,
and (C) greater than 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, then
Partners or Holdings, as applicable, shall deliver a certificate to such
effect to the Escrow Agent and return to the Escrow Fund an amount equal to
the excess of the payment contemplated by clause (i) over 90% of the Non-
Qualifying Income Cushion. Any payment under this clause (ii) shall be made by
the Escrow Agent, or by Partners or Holdings, as applicable, as the case may
be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Partners or Holdings, as applicable, or the Escrow Agent, as the case may
be; and

 

(iii) Within one Business Day following the earlier of (A) completion of the
procedures as contemplated by Section 9.1(g)(ii) above and (B) the passage of
30 days following the filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior year, the
Escrow Agent shall pay Holdings or Partners, as applicable, the remainder, if
any, of the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Holdings or Partners, as applicable.



 

42 Each of Holdings and Partners, as applicable, acknowledges and agrees that (x)
the amount of a payment, if any, pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above is
uncertain, and that depending on the amount of the demands made by Partners or
Holdings, as applicable, pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above, the Escrow Fund
may be insufficient to permit payments to Holdings or Partners, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above, and (y) it shall have no
rights to any amounts in the Escrow Fund (other than as contemplated by this
subsection (g)) or to audit or inquire into the amounts demanded by or paid
to Partners or Holdings, as applicable.

(h) Holdings agrees that, notwithstanding any right that it or Partners GP
may otherwise have, including pursuant to the Partners Partnership Agreement,
the Partners Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, or otherwise, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, it hereby waives and renounces for itself
and its Affiliates, and shall cause Partners GP to waive and renounce, any
distribution by Partners to its partners of any amount paid to Partners by the
Escrow Agent, together with an income allocation associated with
such distribution, it being understood that following payment to Partners
from the Escrow Agent, Partners will make a distribution to the holders of
Partners Common Units who are unaffiliated with Holdings.

 

(i) This Section 9.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.2 _Waiver; Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law,
prior to the Closing, any provision of this Agreement may be (a) waived in
writing by the party benefited by the provision and approved by the Partners
Conflicts Committee in the case of Partners and by the Holdings Conflicts
Committee in the case of Holdings and executed in the same manner as this
Agreement, or (b) amended or modified at any time, whether before or after the
Holdings Unitholder Approval or before or after the Partners Unitholder
Approval, by an agreement in writing between the parties hereto approved by
the Partners Conflicts Committee in the case of Partners and by the Holdings
GP Board in the case of Holdings and executed in the same manner as this
Agreement, provided, that after the Holdings Unitholder Approval, no amendment
shall be made that requires further Holdings Unitholder Approval without such
approval, and after the Partners Unitholder Approval, no amendment shall be
made that requires further Partners Unitholder Approval without such approval.

 

Section 9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

Section 9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflict of law principles thereof (except to the extent that
mandatory provisions of federal or Delaware law govern).

 

Section 9.5 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto and their respective
agents, attorneys and accountants will maintain the confidentiality of all
information provided in connection herewith to the extent required by, and
subject to the limitations of, Section 6.6(b).

 

Section 9.6 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications
hereunder to a party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if
personally delivered, telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered

15 Nothing contained in this Section 2.6(a) shall be construed as authorizing the
General Partner to amend this Agreement except in accordance with Article
XIII or as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable and
a power coupled with an interest, and it shall survive and, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, not be affected by the subsequent death,
incompetency, disability, incapacity, dissolution, bankruptcy or termination
of any Limited Partner or Assignee and the transfer of all or any portion of
such Limited Partners or Assignees Partnership Interest and shall extend to
such Limited Partners or Assignees heirs, successors, assigns and personal
representatives. Each such Limited Partner or Assignee hereby agrees to be
bound by any representation made by the General Partner or the Liquidator
acting in good faith pursuant to such power of attorney; and each such

faith under such power of attorney. Each Limited Partner or Assignee shall
execute and deliver to the General Partner or the Liquidator, within 15 days
after receipt of the request therefor, such further designation, powers of
attorney and other instruments as the General Partner or the Liquidator deems
necessary to effectuate this Agreement and the purposes of the Partnership.

title is held in the name of the General Partner or one or more of its
Affiliates or one or more nominees shall be held by the General Partner or
such Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the Partnership in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to cause record title to such
assets (other than those assets in respect of which the General Partner
determines that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of
record title to the Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the
Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, further, that, prior
to the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to effect the
transfer of record title to the Partnership and, prior to any such transfer,
will provide for the use of such assets in a manner satisfactory to the
General Partner. All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of
the Partnership in its books and records, irrespective of the name in which

impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability of the Limited Partners
or Assignees under this Agreement.

Section 3.3 _Outside Activities of the Limited Partners._

ARTICLE IV 

CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS;

 

REDEMPTION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

 

Section 4.1 _Certificates_.

 

Upon the Partnerships issuance of Common Units to any Person, the Partnership
shall issue one or more Certificates in the name of such Person evidencing
the number of such Units being so issued. In addition, upon the request of any
Person owning any other Partnership Securities other than Common Units, the
Partnership shall issue to such Person one or more certificates evidencing
such other Partnership Securities other than Common Units. Certificates shall
be executed on behalf of the Partnership by the Chairman of the Board,
President, Chief Executive Officer or any Executive Vice President or Vice
President and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the General
Partner. No Common Unit Certificate shall be valid for any purpose until it
has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent; provided, however, that if the
General Partner elects to issue Common Units in global form, the Common Unit
Certificates shall be valid upon receipt of a certificate from the Transfer
Agent certifying that the Common Units have been duly registered in accordance
with the directions of the Partnership. Notwithstanding the above provisions,
Common Units may be uncertificated.



 

18 Section 4.2 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates._

 

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the
appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership
shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver in
exchange therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the same number and type of
Partnership Securities as the Certificate so surrendered.

 

(b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent
shall countersign a new Certificate in place of any Certificate previously
issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate:

 

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Partnership, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed or
stolen;

(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the Partnership
has notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in
good faith and without notice of an adverse claim;

 

(iii) if requested by the Partnership, delivers to the Partnership a bond, in
form and substance satisfactory to the Partnership, with surety or sureties
and with fixed or open penalty as the Partnership may reasonably direct, in
its sole discretion, to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General
Partner and the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account
of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

(iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Partnership.

If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to notify the Partnership within
a reasonable time after he has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a
Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests represented by
the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the General Partner or
the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the Limited Partner or
Assignee shall be precluded from making any claim against the Partnership, the
General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new
Certificate.

 

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section
4.2, the Partnership may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent)
reasonably connected therewith.

 

(d) In lieu of issuing a new Certificate pursuant to this Section 4.2, the
Transfer Agent may cause Common Units represented by such Certificate to be
uncertificated; provided, that any Record Holder may request a Certificate at
the Partnerships expense.

Section 4.3  _Record Holders._

The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the
Partner or Assignee with respect to any Partnership Interest and,
accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to
or interest in such Partnership Interest on the part of any other Person,
regardless of whether the Partnership shall have actual or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement

  

 

19  of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are
listed for trading. Without limiting the foregoing, when a Person (such as a
broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of
any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other
representative capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding
Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the one hand, and
such other Persons on the other, such representative Person (a) shall be the
Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) of record and beneficially, (b) must
execute and deliver a Transfer Application and (c) shall be bound by this
Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of a Partner or Assignee
(as the case may be) hereunder and as, and to the extent, provided for herein.

 

Section 4.4 _Transfer Generally_.

 

(a) The term "transfer," when used in this Agreement with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which a
General Partner assigns its General Partner Interest to another Person who
becomes a General Partner, by which the holder of a Limited Partner Interest
assigns such Limited Partner Interest to another Person who is or becomes a
Limited Partner or an Assignee, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by law
or otherwise.

 

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IV. Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this Article IV shall be null and void.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a
disposition by any member of the General Partner of any or all of the
membership interests of the General Partner.

Section 4.5 _Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests._

 

(a) The Partnership shall keep or cause to be kept on behalf of the
Partnership a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the Partnership
will provide for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner Interests.
The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer agent for the
purpose of registering Common Units and transfers of such Common Units as
herein provided. The Partnership shall not recognize transfers of Certificates
evidencing Limited Partner Interests or transfers of uncertificated Common
Units unless such transfers are effected in the manner described in this
Section 4.5. Upon surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of
any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the
provisions of Section 4.5(b), the appropriate officers of the General Partner
on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of
Common Units, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of
the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant
to the holders instructions, one or more new Certificates, evidencing the
same aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced
by the Certificate so surrendered. Upon delivery of evidence of the ownership
of uncertificated Common Units and subject to Section 4.5(b), the Transfer
Agent shall deliver in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or
transferees, as required pursuant to the holders instructions, evidence of
ownership of uncertificated Common Units evidencing the same aggregate number
of Common Units as was evidenced by the uncertificated Common Units so
surrendered.

 



 

20 (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.9, the Partnership shall not
recognize any transfer of Limited Partner Interests until (i) if the Limited
Partnership Interests being transferred are evidenced by Certificates, such
Certificates are surrendered for registration of transfer or (ii) if the
Limited Partnership Interests being transferred are uncertificated Common
Units, evidence of the ownership of such Common Units is provided and, in
either case, a Transfer Application is provided and duly executed by the
transferee (or the transferees attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing).
No charge shall be imposed by the Partnership for such transfer; provided,
that as a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate, or uncertificated
issuance of Common Units, under this Section 4.5, the Partnership may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed with respect thereto.

 

(c) Limited Partner Interests may be transferred only in the manner described
in this Section 4.5. The transfer of any Limited Partner Interests and the
admission of any new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this
Agreement.

(d) Until admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.2,
the Record Holder of a Limited Partner Interest shall be an Assignee in
respect of such Limited Partner Interest. Limited Partners may include
custodians, nominees or any other individual or entity in its own or any
representative capacity.

(e) A transferee of a Limited Partner Interest who has completed and
delivered a Transfer Application shall be deemed to have (i) requested
admission as a Substituted Limited Partner, (ii) agreed to comply with and be
bound by and to have executed this Agreement, (iii) represented and warranted
that such transferee has the right, power and authority and, if an individual,
the capacity to enter into this Agreement, (iv) granted the powers of attorney
set forth in this Agreement and (v) given the consents and approvals and made
the waivers contained in this Agreement.

Section 4.6 _Transfer of the General Partner s General Partner Interest._ 

(a) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, prior to September 30, 2011, the General
Partner shall not transfer all or any part of its General Partner Interest to
a Person unless such transfer (i) has been approved by the prior written
consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding
Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates) or (ii) is of all, but not less than all, of its General Partner
Interest to (A) an Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an individual)
or (B) another Person (other than an individual) in connection with the
merger or consolidation of the General Partner with or into another Person
(other than an individual) or the transfer by the General Partner of all or
substantially all of its assets to another Person (other than an individual).

 

(b) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, on or after September 30, 2011, the
General Partner may transfer all or any of its General Partner Interest
without Unitholder approval.



 

21 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion
of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability of any Limited Partner or of any member of the Finance Company or
cause the Partnership or the Finance Company to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii)
such transferee also agrees to purchase all (or the appropriate portion
thereof, if applicable) of the partnership or membership interest of the
General Partner as the general partner or managing member, if any, of each
other Group Member. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance
with this Section 4.6, the transferee or successor (as the case may be)
shall, subject to compliance with the terms of Section 10.3, be admitted to
the Partnership as the General Partner immediately prior to the transfer of
the Partnership Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue
without dissolution.

Section 4.7 _Intentionally Omitted._

 

Section 4.8 _Restrictions on Transfers._

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.8(c) below, but notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Article IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall
be made if such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal or
state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state
securities commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction
over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the
Partnership or the Finance Company under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership or the Finance Company to
be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be
taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already
so treated or taxed).

 

(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership
Interests if a subsequent Opinion of Counsel determines that such
restrictions are necessary to avoid a significant risk of the Partnership or
the Finance Company becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed
as an entity for federal income tax purposes. The restrictions may be imposed
by making such amendments to this Agreement as the General Partner may
determine to be necessary or appropriate to impose such restrictions;
provided, however, that any amendment that the General Partner believes, in
the exercise of its reasonable discretion, could result in the delisting or
suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the
principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner
Interests is then traded must be approved, prior to such amendment being
effected, by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited
Partner Interests of such class.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere in this Agreement,
shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership
Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading.



 

22 Section 4.9 _Citizenship Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees_.

 

(a) If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any federal, state or local
law or regulation that, in the reasonable determination of the General
Partner, creates a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any
property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the nationality,
citizenship or other related status of a Limited Partner or Assignee, the
General Partner may request any Limited Partner or Assignee to furnish to the
General Partner, within 30 days after receipt of such request, an executed
Citizenship Certification or such other information concerning his
nationality, citizenship or other related status (or, if the Limited Partner
or Assignee is a nominee holding for the account of another Person, the
nationality, citizenship or other related status of such Person) as the
General Partner may request. If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to
furnish to the General Partner within the aforementioned 30-day period such
Citizenship Certification or other requested information or if upon receipt of
such Citizenship Certification or other requested information the General
Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or
Assignee is not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership Interests owned by such
Limited Partner or Assignee shall be subject to redemption in accordance with
the provisions of Section 4.10. In addition, the General Partner may require
that the status of any such Partner or Assignee be changed to that of a Non-
citizen Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner shall be substituted for
such Non-citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in respect of his Limited
Partner Interests.

(b) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of
Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees,
distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Partners (including
without limitation the General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner
Interests other than those of Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for,
against or abstaining as to the matter.

(c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be
entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen Assignees share of the
distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Non-citizen
Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive
his share of such distribution in kind).

(d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible
Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner,
request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to any Limited
Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed pursuant
to Section 4.10, and upon his admission pursuant to Section 10.2, the General
Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of the
Non-citizen Assignees Limited Partner Interests.

 

Section 4.10 _Redemption of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen Assignees_.

 

(a) If at any time a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to furnish a
Citizenship Certification or other information requested within the 30-day
period specified in Section 4.9(a), or if upon receipt of such Citizenship
Certification or other information the General Partner determines, with the
advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible 



 

23  Citizen, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner or Assignee
establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Limited
Partner or Assignee is an Eligible Citizen or has transferred his Partnership
Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Citizen and who furnishes a
Citizenship Certification to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for
redemption as provided below, redeem the Partnership Interest of such Limited
Partner or Assignee as follows:

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner or
Assignee, at his last address designated on the records of the Partnership or
the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The
notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall
specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of
payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon surrender of
the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, or if the Redeemable
Interests are uncertificated Common Units, other evidence of such
uncertificated Common Units, and that on and after the date fixed for
redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the Limited
Partner or Assignee would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable
Interests will accrue or be made.

 

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption
price shall be paid, in the discretion of the General Partner, in cash or by
delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of
the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 10% annually and payable
in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued
interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

 

(iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Assignee, at
the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate
evidencing the Redeemable Interests, or, if the Redeemable Interests are
uncertificated Common Units, other evidence of such uncertificated Common
Units, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment duly executed
in blank, the Limited Partner or Assignee or his duly authorized
representative shall be entitled to receive the payment therefor.

 

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer
constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

(b) The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall also be applicable to Limited
Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner or Assignee as nominee of a
Person determined to be other than an Eligible Citizen.

(c) Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the
redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement.
Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw
the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Limited Partner
Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner in a Citizenship
Certification delivered in connection with the Transfer Application that he
is an Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make such certification,
such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the original
redemption date.

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

 

Section 5.1 _Transformation of the General Partner Interest._

 

The 2% general partner interest in the Partnership that existed immediately
prior to the Effective Time is, immediately following the Effective Time,
hereby converted into a non-economic, management interest in the Partnership.
Following the Effective Time, the General Partner Interest shall only
represent a non-economic, management interest of the General Partner in
the Partnership. Penn Virginia Resource GP, LLC hereby continues as general
partner of the Partnership and the Partnership is hereby continued without
dissolution.

 

Section 5.2 _Cancellation of Incentive Distribution Rights._

 

The Incentive Distribution Rights that existed immediately prior to the
Effective Time are, immediately following the Effective Time, hereby
canceled. Following the Effective Time, no Person, in its capacity as a former
holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, shall have any rights with
respect to the Partnership as a former holder of the Incentive Distribution
Rights, including the right to receive any distributions from the
Partnership.

Section 5.3 _Intentionally Omitted._

 

Section 5.4 _Interest and Withdrawal._

 

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No
Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its
Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made
pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be
considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this
Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no
Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Partner or Assignee
either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners
and Assignees agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware
Act.

Section 5.5  _Capital Accounts._

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Limited Partner (or a beneficial
owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to
the General Partner in its sole discretion) owning a Partnership Interest a
separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in
accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).
Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to



 

25  such Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of
Partnership income and gain (including, without limitation, income and gain
exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated
with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and
decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and
deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such
Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all items of
Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and
allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction which is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be
reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including,
without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for that purpose), provided, that:

 

(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.5, the Partnership shall be treated
as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General
Partner based upon the provisions of the Finance Company Agreement) of all
property owned by the Finance Company or any other Subsidiary that is
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. 

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items
described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard
to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To
the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset
pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.

 

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 



 

26 (v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.5(d)
to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be
determined (A) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the
Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment and (B)
using a rate of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization derived from the
same method and useful life (or, if applicable, the remaining useful life) as
is applied for federal income tax purposes; provided, however, that, if the
asset has a zero adjusted basis for federal income tax
purposes, depreciation, cost recovery or amortization deductions shall be
determined using any reasonable method that the General Partner may adopt.

 

(vi) If the Partnerships adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery
property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section
50(c)(1) or 50(c)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost
recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall
be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. Any restoration of
such basis pursuant to Section 50(c)(2) of the Code shall, to the extent
possible, be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom such
deemed deduction was allocated.

(vii) The Gross Liability Value of each liability of the Partnership described
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such
times as provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The
amount of any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item
of loss (if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such liability of
the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the Carrying
Value of such liability of the Partnership).

 

(c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion
of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest
so transferred.

(d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed
Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the
provision of services, the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying
Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall
be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such
issuance and had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to
Section 6.1 in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually
recognized during such period would have been allocated. In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market
value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall
be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may
adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in arriving at such
valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the
Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time. The General Partner shall
allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such
manner as it determines) to arrive at a fair market value for individual
properties.



 

27 (ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market
value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to
Section 6.1 in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually
recognized during such period would have been allocated. In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market
value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual
distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a
deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as
that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating
distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the
Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt.

 

Section 5.6 _Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities._

 

(a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options,
rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership
Securities for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to
such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall
be established by the General Partner in its sole discretion, all without
the approval of any Limited Partners.

(b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to Section 5.6(a) may be issued in one or more classes,
or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the
General Partner in the exercise of its sole discretion, including (i) the
right to share Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii) the right
to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions
upon which, the Partnership may redeem the Partnership Security; (v) whether
such Partnership Security is issued with the privilege of conversion or
exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange;
(vi) the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership Security will be
issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; and (vii) the
right, if any, of each such Partnership Security to vote on Partnership
matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and
privileges of such Partnership Security.

 



 

28 (c) The General Partner is hereby authorized and directed to take all actions
that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance
of Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation
rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section 5.6, (ii)
the conversion of the General Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, (iii) the admission of Additional Limited Partners
and (iv) all additional issuances of Partnership Securities. The General
Partner is further authorized and directed to specify the relative rights,
powers and duties of the holders of the Units or other Partnership Securities
being so issued. The General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply
with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all things it
deems to be necessary or advisable in connection with any future issuance of
Partnership Securities or in connection with the conversion of the General
Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or
guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National
Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Securities are
listed for trading.

 

(d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership.

 

Section 5.7 _No Preemptive Right._

 

No Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with
respect to the issuance of any Partnership Security, whether unissued, held
in the treasury or hereafter created.

Section 5.8 _Splits and Combinations._

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.8(d) the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution
of Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision
or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any such event,
each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as
before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis or stated
as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted retroactive to the beginning
of the Partnership.

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public
accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities
to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution,
subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on
any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy
of such calculation.

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Common Units to the
Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date
representing the new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record
Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures as it may
deem appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such combination results in a
smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership
shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such
new Certificate or uncertificated Common Units, the surrender of any
Certificate, or other evidence of uncertificated Common Units held by such
Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date.

 



 

29 (d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution,
subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or
combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for
the provisions of Section 5.6(d) and this Section 5.8(d), each fractional Unit
shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded
to the next higher Unit).

Section 5.9 _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests._

All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the
requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable
Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability
may be affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

 

Section 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_.

 

For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights
of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income, gain,
loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b)) shall be
allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as
provided herein below.

 

(i) _Net Income and Net Loss_. After giving effect to the special allocations
set forth in Section 6.1(b), Net Income and Net Loss for each taxable year
and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in
computing Net Income and Net Loss for such taxable year shall be allocated to
the Unitholders in accordance with their Percentage Interests.

(b) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period:

(i) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and,
if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and
1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision. For purposes of this Section
6.1(b), each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined,
and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected,
prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section
6.1(b)(i) with respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation
pursuant to Sections 6.1(b)(v) and 6.1(b)(vi)). This Section 6.1(b)(i) is
intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.



 

30 (ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(b)(i)),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a
net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this Section 6.1(b), each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall
be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall
be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to
this Section 6.1(b), other than Section 6.1(b)(i) and other than an allocation
pursuant to Sections 6.1(b)(v) and 6.1(b)(vi), with respect to such taxable
period. This Section 6.1(b)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of
items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly
receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this Section
6.1(b)(iii) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account as adjusted after all
other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made
as if this Section 6.1(b)(iii) were not in this Agreement.

 

(iv) _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Partner has a deficit
balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable period
in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner
is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items
of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly
as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(iv)
shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit
balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations
provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if Section
6.1(b)(iii) and this Section 6.1(b)(iv) were not in this Agreement.

(v) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests. If the General Partner determines in its good faith
discretion that the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in
a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.



 

31 (vi) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(vii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated
among the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

 

(viii) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(c) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be
adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 

(ix) _Curative Allocation_.

 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the
Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in
making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount
of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner
pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated
to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations
and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this
Section 6.1. In exercising its discretion under this Section 6.1(b)(ix)(A),
the General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that,
although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations
previously made. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(ix)(A) shall
only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General
Partner reasonably determines that such allocations will otherwise be
inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.



 

32 (B) The General Partner shall have reasonable discretion, with respect
to each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions of Section 6.1(b)(ix)(A)
in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that
might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all
allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ix)(A) among the Partners in a manner
that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.

 

(x) _Allocations for Common Units._ Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 6.1, the General Partner shall allocate income, gain, loss and
deduction, including without limitation Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss,
for the taxable year that includes the closing date of the Merger in a manner
which is reasonably determined to result in each Unit (including the Units
issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement) having the same Per Unit Capital
Amount.

Section 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes._

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the
Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain,
loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.

 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined appropriate by the
General Partner (taking into account the General Partners discretion under
Section 6.2(c)); _provided_ , that the General Partner shall apply the
principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events.

(c) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof), the General Partner shall have sole discretion to (i) adopt such
conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special
allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including, without
limitation, gross income) or deductions; and (iii) amend the provisions of
this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of
Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y)
otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests
(or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such
conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement
as provided in this Section 6.2(c) only if such conventions, allocations or
amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the
holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and
Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with
the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

 

(d) The General Partner in its discretion may determine to depreciate or
amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code
attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the
extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a

 



 

33  predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or amortization method and
useful life applied to the Partnerships unamortized Book-Tax Disparity of
such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations thereto. If
the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably
be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization
conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in
the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based
upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in
the Partnerships property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such
aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other reasonable
depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the
intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests that would not
have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders
of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests.

 

(e) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and
to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have
been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

(f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the
Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be
adjusted as necessary or appropriate to take into account those adjustments
permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

(g) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall for
federal income tax purposes, be determined on an annual basis and prorated on
a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of
the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of each month; provided,
however, that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of
the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income or loss realized and
recognized other than in the ordinary course of business, as determined by the
General Partner in its sole discretion, shall be allocated to the Partners as
of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of the
month in which such gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax
purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such
methods of allocation as it determines necessary or appropriate in its sole
discretion, to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and
the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

 

(h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner
of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to
the General Partner in its sole discretion.



 

34 Section 6.3 _Distributions._

 

(a) Within 45 days following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to 100%
of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall, subject to Section
17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed in accordance with this Article VI
by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected by the
General Partner in accordance with each Limited Partners
Percentage Interest. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Partnership shall not make any distributions to any
Partner on account of its interest in the Partnership if such distribution
would violate the Delaware Act. 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the
Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs, other than from borrowings
described in (a)(ii) of the definition of Available Cash, shall be applied and
distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, Section 12.4.

(c) The General Partner shall have the discretion to treat taxes paid by the
Partnership on behalf of, or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less
than all of the Partners, as a distribution of Available Cash to such
Partners.

 

(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities; and

(xiv) the undertaking of any action in connection with the Partnerships

Partnership as a member or partner.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Finance Company
Agreement, the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation, each
of the Partners and the Assignees and each other Person who may acquire an
interest in Partnership Securities hereby (i) approves, ratifies and confirms
the execution, delivery and performance by the parties thereto of the Finance

other agreements described in or filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement that are related to the transactions contemplated by the
Registration Statement; (ii) agrees that the General Partner (on its own or
through any officer of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and

other agreements, acts, transactions and matters described in or contemplated

act, approval or vote of the Partners or the Assignees or the other Persons
who may acquire an interest in Partnership Securities; and (iii) agrees that
the execution, delivery or performance by the General Partner, any Group
Member or any Affiliate of any of them, of this Agreement or any agreement
authorized or permitted under this Agreement (including the exercise by the
General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner of the rights accorded
pursuant to Article XV), shall not constitute a breach by the General Partner
of any duty that the General Partner may owe the Partnership or the Limited
Partners or any other Persons under this Agreement (or any other agreements)
or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity.

 

Section 7.2 _Certificate of Limited Partnership._

 

The General Partner has caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the
Delaware Act. The General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to
be filed such other certificates or documents as may be determined by the
General Partner in its sole discretion to be reasonable and necessary
or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation
of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have
limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the
Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the extent that such
action is determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion to be
reasonable and necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file
amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and
do all things to maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a
partnership or other entity in which the limited partners have limited
liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in
which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. Subject to the
terms of Section 3.4(a), the General Partner shall not be required, before or
after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of
Limited Partnership, any qualification document or any amendment thereto to
any Limited Partner.



 

37 Section 7.3 _Restrictions on the General Partner s Authority._

 

(a) The General Partner may not, without written approval of the specific act
by holders of all of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests or by other
written instrument executed and delivered by holders of all of the Outstanding
Limited Partner Interests subsequent to the date of this Agreement, take any
action in contravention of this Agreement, including, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, (i) committing any act that would make it
impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership; (ii)
possessing Partnership property, or assigning any rights in specific
Partnership property, for other than a Partnership purpose; (iii) admitting a
Person as a Partner; (iv) amending this Agreement in any manner; or (v)
transferring its interest as a general partner of the Partnership.

 

(b) Except as provided in Articles XII and XIV, the General Partner may not
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
Partnerships assets in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions (including by way of merger, consolidation or other combination)
or approve on behalf of the Partnership the sale, exchange or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Finance Company
without the approval of holders of a Unit Majority; provided however that this
provision shall not preclude or limit the General Partners ability to
mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or
substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or the Finance Company and
shall not apply to any forced sale of any or all of the assets of the
Partnership or the Finance Company pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other
realization upon, any such encumbrance. Without the approval of holders of a
Unit Majority, the General Partner shall not, on behalf of the Partnership,
(i) consent to any amendment to the Finance Company Agreement or, except
as expressly permitted by Section 7.9(d), take any action permitted to be
taken by a member of the Finance Company, in either case, that would adversely
affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class of Partnership
Interests as compared to any other class of Partnership Interests) in any
material respect or (ii) except as permitted under Sections 4.6, 11.1 and
11.2, elect or cause the Partnership to elect a successor general partner of
the Partnership.

 

Section 7.4 _Reimbursement of the General Partner._

 

(a) Except as provided in this Section 7.4 and elsewhere in this Agreement,
the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as a general
partner or managing member of any Group Member.

(b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other
reasonable basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole discretion,
for (i) all direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on
behalf of the Partnership (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation
and other amounts paid to any Person including Affiliates of the General
Partner to perform services for the Partnership or for the General Partner in
the discharge of its duties to the Partnership), and (ii) all other necessary
or appropriate expenses allocable to the Partnership or otherwise reasonably
incurred by the General Partner in



 

38  connection with operating the Partnerships business (including expenses
allocated to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The General Partner shall
determine the expenses that are allocable to the Partnership in any
reasonable manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion.
Reimbursements pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be in addition to any
reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.7.

(c) The General Partner, in its sole discretion and without the approval of
the Limited Partners (who shall have no right to vote in respect thereof),
may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans,
employee programs and employee practices (including plans, programs and
practices involving the issuance of Partnership Securities or options to
purchase Partnership Securities), or cause the Partnership to issue
Partnership Securities in connection with, or pursuant to, any employee
benefit plan, employee program or employee practice maintained or sponsored
by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in each case for the benefit
of employees of the General Partner, any Group Member or any Affiliate, or any
of them, in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the
benefit of the Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates any Partnership Securities that
the General Partner or such Affiliates are obligated to provide to any
employees pursuant to any such employee benefit plans, employee programs or
employee practices. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection
with any such plans, programs and practices (including the net cost to the
General Partner or such Affiliates of Partnership Securities purchased by the
General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership to fulfill options or
awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in
accordance with Section 7.4(b). Any and all obligations of the General
Partner under any employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee
practices adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this Section 7.4(c)
shall constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and shall be
assumed by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or
11.2 or the transferee of or successor to all of the General Partners General
Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6.

 

Section 7.5 _Outside Activities._

 

(a) The General Partner of the Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business
will be to act as a general partner or managing member, as the case may be,
of the Partnership and any other partnership or limited liability company of
which the Partnership or the Finance Company is, directly or indirectly, a
partner or member and to undertake activities that are ancillary or
related thereto (including being a limited partner in the Partnership), (ii)
shall not engage in any business or activity or incur any debts or liabilities
except in connection with or incidental to (A) its performance as general
partner of one or more Group Members or (B) the acquiring, owning or
disposing of debt or equity securities in any Group Member and (iii) except to
the extent permitted in the Omnibus Agreement, shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, engage in any Restricted Business.

(b) Penn Virginia Corporation and certain of its Affiliates have entered into
the Omnibus Agreement, which agreement sets forth certain restrictions on the
ability of Penn Virginia Corporation and its Affiliates to engage in
Restricted Businesses.



 

39 (c) Except as specifically restricted by Section 7.5(a) and the Omnibus
Agreement, each Indemnitee (other than the General Partner) shall have the
right to engage in businesses of every type and description and other
activities for profit and to engage in and possess an interest in other
business ventures of any and every type or description, whether in businesses
engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in by any Group Member, independently
or with others, including business interests and activities in direct
competition with the business and activities of any Group Member, and none of
the same shall constitute a breach of this Agreement or any duty express or
implied by law to any Group Member or any Partner or Assignee. Neither any
Group Member, any Limited Partner nor any other Person shall have any rights
by virtue of this Agreement, the Finance Company Agreement or the partnership
relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any Indemnitee.

 

(d) Subject to the terms of Section 7.5(a), Section 7.5(b), Section 7.5(c) and
the Omnibus Agreement, but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) the engaging in competitive activities by any
Indemnitees (other than the General Partner) in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7.5 is hereby approved by the Partnership and all Partners,
(ii) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of the General Partners fiduciary
duty or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner for
the Indemnitees (other than the General Partner) to engage in such business
interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the
Partnership and (iii) except as set forth in the Omnibus Agreement, the
General Partner and the Indemnitees shall have no obligation to
present business opportunities to the Partnership.

(e) The General Partner and any of its Affiliates may acquire Units or
other Partnership Securities and, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise all rights of the General Partner or
Limited Partner, as applicable, relating to such Units or Partnership
Securities.

 

(f) The term " _Affiliates_ " when used in Section 7.5(a) and Section 7.5(e)
with respect to the General Partner shall not include any Group Member or any
Subsidiary of the Group Member.

(g) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent
that provisions of Sections 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10 or other Sections of this
Agreement purport or are interpreted to have the effect of restricting the
fiduciary duties that might otherwise, as a result of Delaware or other
applicable law, be owed by the General Partner to the Partnership and its
Limited Partners, or to constitute a waiver or consent by the Limited Partners
to any such restriction, such provisions shall be inapplicable and have no
effect in determining whether the General Partner has complied with its
fiduciary duties in connection with determinations made by it under this
Section 7.5.

 

Section 7.6 _Loans from the General Partner;_ _Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership; Contracts with Affiliates; Certain Restrictions on the General
Partner._

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member,
and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods of
time and in such amounts as the General

 



 

40  Partner may determine; provided, however, that in any such case the lending
party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the
rate that would be charged the borrowing party or impose terms less favorable
to the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party
by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made on an arms-length basis
(without reference to the lending partys financial abilities or guarantees).
The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other
than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in
connection with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section
7.6(a) and Section 7.6(b), the term " _Group Member_ " shall include any
Affiliate of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group Member. No Group
Member may lend funds to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other
than another Group Member).

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any
Group Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
established in the sole discretion of the General Partner; provided, however,
that the Partnership may not charge the Group Member interest at a rate less
than the rate that would be charged to the Group Member (without reference to
the General Partners financial abilities or guarantees) by unrelated lenders
on comparable loans. The foregoing authority shall be exercised by the General
Partner in its sole discretion and shall not create any right or benefit in
favor of any Group Member or any other Person.

(c) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an agreement with any
of its Affiliates to, render services to a Group Member or to the General
Partner in the discharge of its duties as General Partner of the Partnership.
Any services rendered to a Group Member by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership;
provided, however, that the requirements of this Section 7.6(c) shall be
deemed satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii)
any transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership
Group than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third
parties or (iii) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of
the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions
that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership Group),
is equitable to the Partnership Group. The provisions of Section 7.4
shall apply to the rendering of services described in this Section 7.6(c).

(d) The Partnership Group may transfer assets to joint ventures, other
partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions as are consistent with this Agreement
and applicable law.

(e) Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer
or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are fair and
reasonable to the Partnership; provided, however, that the requirements of
this Section 7.6(e) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to (i) any transaction
approved by Special Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms of which are no
less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties, or (iii) any transaction that, taking
into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved
(including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or
advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable to the Partnership. With
respect to any contribution of assets to



 

41  the Partnership in exchange for Partnership Securities, the Conflicts
Committee, in determining whether the appropriate number of Partnership
Securities are being issued, may take into account, among other things, the
fair market value of the assets, the liquidated and contingent liabilities
assumed, the tax basis in the assets, the extent to which tax-only allocations
to the transferor will protect the existing partners of the
Partnership against a low tax basis, and such other factors as the Conflicts
Committee deems relevant under the circumstances.

(f) The General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation to permit
any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and
its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time
to time specifically dealing with such use, nor shall there be any obligation
on the part of the General Partner or its Affiliates to enter into such
contracts.

 

(g) Without limitation of Sections 7.6(a) through 7.6(f), and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the existence of the conflicts of
interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby approved by all
Partners.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification_. 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or
investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee;
provided, that in each case the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner
that such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or (in the case of a Person
other than the General Partner) not opposed to, the best interests of the
Partnership and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe its conduct was unlawful; provided, further, no
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be available to the
General Partner with respect to its obligations incurred pursuant to the
Underwriting Agreement or the Contribution Agreement (other than obligations
incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership). The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not
create a presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that
specified above. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be
made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the
General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and
shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the
Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section
7.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from
time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition
of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the
Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such
amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized in this Section 7.7.



 

42 (c) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Section
7.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be
entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of
Outstanding Limited Partner Interests, as a matter of law or otherwise, both
as to actions in the Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions
in any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased
to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the
General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner
shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expense
that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnerships
activities or such Persons activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 

(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken or
omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of
its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a
purpose which is in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Partnership. 

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification or advancement of
expenses in whole or in part under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee
had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification
applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed
to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

(i) The obligations of the Partnership to indemnify or advance expenses to an
Indemnitee under this Section 7.7 shall be considered contractual obligations
of the Partnership to such Indemnitee, which obligations shall be deemed
vested as of the date that such Indemnitee became an Indemnitee. While any
provision of this Section 7.7 may be amended, modified or repealed, no such
amendment, modification or repeal shall in any manner terminate, reduce or
impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified
or advanced expenses



 

43  by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify or
advance expenses to any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or
relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be
asserted.

Section 7.8 _Liability of Indemnitees_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, the Assignees or any other Persons who have acquired
interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission if such Indemnitee acted in good
faith. 

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 7.1(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to
it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder
either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not
be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the Partnerships business or affairs shall not
be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on
the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that they restrict or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities of an
Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners
to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnitee.

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, the
General Partner, and the Partnerships and General Partners directors,
officers and employees under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior
to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from
or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

 

Section 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Finance
Company Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises
between the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Partnership, the Finance Company, any Partner or any Assignee, on the other,
any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or its
Affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and
deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement, of the Finance Company Agreement, of any agreement contemplated
herein or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the
resolution or course of action is, or by operation of this Agreement is deemed
to be, fair and reasonable to the Partnership. The General Partner shall be
authorized but 



 

44  not required in connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest
to seek Special Approval of such resolution. Any conflict of interest and any
resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed fair and
reasonable to the Partnership if such conflict of interest or resolution is
(i) approved by Special Approval (as long as the material facts known to the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates regarding any proposed transaction
were disclosed to the Conflicts Committee at the time it gave its approval),
(ii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being
provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair to the
Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the
parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly
favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner may
also adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received Special
Approval. The General Partner (including the Conflicts Committee in connection
with Special Approval) shall be authorized in connection with its
determination of what is "fair and reasonable" to the Partnership and in
connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest to consider (A) the
relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement, transaction or
situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest; (B) any
customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical
dealings with a particular Person; (C) any applicable generally accepted
accounting practices or principles; and (D) such additional factors as the
General Partner (including the Conflicts Committee) determines in its sole
discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances.
Nothing contained in this Agreement, however, is intended to nor shall it be
construed to require the General Partner (including the Conflicts Committee)
to consider the interests of any Person other than the Partnership. In the
absence of bad faith by the General Partner, the resolution, action or terms
so made, taken or provided by the General Partner with respect to such matter
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated herein or a breach of any standard of care or duty imposed herein
or therein or, to the extent permitted by law, under the Delaware Act or any
other law, rule or regulation.

(b) Whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby
provides that the General Partner or any of its Affiliates is permitted or
required to make a decision (i) in its "sole discretion" or "discretion," that
it deems "necessary or appropriate" or "necessary or advisable" or under a
grant of similar authority or latitude, except as otherwise provided herein,
the General Partner or such Affiliate shall be entitled to consider only such
interests and factors as it desires and shall have no duty or obligation to
give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, the
Partnership, the Finance Company, any Limited Partner or any Assignee, (ii) it
may make such decision in its sole discretion (regardless of whether there is
a reference to "sole discretion" or "discretion") unless another express
standard is provided for, or (iii) in "good faith" or under another express
standard, the General Partner or such Affiliate shall act under such express
standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed
by this Agreement, the Finance Company Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation. In addition, any actions taken by the General Partner or such
Affiliate consistent with the standards of "reasonable discretion" set forth
in the definition of Available Cash shall not constitute a breach of any duty
of the General Partner to the Partnership or the Limited Partners. The General
Partner shall have no duty, express or implied, to sell or otherwise dispose
of any asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary course of
business. 



 

45 (c) Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict
of interest is required under this Agreement to be "fair and reasonable" to
any Person, the fair and reasonable nature of such transaction, arrangement or
resolution shall be considered in the context of all similar or related
transactions. 

(d) The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the
Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve of actions
by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to
those actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this
Section 7.9.

 

Section 7.10 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_.

 

(a) The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 

(b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as
to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within
such Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively
presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with
such opinion.

 

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers,
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers
of the Partnership.

(d) Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the
Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified,
waived or limited, to the extent permitted by law, as required to permit the
General Partner to act under this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated by this Agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the
authority prescribed in this Agreement, so long as such action is reasonably
believed by the General Partner to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best
interests of the Partnership.

Section 7.11 _Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities_.

 

The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire
Partnership Securities. As long as Partnership Securities are held by any
Group Member, such Partnership Securities shall not be considered Outstanding
for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or
any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise
acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities for its own
account, subject to the provisions of Articles IV and X.



 

46 Section 7.12 _Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates_.

 

(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
(including for purposes of this Section 7.12, any Person that is an Affiliate
of the General Partner at the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later
cease to be an Affiliate of the General Partner) holds Partnership Securities
that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any
successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from
registration is not available to enable such holder of Partnership Securities
(the " _Holde_ _r_ ") to dispose of the number of Partnership Securities
it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under
the Securities Act, then upon the request of the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, the Partnership shall file with the Commission as promptly as
practicable after receiving such request, and use all reasonable efforts to
cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than
six months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall
terminate when all Partnership Securities covered by such registration
statement have been sold, a registration statement under the Securities Act
registering the offering and sale of the number of Partnership Securities
specified by the Holder; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be
required to effect more than three registrations pursuant to this Section
7.12(a); and provided further, however, that if the Conflicts Committee
determines in its good faith judgment that a postponement of the requested
registration for up to six months would be in the best interests of the
Partnership and its Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation or
other event, the filing of such registration statement or the effectiveness
thereof may be deferred for up to six months, but not thereafter. In
connection with any registration pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Partnership shall promptly prepare and file (x) such documents
as may be necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to such
registration under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall
reasonably request; provided, however, that no such qualification shall be
required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would
become subject to general service of process or to taxation or qualification
to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such
jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration, and (y) such documents
as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the Partnership
Securities subject to such registration on such National Securities Exchange
as the Holder shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and
things that may reasonably be necessary or advisable to enable the Holder to
consummate a public sale of such Partnership Securities in such states. Except
as set forth in Section 7.12(c), all costs and expenses of any such
registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.

(b) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of the
Partnership for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee
benefit plan), the Partnership shall use all reasonable efforts to include
such number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such registration
statement as the Holder shall request. If the proposed offering pursuant to
this Section 7.12(b) shall be an underwritten offering, then, in the event
that the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering advise
the Partnership and the Holder in writing that in their opinion the inclusion
of all or some of the Holders Partnership Securities would adversely
and materially affect the success of the offering, the Partnership shall
include in such offering only that number or amount, if any, of securities
held by the Holder which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or
managing underwriters, will not so adversely and materially affect the
offering. Except as set forth in Section 7.12(c), all costs and expenses of
any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.



 

47 (c) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this Section 7.12, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
in addition to and not in limitation of the Partnerships obligation under
Section 7.7, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each
Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and
any agent thereof (collectively, " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any
losses, claims, demands, actions, causes of action, assessments, damages,
liabilities (joint or several), costs and expenses (including interest,
penalties and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), resulting to,
imposed upon, or incurred by the Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly,
under the Securities Act or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in
this Section 7.12(c) as a "claim" and in the plural as "claims") based upon,
arising out of or resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement
under which any Partnership Securities were registered under the Securities
Act or any state securities or Blue Sky laws, in any preliminary prospectus
(if used prior to the effective date of such registration statement), or in
any summary or final prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if
used during the period the Partnership is required to keep the registration
statement current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not
misleading; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is based
upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, such
preliminary, summary or final prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person specifically for use in
the preparation thereof.

 

(d) The provisions of Section 7.12(a) and 7.12(b) shall continue to be
applicable with respect to the General Partner (and any of the General
Partners Affiliates) after it ceases to be a Partner of the Partnership,
during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of such
cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the Holder to sell all
of the Partnership Securities with respect to which it has requested during
such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise filed or
that a registration statement be filed; provided, however, that the
Partnership shall not be required to file successive registration statements
covering the same Partnership Securities for which registration was demanded
during such two-year period. The provisions of Section 7.12(c) shall continue
in effect thereafter.

 

(e) Any request to register Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section
7.12 shall (i) specify the Partnership Securities intended to be offered and
sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such Persons present
intent to offer such shares for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or
method of the proposed offer and sale of Partnership Securities, and (iv)
contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such information and
materials and take all action as may be required in order to permit the
Partnership to comply with all applicable requirements in connection with the
registration of such Partnership Securities.



 

48 Section 7.13 _Reliance by Third Parties_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner and
any officer of the General Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on
behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has full power and authority to
encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of
the Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the
Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner or any such officer as if it were the Partnerships sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives
any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such
Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or
any such officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any
Person dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of the Agreement have
been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act
or action of the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives.
Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of
the Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be
conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or
claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or
instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the
Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed
and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and is binding upon the Partnership.

required for federal, state and local income tax purposes on the basis of the
accrual method and a taxable year ending on December 31\. The tax information
reasonably required by Record Holders for federal and state income tax
reporting purposes with respect to a taxable year shall be furnished to them
within 90 days of the close of the calendar year in which the Partnerships
taxable year ends. The classification, realization and recognition of income,

Section 9.2 _Tax Elections_.

 

(a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation
of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General Partners
determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited
Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for the
purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code, the
General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention
whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner Interest will be
deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited Partner Interests

are traded during the calendar month in which such transfer is deemed to occur
pursuant to Section 6.2(g) without regard to the actual price paid by such
transferee.

Partnership ratably over a sixty-month period as provided in Section 709 of
the Code.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine

50 Section 9.3 _Tax Controversies_.

 

Subject to the provisions hereof, Board of Directors shall designate one

(at the Partnerships expense) in connection with all examinations of
the Partnerships affairs by tax authorities, including resulting

cooperate with the General Partner and to do or refrain from doing any or all
things reasonably required by the General Partner to conduct such proceedings.

other federal, state or local law including, without limitation, pursuant to
Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the extent that the

authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income
to any Partner or Assignee (including, without limitation, by reason of
Section 1446 of the Code), the amount withheld may at the discretion of the
General Partner be treated by the Partnership as a distribution of cash

ADMISSION OF PARTNERS

 

Section 10.1 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

Section 10.2 _Admission of Substituted Limited Partner_.

 

By transfer of a Limited Partner Interest in accordance with Article IV, the
transferor shall be deemed to have given the transferee the right to seek
admission as a Substituted Limited Partner subject to the conditions of, and
in the manner permitted under, this Agreement. If a purchaser or other
transferee does not execute and deliver a Transfer Application, then the
transferor of a Certificate representing a Limited Partner Interest
(including uncertificated Common Units) shall, however, only have the
authority to convey to such purchaser or other transferee (a) if the Limited
Partner Interest is certificated, the right to negotiate such Certificate and
the right to transfer the right to request admission as a Substituted Limited
Partner in respect of the transferred Limited Partner Interests and (b) in the
event the Limited Partner Interest is uncertificated Common Units, the right
to transfer the right to request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner in
respect of the transferred Limited Partner Interests. Each transferee of a
Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee holder or an agent acquiring
such Limited Partner Interest for the account of another Person) who executes
and delivers a Transfer Application shall, by virtue of such execution and
delivery, be an Assignee and be deemed to have applied to become a Substituted
Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner



 

51  Interests so transferred to such Person. Such Assignee shall become a
Substituted Limited Partner (x) at such time as the General Partner consents
thereto, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partners
discretion, and (y) when any such admission is shown on the books and records
of the Partnership. If such consent is withheld, such transferee shall be an
Assignee. An Assignee shall have an interest in the Partnership equivalent to
that of a Limited Partner with respect to allocations and distributions,
including liquidating distributions, of the Partnership. With respect to
voting rights attributable to Limited Partner Interests that are held
by Assignees, the General Partner shall be deemed to be the Limited Partner
with respect thereto and shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of
such Limited Partner Interests on any matter, vote such Limited Partner
Interests at the written direction of the Assignee who is the Record Holder
of such Limited Partner Interests. If no such written direction is received,
such Limited Partner Interests will not be voted. An Assignee shall have no
other rights of a Limited Partner. 

Section 10.3 _Admission of Successor General Partner_.

 

A successor General Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 or the
transferee of or successor to all of the General Partner Interest pursuant to
Section 4.6 who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner
shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective
immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor
or transferring General Partner, pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 or the
transfer of the General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6, provided,
however, that no such successor shall be admitted to the Partnership until
compliance with the terms of Section 4.6 has occurred and such successor has
executed and delivered such other documents or instruments as may be required
to effect such admission. Any such successor shall, subject to the terms
hereof, carry on the business of the members of the Partnership Group without
dissolution.

Section 10.4 _Admission of Additional Limited Partners_.

 

(a) A Person (other than a Substituted Limited Partner) who makes a Capital
Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement or is
otherwise being admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner shall be
admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited Partner only upon
furnishing to the General Partner

 

(i) evidence of acceptance in form satisfactory to the General Partner of all
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the power of
attorney granted in Section 2.6, and

(ii) such other documents or instruments as may be required in the discretion
of the General Partner to effect such Persons admission as an Additional
Limited Partner.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.4, no Person
shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent of the
General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the General
Partners discretion. The admission of any Person as an Additional Limited
Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such Person
is recorded as such in the books and records of the Partnership, following the
consent of the General Partner to such admission.



 

52 Section 10.5 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership_.

 

To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner
shall take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Delaware Act to
amend the records of the Partnership to reflect such admission and, if
necessary, to prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to this Agreement
and, if required by law, the General Partner shall prepare and file an
amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership, and the General Partner
may for this purpose, among others, exercise the power of attorney granted
pursuant to Section 2.6.

(v) A final and non-appealable order of relief under Chapter 7 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code is entered by a court with appropriate jurisdiction
pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary petition by or against the General

withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the General Partner
and its Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an
Opinion of Counsel (" _Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel_ ") that such withdrawal
(following the selection of the successor General Partner) would not result in

purposes (to the extent not previously treated as such); (ii) at any time

be the General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(ii) or is removed pursuant
to Section 11.2; or (iv) notwithstanding clause (i) of this sentence, at any
time that the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least
90 days advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners,
such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the
time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control
at least 50% of the Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner
from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also
constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner or
managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members. If the
General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i),
the holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The Person so elected as
successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general
partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other
Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member. If, prior to the effective date of the General Partners withdrawal, a
successor is not selected by the Unitholders as provided herein or the
Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership
shall be dissolved in accordance with Section 12.1. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.



 

54 Section 11.2 _Removal of the General Partner_.

 

The General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the
Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including
Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates). Any such action by such
holders for removal of the General Partner must also provide for the election
of a successor General Partner by the Unitholders holding a majority of
the outstanding Common Units voting as a class. Such removal shall be
effective immediately following the admission of a successor General Partner
pursuant to Section 10.3. The removal of the General Partner shall also
automatically constitute the removal of the General Partner as general
partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member. If a Person is elected as a successor General Partner in accordance
with the terms of this Section 11.2, such Person shall, upon admission
pursuant to Section 10.3, automatically become a successor general partner or
managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members
of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing member. The
right of the holders of Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner shall
not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion
opining as to the matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any
successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section
11.2 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.

 

Section 11.3 _Interest of Departing Partner and Successor General Partner_.

 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the
General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where
Cause does not exist, if the successor General Partner is elected in
accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or 11.2, the Departing Partner
shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the
departure of such Departing Partner, to require its successor to purchase its
General Partner Interest and its general partner interest (or equivalent
interest) in the other Group Members (collectively, the " _Combined Interest_
") in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such
Combined Interest, such amount to be determined and payable as of the
effective date of its departure. If the General Partner is removed by the
Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner
withdraws under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement,
and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Section 11.1 or 11.2, such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior
to the effective date of the departure of such Departing Partner, to purchase
the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined Interest of
the Departing Partner. In either event, the Departing Partner shall be
entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing Partner pursuant to
Section 7.4, including any employee-related liabilities (including severance
liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination of any employees
employed by the Departing Partner for the benefit of the Partnership or the
other Group Members.

 

For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of the Departing
Partners Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between the
Departing Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after
the effective date of such Departing Partners departure, by an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing
Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on other experts,



 

55  and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If
such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or
other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of such
departure, then the Departing Partner shall designate an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing Partners
successor shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third
independent investment banking firm or independent expert, which third
independent investment banking firm or other independent expert shall
determine the fair market value of the Combined Interest of the Departing
Partner. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert may consider the then current trading
price of Units on any National Securities Exchange on which Units are then
listed, the value of the Partnerships assets, the rights and obligations of
the Departing Partner and other factors it may deem relevant.

 

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
Section 11.3(a), the Departing Partner (or its transferee) shall become a
Limited Partner and its Combined Interest shall be converted into Common Units
pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or other
independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without reduction in
such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of
the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify
the Departing Partner (or its transferee) as to all debts and liabilities of
the Partnership arising on or after the date on which the Departing Partner
(or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes of this Agreement,
conversion of the Combined Interest of the Departing Partner to Common Units
will be characterized as if the Departing Partner (or its transferee)
contributed its Combined Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly
issued Common Units.

 

Section 11.4 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners_.

 

No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;
provided, however, that when a transferee of a Limited Partners Limited
Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so
transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited
Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred. 

ARTICLE XII

 

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

 

Section 12.1 _Dissolution_.

 

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited
Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner
is elected pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2, the Partnership shall not be
dissolved and such successor General Partner shall continue the business of
the Partnership. The Partnership shall dissolve, and (subject to Section 12.2)
its affairs shall be wound up, upon:

 

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in Section
11.1(a) (other than Section 11.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is elected and
an Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in Section 11.1(b) or 11.2 and
such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 10.3;

 



 

56 (b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is
approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or

(d) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets and properties of the
Partnership Group. 

Section 12.2 _Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution_.

 

Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of Withdrawal
caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as provided in
Section 11.1(a)(i) or (iii) and the failure of the Partners to select a
successor to such Departing Partner pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2, then
within 90 days thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the Partnership upon an
event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in Section 11.1(a)(iv),
(v) or (vi), then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within 180 days
thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to reconstitute
the Partnership and continue its business on the same terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement by forming a new limited partnership on terms
identical to those set forth in this Agreement and having as the successor
General partner a Person approved by the holders of a Unit Majority. Unless
such an election is made within the applicable time period as set forth above,
the Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its
affairs. If such an election is so made, then: 

(i) the reconstituted Partnership shall continue unless earlier dissolved in
accordance with this Article XII; 

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then
the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner
provided in Section 11.3; and

(iii) all necessary steps shall be taken to cancel this Agreement and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and to enter into and, as necessary, to
file a new partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership, and
the successor General Partner may for this purpose exercise the powers of
attorney granted the General Partner pursuant to Section 2.6; provided, that
the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a successor General
Partner and to reconstitute and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the
Partnership, the reconstituted limited partnership nor the Finance Company or
any other Group Member would be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal income tax
purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue.



 

57 Section 12.3 _Liquidator_.

 

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is continued under
an election to reconstitute and continue the Partnership pursuant to Section
12.2, the General Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as
Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be
entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved
by holders of at least a Unit Majority. The Liquidator (if other than the
General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days prior
notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of
removal approved by holders of at least a Unit Majority. Upon dissolution,
removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute
Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the
original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders
of at least a Unit Majority. The right to approve a successor or substitute
Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any
such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein
provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XII, the Liquidator
approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without
further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the
powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement
(but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise,
upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth
in Section 7.3(b)) to the extent necessary or desirable in the good faith
judgment of the Liquidator to carry out the duties and functions of the
Liquidator hereunder for and during such period of time as shall be reasonably
required in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to complete the winding
up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein.

Section 12.4 _Liquidation_.

 

The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership,
discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner
and over such period as the Liquidator determines to be in the best interest
of the Partners, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the
following:

 

(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution
in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such
Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the
Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c)
to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously
therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners.
The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion, defer liquidation or
distribution of the Partnerships assets for a reasonable time if it
determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the
Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion, distribute the
Partnerships assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a
sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners.

(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section
12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution
rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent,
conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the
Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as
additional liquidation proceeds.



 

58 (c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge
liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the
Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in
their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all
Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions
pursuant to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable year of the Partnership
during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of
occurrence being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made by the end of such
taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such
occurrence).

 

Section 12.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_.

 

Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as
provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Partnership shall be terminated and the Certificate of
Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign
limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall
be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the
Partnership shall be taken.

Section 12.6 _Return of Contributions_. 

The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to
enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the
Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

Section 12.7 _Waiver of Partition_.

 

To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right
to partition of the Partnership property.

 

Section 12.8 _Capital Account Restoration_.

 

No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance
in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. 

ARTICLE XIII

or the registered office of the Partnership;



 

59 (b) admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of Partners in accordance
with this Agreement;

(c) a change that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, is necessary

Members will not be treated as associations taxable as corporations or
otherwise taxed as entities for federal income tax purposes;

adversely affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class of
Partnership Interests as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests)

requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive,
order, ruling or regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial
authority or contained in any federal or state statute (including the

division of any class or classes of Outstanding Units into different classes
to facilitate uniformity of tax consequences within such classes of Units) or
comply with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National
Securities Exchange on which the Units are or will be listed for trading,
compliance with any of which the General Partner determines in its discretion
to be in the best interests of the Partnership and the Limited Partners,
(iii) is necessary or advisable in connection with action taken by the General

Partnership, or the General Partner or its directors, officers, trustees or
agents from in any manner being subjected to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended, or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, regardless of whether such are
substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed
by the United States Department of Labor;

(g) an amendment that, in the discretion of the General Partner, is necessary
or advisable in connection with the authorization of issuance of any class or
series of Partnership Securities pursuant to Section 5.6;

General Partner acting alone;

(i) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a Merger Agreement

permitted by the terms of Section 2.4;

shall be made in accordance with the following requirements. Amendments to
this Agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of the General
Partner which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion. A
proposed amendment shall be effective upon its approval by the holders of a
Unit Majority, unless a greater or different percentage is required under this
Agreement or by Delaware law. Each proposed amendment that requires the
approval of the holders of a specified percentage of Outstanding Units shall
be set forth in a writing that contains the text of the proposed amendment.
If such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek the written
approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or call a meeting of
the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The General
Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any such
proposed amendments.

 

Section 13.3 _Amendment Requirements_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no provision of
this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units (including
Units deemed owned by the General Partner) required to take any action shall
be amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would
have the effect of reducing such voting percentage unless such amendment
is approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of holders of
Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than
the voting requirement sought to be reduced.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no amendment to
this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited Partner without
its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of an
amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c), (ii) enlarge the obligations
of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the
amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to, the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which consent may be

or (iv) change the term of the Partnership or, except as set forth in Section
12.1(b), give any Person the right to dissolve the Partnership.



 

61 (c) Except as provided in Section 14.3, and without limitation of the
General Partners authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the
approval of any Partners or Assignees as contemplated in Section 13.1, any
amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or
preferences of any class of Partnership Interests in relation to other
classes of Partnership Interests must be approved by the holders of not less
than a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class
affected.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by
Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of
the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single class
unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner
under applicable law.

(e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, clauses (a) through (d) of this
Section 13.3 shall only be amended with the approval of the holders of at
least 90% of the Outstanding Units.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, any amendment to
this Agreement that would have a material adverse effect on any Incentive
Distributions with respect to the Special Members IDR Percentage Interest as
compared to the Managing Members IDR Percentage Interest (as such terms are
defined in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company
Agreement of Penn Virginia Resource GP, LLC, dated as of December 8, 2006, as
such agreement may be amended or restated) shall not be effective without the
prior written consent of the Special Member (as defined therein) of the
General Partner.

Section 13.4 _Meetings_.

 

(a) All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall
be taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. Special meetings of the
Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners
owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which
a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a special meeting by
delivering to the General Partner one or more requests in writing stating that
the signing Limited Partners wish to call a special meeting and indicating the
general or specific purposes for which the special meeting is to be called.
Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within
such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply
with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements or similar
requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of
proxies for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall send a notice of
the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or indirectly through the
Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be held at a time and place determined by the
General Partner on a date not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after
the mailing of notice of the meeting. Limited Partners shall not vote on
matters that would cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking
part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the
Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability under
the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is
qualified to do business. 



 

62 (b) (i) An annual meeting of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units
for the election of Directors to the Board of Directors and such other
matters as the General Partner shall submit to a vote of the Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Units shall be held in June of each year beginning in 2011
or at such other date and time as may be fixed from time to time by the
General Partner at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may
be fixed from time to time by the General Partner and all as stated in the
notice of the meeting. Notice of the annual meeting shall be given in
accordance with Section 13.5 not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior
to the date of such meeting.

 

(ii) The Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units (other than the General
Partner and those Limited Partners holding a direct interest in the General
Partner or any Affiliates of such Limited Partners) shall vote together as a
single class for the election of Directors to the Board of Directors (but such
Limited Partners and their Units shall not, however, be treated as a separate
class of Partners or Partnership Securities for purposes of this Agreement).
The Limited Partners described in the immediately preceding sentence shall
elect by a plurality of the votes cast at such meeting persons to serve
as Directors who are nominated in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 13.4(b). The exercise by a Limited Partner of the right to elect the
Directors and any other rights afforded to such Limited Partner under this
Section 13.4(b) shall be in such Limited Partners capacity as a limited
partner of the Partnership and shall not cause a Limited Partner to be deemed
to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of
the Partnership so as to jeopardize such Limited Partners limited liability
under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership
is qualified to do business.

 

(iii) Solely with respect to the election and removal of Directors to the
Board of Directors, the General Partner, those Limited Partners holding a
direct interest in the General Partner and any Affiliates of such Limited
Partners shall not be entitled to vote Units that are otherwise entitled to
vote at any meeting of the Unitholders. If the General Partner has provided
at least thirty days advance notice of any meeting at which Directors are to
be elected, then the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units (other than
the General Partner and those Limited Partners holding a direct interest in
the General Partner or any Affiliates of such Limited Partners) that attend
such meeting shall constitute a quorum, and if the General Partner has
provided less than thirty days advance notice of any such meeting, then
Limited Partners holding a majority of the Outstanding Units (other than the
General Partner and those Limited Partners holding a direct interest in the
General Partner or any Affiliates of such Limited Partners) shall constitute a
quorum.

 

(iv) The number of Directors on the Board of Directors shall be nine, unless
otherwise fixed from time to time pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
majority of the Directors then in office. Immediately prior to the
effectiveness of this Agreement, the number of Directors on the Board of
Directors was six and, upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, each
person serving as a Director immediately prior to the effectiveness of this
Agreement shall continue as a Director and the Board of Directors shall
contain three vacancies. Until such time as a Triggering Resolution has been
adopted, each Director shall be elected to serve a term of one year to expire
at the next annual meeting.



 

63 (v) This Section 13.4(b)(v) shall become effective upon the adoption of a
Triggering Resolution, and no portion of this Section 13.4(b)(v) shall be
effective unless and until a Triggering Resolution has been adopted. The
Directors shall be divided into three groups, Group I, Group II, and Group
III. The number of Directors in each group shall be the whole number
contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number of
Directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient, then
if such fraction is one-third, the extra Director shall be a member of Group
I and if the fraction is two-thirds, one of the extra Directors shall be a
member of Group I and the other shall be a member of Group II. Each Director
shall serve for a term ending as provided herein; provided, however, that the
Directors designated in the Triggering Resolution to Group I shall serve for
an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of Limited Partners held
immediately following the Triggering Resolution, the Directors designated
in the Triggering Resolution to Group II shall serve for an initial term that
expires at the second annual meeting of Limited Partners held following the
Triggering Resolution, and the Directors designated in the Triggering
Resolution to Group III shall serve for an initial term that expires at the
third annual meeting of Limited Partners held following the Triggering
Resolution. At each succeeding annual meeting of Limited Partners beginning
with the first annual meeting following the Triggering Resolution, successors
to the Directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected
for a three-year term.

 

(vi) Each Director shall hold office for the term for which such Director is
elected and thereafter until such Directors successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified, or until such Directors earlier death, resignation or
removal. If, following a Triggering Resolution, the number of Directors is
changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the groups so as
to maintain the number of Directors in each group as nearly equal as possible,
and any additional Director of any group elected to fill a vacancy resulting
from an increase in such group shall hold office for a term that shall
coincide with the remaining term of that group, but in no case will a decrease
in the number of Directors shorten the term of any incumbent Director. A
majority of the remaining Directors may nominate and elect a person to fill
any vacancy on the Board of Directors (including, without limitation, any
vacancy caused by an increase in the number of Directors on the Board of
Directors). Any Director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an
increase in the number of Directors shall have the same remaining term as
that of his predecessor. Notwithstanding Section 13.11 of this Agreement, a
Director may be removed only at a meeting of the Limited Partners upon the
affirmative vote of Limited Partners (other than the General Partner and
those Limited Partners holding a direct interest in the General Partner or any
Affiliates of such Limited Partners) holding a majority of the Outstanding
Units (other than the General Partner and those Limited Partners holding a
direct interest in the General Partner or any Affiliates of such Limited
Partners); provided, however, a Director may only be removed if, at the same
meeting, Limited Partners holding a majority of the Outstanding Units nominate
a replacement Director (and any such nomination shall not be subject to the
nomination procedures otherwise set forth in this Section 13.4), and Limited
Partners (other than the General Partner and those Limited Partners holding a
direct interest in the General Partner or any Affiliates of such Limited
Partners) holding a majority of the Outstanding Units (other than the General
Partner and those Limited Partners holding a direct interest in the General
Partner or any Affiliates of such Limited Partners) also vote to elect a

Directors or (b) by a Limited Partner, or a group of Limited Partners, that
holds or beneficially owns, and has continuously held or beneficially owned
without interruption for the prior eighteen (18) months, 5% of the Outstanding

the Limited Partner Group must have given timely notice thereof in writing to
the General Partner. To be timely, a Limited Partner Groups notice shall be
delivered to the General Partner not later than the close of business on the
ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding years annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the
date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than
seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the Limited Partner
Group must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public

anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting shall be deemed to be June
30, 2011. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend
any time period) for the giving of a Limited Partner Groups notice as
described above. Such Limited Partner Groups notice shall set forth: (a) as
to each person whom the Limited Partner Group proposes to nominate for
election as a Director (i) all information relating to such person that is
required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors
in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and
in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) such persons written

description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to
the nomination between or



 

65  among any or all members of such Limited Partner Group and/or such
beneficial owners, any of their respective Affiliates or associates, and any
others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, including each nominee,
(iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including
any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, equity
appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned
Units) that has been entered into as of the date of the Limited Partner
Groups notice by, or on behalf of, any members of such Limited Partner Group
and such beneficial owners, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss
to, manage risk or benefit of Unit price changes for, or increase or decrease
the voting power of, such Limited Partners and such beneficial owner, with
respect to Units, (v) a representation that each member of the Limited Partner
Group is a Record Holder entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination, (vi) a
representation whether any member of the Limited Partner Group or the
beneficial owners, if any, intend or are part of a group which intends (a) to
deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the
percentage of the Partnerships Outstanding Units required to elect the
nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from Limited Partners in
support of such nomination, and (vii) any other information relating to any
member of such Limited Partner Group and beneficial owners, if any, required
to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in an
election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The General Partner may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such
proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the General Partner. 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of
this Section 13.4(b)(vii) to the contrary, in the event that the number of
Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the General Partner is
increased effective after the time period for which nominations would
otherwise be due under paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13.4(b)(vii) and
there is no public announcement by the Partnership or the General Partner
naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred
(100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting, a Limited Partner Groups notice required by this Section
13.4(b)(vii) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to
nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the
General Partner not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the
Partnership or the General Partner.

 

(B) Nominations of persons for election as a Director to the Board of
Directors may be made at a special meeting of Limited Partners at which
Directors are to be elected pursuant to the General Partners notice of
meeting (1) by or at the direction of a majority of the Directors or (2)
provided that the Board of Directors has determined that Directors shall be
elected at such meeting, by any Limited Partner Group pursuant to Section
13.4(a) hereof, if each member of such Limited Partner Group is a Record
Holder at the time the notice provided for in this Section 13.4(b)(vii) is
delivered to the General Partner and if the Limited Partner Group complies
with the notice procedures set forth in

 



 

66  this Section 13.4(b)(vii). In the event the General Partner calls a special
meeting of Limited Partners for the purpose of electing one or more Directors
to the Board of Directors, any such Limited Partner Group may nominate a
person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as
specified in the General Partners notice of meeting, if the Limited Partner
Groups notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13.4(b)(vii)
shall be delivered to the General Partner not earlier than the close of
business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th)
day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date
of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors
to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of
an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period
(or extend any time period) for the giving of a Limited Partner Groups notice
as described above. 

(C) (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 13.4(b) shall be eligible to be elected at an
annual or special meeting of Limited Partners to serve as Directors. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the chairman designated by the General Partner
pursuant to Section 13.10 shall have the power and duty (a) to determine
whether a nomination was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 13.4(b) (including whether the members of the Limited Partner
Group or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made
solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as
the case may be, proxies in support of such Limited Partner Groups nominee in
compliance with such Limited Partner Groups representation as required by
clause (A)(2)(a)(vi) of this Section 13.4(b)(vii)) and (b) if any proposed
nomination was not made in compliance with this Section 13.4(b), to declare
that such nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 13.4(b), unless otherwise required by law, if each
member of the Limited Partner Group (or a qualified representative of each
member of the Limited Partner Group) does not appear at the annual or special
meeting of Limited Partners to present a nomination, such nomination shall be
disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been
received by the General Partner or the Partnership. For purposes of
this Section 13.4(b), to be considered a qualified representative of a member
of the Limited Partner Group, a person must be a duly authorized officer,
manager or partner of such Limited Partner or must be authorized by a writing
executed by such Limited Partner or an electronic transmission delivered by
such Limited Partner to act for such Limited Partner as proxy at the meeting
of Limited Partners and such person must produce such writing or electronic
transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic
transmission, at the meeting of Limited Partners.

(2) For purposes of this Section 13.4(b)(vii), "public announcement" shall
include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or other national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Partnership or the General Partner with the Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

 

67 (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.4(b)(vii), a
Limited Partner shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect
to the matters set forth in this Section 13.4(b)(vii); provided however, that
any references in this Agreement to the Securities Exchange Act or the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit
any requirements applicable to nominations pursuant to this Section
13.4(b)(vii) (including paragraphs A(1)(b) and B(2) hereof), and, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, compliance with paragraphs A(1)(b) and B(2)
of this Section 13.4(b)(vii) shall be the exclusive means for a Limited
Partner to make nominations.

(viii) This Section 13.4(b) shall not be deemed in any way to limit or impair
the ability of the Board of Directors to adopt a "poison pill" or unitholder
or other similar rights plan with respect to the Partnership, whether such
poison pill or plan contains "dead hand" provisions, "no hand" provisions or
other provisions relating to the redemption of the poison pill or plan, in
each case as such terms are used under Delaware common law.

 

(ix) The Partnership and the General Partner shall use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to take such action as shall be necessary or
appropriate to give effect to and implement the provisions of this Section
13.4(b), including, without limitation, amending the organizational documents
of the General Partner such that at all times the organizational documents of
the General Partner shall provide (i) that the Directors shall be elected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) terms consistent with
this Section 13.4(b).

 

(x) If the General Partner delegates to an existing or newly formed wholly
owned Subsidiary the power and authority to manage and control the business
and affairs of the Partnership Group, the foregoing provisions of this Section
13.4(b) shall be applicable with respect to the Board of Directors or other
governing body of such Subsidiary.

 

Section 13.5 _Notice of a Meeting_.

 

Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall be given to the
Record Holders of the class or classes of Units for which a meeting is
proposed in writing by mail or other means of written communication in
accordance with Section 16.1. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at
the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means of
written communication.

Section 13.6 _Record Date._

 

For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a
meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the General Partner may set a Record
Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a) the
date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units are listed for trading, in which case the rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern) or (b) in
the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the date by which
Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General Partner to give such
approvals.



 

68 Section 13.7 _Adjournment._

 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII.

 

Section 13.8 _Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes._

 

The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and
noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a
meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either
in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, Limited
Partners representing such quorum who were present in person or by proxy
and entitled to vote, sign a written waiver of notice or an approval of the
holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All waivers and
approvals shall be filed with the Partnership records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner
does not approve, at the beginning of the meeting, of the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except
that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the
consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting,
but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting.

Section 13.9 _Quorum._

 

Subject to Section 13.4(b), the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Units
of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including
Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner) represented in person
or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such
class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners
requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Units, in which
case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of the
Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at
which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding Outstanding
Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Outstanding Units
entitled to vote and be present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be
deemed to constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or
different percentage is required with respect to such action under the
provisions of this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent at least such
greater or different percentage shall be required. The Limited Partners
present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any
action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage
of Outstanding Units specified in this Agreement (including Outstanding Units
deemed owned by the General 



 

69  Partner). In the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners may be
adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote at such meeting (including
Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner) represented either in
person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as
provided in Section 13.7.

 

Section 13.10 _Conduct of a Meeting._

 

The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the manner
of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of
approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote,
the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of Section
13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and the
determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection
with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall designate a
Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a
Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the
records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General
Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and
this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting
of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including
regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and
duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination
of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of
approvals in writing.

Section 13.11 _Action Without a Meeting._

If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an approval
in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners
owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding Units
(including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all the Limited
Partners were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange
on which the Units are listed for trading, in which case the rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern). Prompt
notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited
Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify
that any written ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of
taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership
within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by
the General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all
of the Units held by the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have failed to receive a ballot for the Units that were not voted. If
approval of the taking of any action by the Limited Partners is solicited by
any Person other than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the written
approvals shall have no force and effect unless and until (a) they are
deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner, (b) approvals
sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90
days prior to the date sufficient approvals are deposited with the Partnership
and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the
effect that the exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken
with respect to any particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners
to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business
and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners
limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes
then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the
Partners.



 

70 Section 13.12 _Voting and Other Rights._

 

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Units on the Record Date set pursuant to
Section 13.6 (and subject to the limitations contained in the definition of
"Outstanding" and the limitations set forth in Section 13.4(b)) shall be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act
with respect to matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Units have
the right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or
other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be
references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding
Units.

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Persons account by another
Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing
corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units
are registered, such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in
respect of such Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such
Persons provides otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction
of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be
entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of
this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are
subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

operations at the time of such Merger other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an
Opinion of Counsel that the merger or conveyance, as the case may be,
would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner
or any Group Member or cause the Partnership or any Group Member to be treated
as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an
entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously treated
as such), (ii) the sole purpose of such merger or conveyance is to effect a
mere change in the legal form of the Partnership into another limited

that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and

Limited Partner Interests of such class (as of a Record Date selected by the
General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, days prior to the
Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be published for
a period of at least three consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers
of general circulation printed in the English language and published in
the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall
specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in accordance with Section
15.1(a)) at which Limited Partner Interests will be purchased and state that
the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be,
elects to purchase such Limited Partner Interests, upon surrender of
Certificates representing such Limited Partner Interests, or upon receipt of
evidence of the ownership of uncertificated Common Units to the extent any
Common Units comprising the Limited Partner Interest are uncertificated, in
exchange for payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent as the
Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be required by any National Securities
Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed or admitted for
trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of
Limited Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the records of the
Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been given regardless of
whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the
General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall
deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited Partner Interests to be
purchased in accordance with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to
Purchase shall have been duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to
the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the deposit
described in the preceding sentence has been made for the benefit of the
holders of Limited Partner Interests subject to purchase as provided herein,
then from and after the Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any Certificate
(or evidence of uncertification) shall not have been surrendered for purchase,
all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner Interests (including
any rights pursuant to Articles IV, V, VI, and XII) shall thereupon cease,
except the right to receive the purchase price (determined in accordance with
Section 15.1(a)) for Limited Partner Interests therefor, without interest,
upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates, or evidence of the
ownership of uncertificated Common Units, representing such Limited Partner
Interests, and such Limited Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be
transferred to the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the
case may be, on the record books of the Transfer Agent and the Partnership,
and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner, or the
Partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of all such
Limited Partner Interests from and after the Purchase Date and shall have all
rights as the owner of such Limited Partner Interests (including all rights as
owner of such Limited Partner Interests pursuant to Articles IV, V, VI
and XII).

(c) At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding
Limited Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1
may surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest or
evidence of ownership of uncertificated Common Units comprising all or part of
such Limited Partner Interest to the Transfer Agent in exchange for payment
of the amount described in Section 15.1(a), therefor, without interest
thereon.

deemed conclusively to have been fully satisfied, upon sending of such

any assignment or otherwise. An affidavit or certificate of making of any
notice, payment or report in accordance with the provisions of this Section
16.1 executed by the General Partner, the Transfer Agent or the mailing

Record Holder at the address of such Record Holder appearing on the books and
records of the Transfer Agent or the Partnership is returned by the United

is unable to deliver it, such notice, payment or report and any subsequent
notices, payments and reports shall be deemed to have been duly given or made
without further mailing (until such time as such Record Holder or another
Person notifies the Transfer Agent or the Partnership of a change in his
address) if they are available for the Partner or Assignee at the principal
office of the Partnership for a period of one year from the date of the giving
or making of such notice, payment or report to the other Partners and
Assignees. Any notice to the Partnership shall be deemed given if received by
the General Partner at the principal office of the Partnership designated
pursuant to Section 2.3. The General Partner may rely and shall be protected
in relying on any notice or other document from a Partner, Assignee or other
Person if believed by it to be genuine.

pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings pertaining thereto.

Section 16.5 _Creditors._

 

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, or shall
be enforceable by, any creditor of the Partnership. 

Section 16.6 _Waiver._

 

No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant,
duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such
breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

 

Section 16.7 _Counterparts._

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which together shall
constitute an agreement binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding
that all such parties are not signatories to the original or the same
counterpart. Each party shall become bound by this Agreement immediately upon
affixing its signature hereto or, in the case of a Person acquiring a Unit,
upon accepting the certificate evidencing such Unit or executing and
delivering a Transfer Application as herein described, independently of the
signature of any other party.

 

Section 16.8 _Applicable Law._

 

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of

pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Holding contributed all of the
Membership Interests of the Company to Resource Holdings which, in turn,
contributed all of the Membership Interests of the Company to PVR GP Corp.,
which Membership Interests were subsequently purchased by PVG. Following such
transfer of the Membership Interests to PVG, PVG became the owner of the
entire equity interest of the Company and, at such time, the Membership
Interest held by PVG was the only outstanding Membership Interest of the
Company. Peabody was admitted to the Company as the Special Member prior to

PVG was converted into the Class A Interest, the Class B Interest and the
Economic Interest. Simultaneously with the conversion of PVGs Membership
Interest into the Class A Interest, the Class B Interest and the Economic
Interest, PVG assigned the Class A Interest to the MLP and the MLP was

Interest and the Economic Interest are being transferred to PVR Radnor by

and the Economic Member, and (ii) the MLP hereby transfers the Class A
Interest to PVR Radnor, PVR Radnor is hereby admitted as the Class A Member
and the MLP hereby ceases to be the Class A Member. Immediately following the
Effective Time, the Class A Interest, the Class B Interest and the Economic
Interest are hereby converted into the PVR Membership Interest, PVR Radnor
continues as a member of the Company (designated as the PVR Member), and the
Company hereby continues without dissolution. At the Second Merger Effective
Time, (i) by virtue of the Second Merger the MLP is becoming the sole holder
of the PVR Membership Interest and shall be automatically admitted to the
Company as a member, and (ii) the Company shall be continued without
dissolution with the MLP as the PVR Member and Peabody as the Special Member.

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time and the Second Merger Effective
Time, the members of the Company are (i) the PVR Member and (ii) the Special
Member. At and immediately following the Effective Time and the Second Merger

(a) Subject to Section 3.03(b), Section 18-607 of the Act and Applicable Law,
distributions by the Company shall be made to the PVR Member at the times and
in the aggregate amounts determined by the Board.

(b) Distributions by the Company of any IDR Proceeds shall be made to the PVR
Member and the Special Member, pro rata, based on their respective IDR
Percentage Interests existing at the time of the Companys receipt of such IDR
Proceeds. The Company shall cause the MLP to distribute the Special Members
pro rata share of IDR Proceeds directly to the Special Member Account.

(c) Any distribution that is made by the Company shall be deemed to be a
distribution of IDR Proceeds that is divided among the PVR Member and the
Special Member as provided in Section 3.03(b) until the distributions that
have been made and divided pursuant to such Section 3.03(b) are equal in the
aggregate to the amount of IDR Proceeds that the Company has theretofore
received.

Section 3.04.  _Establishment of Special Member s Percentage Interest_.

(a) A Membership Interest designated as the "Special Members Percentage
Interest" was previously designated and created and is held by the Special
Member.

 

(b) (i) Upon each Special Members Percentage Increase Event, the Special
Members Percentage Interest shall increase by one percent for each $10
million in Coal Assets sold or otherwise transferred to the MLP or its
subsidiaries in connection with such Special Members Percentage Increase
Event, it being understood and agreed that such increase in the
Special Members Percentage Interest shall be the sole and exclusive
consideration for each $10 million of such Coal Assets except to the extent
set forth in the definitive agreements providing for the sale of such Coal
Assets. The value of the Coal Assets shall be determined by agreement of the
Special Member and the Board and set forth in the definitive agreements
providing for the sale of such Coal Assets; _provided, however_ , that nothing
herein shall give rise to any obligation whatsoever of any party hereto or
any of their Affiliates to negotiate or enter into such definitive agreements
or consummate such sale or disposition. The Special Members Percentage
Interest will be evidenced by certificates issued by the Company. The Company
shall increase Special Members Percentage Interest by a fraction of one
percent to the extent that the agreed value of the Coal Assets exceeds a
multiple of $10 million (for the avoidance of doubt, zero shall be deemed
to be a multiple of $10 million for purposes of calculating such fraction),
and the fraction shall be the excess over such multiple of $10 million (or
zero) divided by $10 million. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Company from
increasing the Special Members Percentage Interest in consideration for a de
minimis amount of assets that are not Qualifying Assets purchased in
connection with Coal Assets.

 

(ii) It is anticipated that, during the term of the Leases, the Special Member
may identify to the MLP opportunities to purchase Coal Assets that are owned
by a third party that the MLP is not otherwise considering, and that the
Company, in its capacity as the general partner of the MLP, will consider the
acquisition of such Coal Assets. To the extent the MLP 



 

13  acquires such Coal Assets, the Company will, to the extent, if any, that the
Company and the Special Member so agree, increase the Special Members
Percentage Interest in consideration of the Special Member identifying such
opportunities to the MLP. The determination of whether to acquire such Coal
Assets will be made by the Company in the sole discretion of the Board.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the Special
Members Percentage Interest exceed 40 percent. 

(d) The Special Member shall not sell, assign, transfer, convey, pledge,
hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of (collectively, a " _Transfer_
") its Special Members Percentage Interest without the prior written consent
of the Board; _provided, however_ , that the Special Member shall be entitled,
upon prior written notice to the Board, to Transfer some or all of its
Special Members Percentage Interest to (i) an Affiliate of the Special
Member, (ii) to a financial institution in connection with the pledge of such
Special Members Percentage Interest or (iii) any party in the event that the
Company or its Affiliates do not exercise their redemption rights under
Section 3.04(h) within 30 days of the happening of an event specified in (i)
or (ii) under Section 3.04(h) that gives rise to such redemption right;
provided that such transferee agrees to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 

(e) Except as provided in Section 9.04, the Special Members Percentage
Interest shall not entitle the Special Member or any other Person to vote on
any matters with respect to the Company or otherwise.

(f) The Board shall, from time to time, update  _Exhibit A_ hereto to reflect
any increase in the Special Members Percentage Interest upon a Special
Members Percentage Increase Event and the applicable IDR Percentage Interest
of the PVR Member upon each such increase. The Board shall provide any such
updated versions of Exhibit A to the Special Member promptly upon such
updates.

(g) Upon each Special Members Percentage Increase Event, as a condition to
each increase in the Special Members Percentage Interest in connection
therewith, the Special Member shall execute and deliver to the Company and the
Board an Acknowledgement Agreement in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto.

(h) The Special Members Percentage Interest may be redeemed by the Company
or its Affiliates, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, at
a redemption price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Special Members
Percentage Interest (the " _Redemption Price_ ") payable in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Special Member, if either:
(i) the Special Member or any of its Affiliates delivers an Acceptance Notice
to the MLP or otherwise exercises its rights pursuant to Section 9.1 of the
Purchase Agreement; or (ii) there is a Change of Control with respect to the
Special Member. The Company shall exercise its redemption option by delivering
to the Special Member a written notice (the " _Redemption Notice_ "), in the
case of (i) within ten Days after the MLPs receipt of the Acceptance Notice,
and, in the case of (ii) within twenty days of the Change of Control of the
Special Member, in each case specifying the Companys election to redeem
the Special Members Percentage Interest. If the Company exercises its
redemption option hereunder, the closing of the transaction shall take place,
in the case of (i) contemporaneously with, and shall be conditioned 



 

14  upon, the closing of the transaction contemplated by Section 9.1 of the
Purchase Agreement unless extended for the determination of Fair Market Value
and in such case, five days after the determination, and, in the case of (ii)
within five (5) days after the determination of Fair Market Value unless
extended because of the need to obtain necessary consents or approvals which
the appropriate party is using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain. If
the Company exercises its redemption option hereunder, the Company and the
Special Member shall cooperate in good faith and enter into appropriate
agreements, make (or cause to be made) appropriate deliveries and obtain (or
cause to be obtained) any necessary consents or approvals, in each case to
effect the redemption of the Special Members Percentage Interest.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the provisions of this ARTICLE
III with respect to the Special Members Percentage Interest shall terminate
and the Special Member shall cease to have any rights under ARTICLE III, in
each case automatically and without any action by any of the parties hereto
upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the actual purchase of the Special Members
Percentage Interest by the Company or its Affiliates upon a redemption
pursuant to this Section 3.04 and (ii) if at any time subsequent to the term
of the Leases, the Special Members Percentage Interest is zero or not
outstanding. Upon such termination, the Board shall be entitled to amend or
restate this Agreement to make such changes as it deems appropriate to reflect
such event.

 

(j) Nothing in this Agreement requires the Special Member to make a capital
contribution to the Company.

 

Section 3.05. _Allocations_.

 

(a) Company gross income or gain for the taxable period, if any, shall be
allocated 100% to the Special Member until the aggregate amount of such items
allocated to the Special Member pursuant to this Section 3.05(a) for the
current taxable year and all previous taxable years is equal to the cumulative
amount of all distributions of IDR Proceeds made to the Special Member
from the effective date of the Fourth AandR LLC Agreement to a date 45 days
after the end of the current taxable year.

(b) All other items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated
100% to the PVR Member.

Section 3.06. _Capital Accounts_.  

(a) The Company shall maintain for each Member a separate Capital Account in
accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).
Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of cash and the Net
Agreed Value of other property contributed by such Member to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Company income and gain
(including, without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax) allocated to
such Member pursuant to Section 3.05, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash
or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or
property made to such Member pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all items of
Company deduction and loss allocated to such Member pursuant to Section 3.05.

  

 

15 (b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction which is to be allocated and reflected in the Members Capital
Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item
shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for
federal income tax purposes (including, without limitation, any method of
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose), provided,
that:

 

(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 3.06, the Company shall be treated as
owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the Board based
upon the provisions of the Partnership Agreement) of all property owned by the
MLP.

 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code which may be made by the Company and, as to those items described in
Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact
that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither currently
deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Section
734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall
be treated as an item of gain or loss.

(iii) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Company property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property
as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the Companys Carrying
Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 

(iv) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to
any Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 3.06(d)
to the Carrying Value of any Company property subject to depreciation, cost
recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost
recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined
(A) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value
of such property immediately following such adjustment and (B) using a rate of
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization derived from the same method and
useful life (or, if applicable, the remaining useful life) as is applied for
federal income tax purposes; provided, however, that, if the asset has a zero
adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, depreciation, cost recovery
or amortization deductions shall be determined using any reasonable method
that the Board may adopt.

(c) A transferee of a Membership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion
of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Membership Interest
so transferred.



 

16 (d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
on an issuance of additional Membership Interests for cash or Contributed
Property, the Capital Account of all Members and the Carrying Value of each
Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted
upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
immediately prior to such issuance and had been allocated to the Members at
such time pursuant to Section 3.05 in the same manner as any item of gain or
loss actually recognized during such period would have been allocated. In
determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash
amount and fair market value of all Company assets (including, without
limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of
additional Membership Interests shall be determined by the Board using such
reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt; _provided, however_ , that
the Board, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the
fair market value of the Membership Interests of all Members at such time. The
Board shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Company (in
such manner as it determines in its discretion to be reasonable) to arrive at
a fair market value for individual properties.

 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Member of any
Company property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption
or retirement of a Membership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Members
and the Carrying Value of all Company property shall be adjusted upward or
downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to
such Company property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been
recognized in a sale of such property immediately prior to such
distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been
allocated to the Members, at such time, pursuant to Section 3.05 in the same
manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized during such period
would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Company assets
(including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to
a distribution shall be determined and allocated in the same manner as that
provided in Section 3.06(d)(i).

Section 3.07. _Restriction on Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights_.

The Company shall not Transfer the Incentive Distribution Rights to any party
unless the Company agrees to proportionately adjust the amount of Special
Members Percentage Interest to be issued under Section 3.04(b) upon a Special
Members Percentage Increase Event.

 

Section 3.08. _Cancellation of the Incentive Distribution Rights_.

 

It is hereby recognized that the Incentive Distribution Rights are being
cancelled immediately after the Effective Time. The Special Members
Percentage Interest is, and immediately after the Effective Time shall be,
zero. If there is a Special Members Percentage Increase Event and the Special
Members Percentage Interest is increased above zero, the Company and the MLP
hereby agree that each shall take such actions as are necessary to implement
an appropriate adjustment to the Special Members Percentage Interest or to
otherwise cause an amount equivalent to the amount that would have constituted
IDR Proceeds if the Incentive Distribution Rights had not been cancelled to
be paid to the Company and distributed pursuant to Section 3.03(b) or 8.03(c),
if applicable as if such amount constitutes IDR Proceeds; 



 

17  provided, however, that nothing herein shall give rise to any obligation
whatsoever of any party hereto or any of their Affiliates to negotiate or
enter into definitive agreements providing for the sale or other transfer of
Coal Assets or consummate a sale or transfer that may give rise to a Special
Members Percentage Increase Event or the application of this Section 3.08.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

MANAGEMENT

Section 4.01. _Management by Board of Directors and Executive Officers_.

(a) The business and affairs of the Company shall be fully vested in, and
managed by, the Board, subject to the executive officers elected pursuant to
Article V hereof. The authority of the Board pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall include, without limitation, the authority to approve
matters relating to any merger, consolidation or conversion of the Company,
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the
termination, dissolution and liquidation of the Company. The Directors and
executive officers shall collectively constitute "managers" of the Company
within the meaning of the Act. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, the authority and functions of the Board, on the one hand, and
the executive officers, on the other hand, shall be identical to the
authority and functions of the board of directors and officers, respectively,
of a corporation organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware. The executive officers shall be vested with such powers and duties
as are set forth in Article V hereof and as are specified by the Board.
Accordingly, the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under
the direction of the Board, and the day-to-day activities of the Company
shall be conducted on the Companys behalf by the executive officers who
shall be agents of the Company. The authority to increase the Special Members
Percentage Interest is vested solely in the Board.

 

(b) In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred on the Board
by this Agreement, the Board may exercise all such powers of the Company and
do all such acts and things as are not restricted by the Act or Applicable
Law.

Section 4.02. _Number; Qualification; Tenure; Peabody Designee_.

(a) The number of Directors constituting the Board shall be nine, unless
otherwise fixed from time to time pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
majority of the Directors then in office; provided, however, that if at any
time, pursuant to Section 4.02(c), the Board shall contain the Peabody
Designee, then the number of Directors constituting the Board shall be
increased by one. Subject to Sections 4.02(b) and (c), any vacancy on the
Board may only be filled by a person nominated for election by a majority of
the Directors then in office.

 

(b) (i) Subject to Section 4.02(c), the PVR Member shall be entitled to elect
all of the Directors to the Board, which right the PVR Member hereby
delegates to the Limited Partners as contemplated by Section 13.4(b) of the
Partnership Agreement. The Members and the Company hereby adopt as part of the
terms of this Agreement, and agree to be bound by, Section 13.4(b) of the
Partnership Agreement as if such section were set forth in full herein and
hereby delegate to the Limited Partners holding a majority of the Outstanding
Units (other than the Company and those Limited Partners holding a direct
interest in the Company or any



 

18  Affiliates of such Limited Partners) (the " _Unaffiliated Limited Partners_
") the right to elect (and, to the extent applicable, nominate) the Directors
at an annual meeting of the Limited Partners to be held by the Company in
accordance with Section 13.4(b) of the Partnership Agreement. As a result, the
control of all voting power of the PVR Membership Interest is vested in the
Unaffiliated Limited Partners. Such delegation shall not cause the PVR Member
to cease to be a member of the Company and shall not constitute a delegation
of any other rights, powers, privileges or duties of the PVR Member with
respect to the Company. A Director need not be a Member or a Limited Partner.

(ii) The Limited Partners shall not, as a result of exercising the rights
granted under Section 13.4(b) of the Partnership Agreement, be deemed to be
Members or holders of Membership Interests as such terms are defined in this
Agreement or to be "members," "managers" or holders of "limited
liability company interests" as such terms are defined in the Act. The
exercise by a Limited Partner of the right to elect Directors and any other
rights afforded to such Limited Partner hereunder and under Section 13.4(b) of
the Partnership Agreement shall be in such Limited Partners capacity as a
limited partner of the Partnership, and no Limited Partner shall be liable for
any debts, obligations or liabilities of the Company by reason of the
foregoing.

 

(iii) The PVR Member, the Directors and the Company shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to take such action as shall be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to and implement the provisions of
Section 13.4(b) of the Partnership Agreement as adopted in this Section
4.02(b).

 

(iv) The Board, without the consent of any other Person, shall have the
authority to adopt a resolution providing for staggered elections of the
Directors in the manner set forth in Section 13.4(b)(v) of the Partnership
Agreement.

(c) For so long as Peabody and its Affiliates together own any combination of
Class B Common Units, on an as-converted basis, and Common Units representing
in the aggregate at least 5% of the number of outstanding Common Units, then
Peabody shall be entitled to have one Peabody Designee serve on the Board;
_provided, however_ , that for so long as such condition above is satisfied
and the number of Directors constituting the Board is equal to or greater than
eleven, then Peabody shall be entitled to have appointed to the Board an
aggregate number of Peabody Designees equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (X) one-sixth by (Y) the total number of Directors constituting
the Board (such product to be rounded up or down, as appropriate, to the
nearest whole number and rounded up for 0.50). Any vacancy with respect to a
Peabody Designee will be filled solely by Peabody.

 

(d) For so long as Peabody is entitled to a designee on the Board pursuant to
this Agreement, Peabody, in its sole discretion, upon written notice to the
Board shall be entitled to convert such right into the right to one observers
seat on the Board, _provided_ , that the person serving in such capacity
enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Company. Once converted to
an observers right, Peabody shall in no event be entitled to a designee to
serve on the Board.

registered mail, return receipt requested, with appropriate postage prepaid,
or when received in the form of a telegram or facsimile, and shall be directed
to the address or facsimile number as such Director shall designate by notice
to the Company. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of,
any regular or special meeting of the Board need be specified in the notice of
such meeting, except for amendments to this Agreement, as provided herein. A
meeting may be held at any time without notice if all the Directors are
present or if those not present waive notice of the meeting either before or
after such meeting.

 

Section 4.06. _Action by Consent of Board or Committee of Board_.

 

Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or as otherwise specified in
this Agreement, all decisions of the Board, or any committee of the Board,
shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum, as described in Section 4.08 or 4.10, as
applicable, is present. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
Directors may act without a meeting so long as a majority of the Directors on
the Board or committee of the Board (or such other number of Directors as is
required for such action under this Agreement) shall have executed a written
consent with respect to any Director or committee of the Board action, as
applicable, taken in lieu of a meeting.

Section 4.07. _Conference Telephone Meetings_. 

Directors or members of any committee of the Board may participate in a
meeting of the Board or such committee by means of conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating

constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 



 

20 Section 4.08. _Quorum_.

 

A majority of Directors present in person or participating in accordance with
Section 4.07, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but
if at any meeting of the Directors there shall be less than a quorum present,
a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time
without further notice. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or as
otherwise specified in this Agreement, any act of the majority of the
Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act
of the Board. The Directors present at a duly organized meeting may continue
to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of
enough Directors to leave less than a quorum.

Section 4.10. _Committees_.

the independence and experience requirements as set forth most recently by the
NYSE and the Commission.

 

(c) The Board shall have a conflicts committee comprised of three Directors,
all of whom shall be Independent Directors (the " _Conflicts Committee_ ").
The Conflicts Committee shall review transactions involving the MLP or its
Affiliates that the Board believes may involve conflicts of interest. Any

Partnership Agreement shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable
to the MLP, and not a breach by the Company of any fiduciary or other duties
owed to the MLP by the Company.

 

(d) The Board shall have a compensation committee comprised of the Directors
serving on the Conflicts Committee (the " _Compensation Committee_ "). The
Compensation Committee shall be charged with setting compensation for officers
of the Company and the MLP, as well as administering any Incentive Plans put
in place by the Company.

 

(e) A majority of any committee, present in person or participating in
accordance with Section 4.07, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business of such committee.

(f) A majority of any committee may determine its action and fix the time
and place of its meetings unless the Board shall otherwise provide. Notice of
such meetings shall be given to each member of the committee in the manner
provided for in Section 4.05. The Board shall have power at any time to fill
vacancies in, to change the membership of, or to dissolve any such committee.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Board from appointing one or
more committees consisting in whole or in part of persons who are not
Directors; _provided, however_ , that no such committee shall have or may
exercise any authority of the Board.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS,

 

OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

 

Section 6.01. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Company from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a
party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee;



 

24   _provided,_ that in each case the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a
manner that such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful;
_provided, further, however_ , no indemnification pursuant to this Article VI
shall be available to Peabody or its Affiliates with respect to their
obligations incurred pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or the other
agreements and transactions contemplated thereby. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption
that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified above. Any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall be made only out of the
assets of the Company. 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section
6.01(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from
time to time, be advanced by the Company prior to the final disposition of
such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Company of
any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Section 6.01.

 

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.01 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitees
capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall
continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and
administrators of the Indemnitee.

(d) The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of the Company,
its Affiliates and such other Persons as the Company shall determine, against
any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be incurred by
such Person in connection with the Companys activities or such Persons
activities on behalf of the Company, regardless of whether the Company would
have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the
provisions of this Agreement. 

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.01, the Company shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Company also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 6.01(a); and action taken or
omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan in
the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be
in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be
deemed to be for a purpose which is in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Company. 

(f) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 6.01 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.



 

25 (g) The provisions of this Section 6.01 are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

 

(h) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.01 or any provision
hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past,
present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company, nor the
obligations of the Company to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.01 as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

Section 6.02. _Liability of Indemnitees_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Company, the Members
or any other Persons who have acquired membership interests in the Company,
for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or
omission if such Indemnitee acted in good faith.

 

(b) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Company,
such Indemnitee acting in connection with the Companys business or affairs
shall not be liable to the Company, the Members or any other Persons who have
acquired membership interests in the Company for its good faith reliance
on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that they restrict or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities of an
Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Members
to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnitee.

(c) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.02 or
any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way
affect the limitations on the liability under this Section 6.02 as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.
