of the Membership Interests of the Company to Resource Holdings which, in turn, contributed all of the Membership Interests of the Company to PVR GP Corp., which Membership Interests were subsequently purchased by PVG. Following such transfer of the
Membership Interests to PVG, PVG became the owner of the entire equity interest of the Company and, at such time, the Membership Interest held by PVG was the only outstanding Membership Interest of the Company. Peabody was admitted to the Company as
the Special Member prior to the date hereof. On March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Membership Interest previously held by PVG was converted into the Class&nbsp;A Interest, the Class B Interest and the Economic Interest. Simultaneously with the conversion of
