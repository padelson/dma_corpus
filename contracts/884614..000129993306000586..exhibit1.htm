terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, for itself and each of its
Affiliates (including the Subsidiary upon Closing), hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and releases Seller from all Assumed Liabilities
and all liabilities or obligations relating to the Business or the Assets to
the extent arising from events or occurrences on or after the Closing Date or

       |   |   | Section 2.3. Retained Liabilities.

       |   |   | Section 2.4. Condition on Assignment or Assumption
of Contracts and Rights.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign or assume any Contract or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an
attempted assignment or assumption thereof, without the Consent of a third
party thereto, would constitute a breach thereof. Any transfer or assignment
to Buyer by Seller of any property or property rights or any Contract that
requires the Consent of any third party shall be made subject to such Consent
being obtained. If such Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would affect the rights of Seller
thereunder such that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, Seller
will cooperate with Buyer in any arrangement, including an operating or other
services agreement if reasonably required by Buyer, reasonably designed to
provide for Buyer, at Sellers cost, the benefits under any such Contract or
rights including, without limitation, enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of
any and all rights of Seller against a third party or Governmental Body
thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation by such third party or
Governmental Body or otherwise. To the extent that Buyer does receive all of
the benefits of any such Contract or rights pursuant to the preceding
sentence, such Contract shall be a Contract deemed to have been assigned
or transferred to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be obligated (although Buyer is permitted at its
expense) to provide any arrangement or effect any assignment pursuant to this
Section 2.4 (i) that results in an out-of-pocket cost or expenditure by
Seller, or exposure to or continuation of liability to Seller, resulting from
such arrangements and assignments, that would be reasonably estimated to be
in excess of $350,000, in the aggregate, except as otherwise expressly
provided for by this Agreement, or (ii) where Seller has continuing liability
or exposure due to any third partys failure to release Seller as a result of
such third partys unwillingness to accept Buyer as assignee; provided,
however, that if Buyer, at Buyers option, indemnifies Seller from such
continuing liability or exposure on terms and conditions reasonably
satisfactory to Seller, then Seller shall provide an arrangement
or assignment of the Contract to Buyer.   

       |   |   | Section 2.5. Settlement of Intercompany Accounts.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause all intercompany payables,
receivables and loans between PG Energy and the Subsidiary, on the one hand,

the other hand, to be settled or cancelled.

Agreement, the aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Assets
owned directly by Seller and for the Stock shall be an amount equal to FIVE
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ($580,000,000) in cash (the "Estimated
Purchase Price"), as adjusted in accordance with Section 3.2 (as so adjusted,
the "Final Purchase Price"), plus the assumption by Buyer at Closing of the
Assumed Liabilities.   

       |   |   | Section 3.2. Adjustment to Estimated Purchase
Price.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

(a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Statement"), utilizing the same
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as were
used in the preparation of the Base Statement (and otherwise in accordance
with GAAP, with such exceptions to GAAP as indicated on _Schedule 1.1(a)_)
and shall set forth in reasonable detail the amount of Working Capital of the
Business as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (as well as the adjustments
contemplated in Section 6.8), and a calculation of the adjustment to the
Estimated Purchase Price that is payable based upon the difference
between the Working Capital Target and the Working Capital in the Closing
Statement. Buyer agrees, at no cost to Seller, to give Seller and its
authorized representatives reasonable access to such employees, officers and
other facilities and such books and records of Buyer and the Subsidiaries as
are reasonably necessary to allow Seller and its authorized representatives to
prepare the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with _Schedule 1.1(a)_. The Base Statement was prepared using the
same accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as
were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and otherwise in
accordance with GAAP (and with such exceptions to GAAP as indicated on 
_Schedule 1.1(a)_).   

(b) Following its receipt from Seller of the Closing Statement, Buyer shall
have 15 Business Days to review the Closing Statement and to inform Seller in
writing of any disagreement (the "Objection") that it may have with the
Closing Statement, which objection shall specify in reasonable detail Buyers
disagreement with the Closing Statement. If Seller does not receive
the Objection within such 15-Business Day period, the amount of Working
Capital set forth on the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section
3.2(a) shall be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer and shall become
binding upon Buyer. If Buyer does timely deliver an Objection to
Seller, Seller shall then have 15 Business Days from the date of receipt of
such Objection (the "Review Period") to review and respond to the Objection.
Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the determination of the Working Capital of the Business as
of the Closing Date or the amount of the adjustment to the Estimated Purchase
Price. If they are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect
to the determination of Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing
Date or the amount of the adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price within
15 Business Days following the expiration of Sellers Review Period, they
may refer, at the option of either Buyer or Seller, their differences to
Ernst and Young, or if Ernst and Young declines to accept such engagement,
another internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
selected jointly by Buyer and Seller, which accountants shall determine,
only with respect to the disagreements so submitted, whether and to what
extent, if any, the amount of Working Capital of the Business as of the
Closing Date set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. If Buyer
and Seller are unable to so select the independent public accountants
within 15 Business Days of Ernst and Young declining to accept such engagement,
either Buyer or Seller may thereafter request that the American Arbitration
Association make such selection (as applicable, Ernst and Young, the firm
selected by Buyer and Seller or the firm selected by the American Arbitration
Association is herein referred to as the "CPA Firm"). Buyer and Seller shall
direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to render its
determination within 30 days after the issue is first submitted to the CPA
Firm. The CPA Firms determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer
and Seller. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared
equally by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall make readily available to
the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating to the Closing Statement
and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The Closing
Statement as agreed to by Buyer and Seller or as determined by the CPA
Firm shall be referred to as the "Final Closing Statement."   

(c) In the event of a positive difference between Working Capital on the Final
Closing Statement from the Working Capital Target, Buyer shall pay to Seller
in cash the amount of such difference, plus the Settlement Interest thereon.
In the event of a negative difference between the Working Capital Target from
the Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer
in cash the amount of such difference, plus the Settlement Interest thereon.
All amounts payable under this Section 3.2(c) shall be paid within five
Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing Statement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account in the United
States of America designated in writing by the recipient not less than one
Business Day before such payment.

portion of the Business conducted by it as it is now being conducted, to own
or use its portion of the Assets and to perform its obligations under
all Contracts to which it is a party. Seller has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Related Documents to
which Seller is a party. Each of Seller and the Subsidiary is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and each other state in which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would have a Material Adverse
Effect.   

       |   |   | Section 5.2. Authority Relative to this Agreement
and Binding Effect.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related
Documents by Seller have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.2_ , the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Related Documents by Seller will not
result in (a) any conflict with or breach or violation of or default under
the Organizational Documents of Seller or the Subsidiary, (b) a violation or
breach of any term or provision of, or constitute a default or accelerate the
performance required under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, security
agreement, loan agreement, or Material Contract to which Seller or the
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of the Assets are bound, whether with or
without notice or the passage of time or both, or (c) a violation of any
Order of any Governmental Body, except for such exceptions to the foregoing
clauses (b) and (c) that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or that will be
cured, waived or otherwise remedied on or prior to the Closing Date. This
Agreement constitutes, and the Related Documents to be executed by Seller
when executed and delivered will constitute, valid and binding obligations of
Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their respective terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy or similar laws from
time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or (ii) the availability of equitable remedies generally.

third party is required to be obtained by Seller or the Subsidiary in
connection with the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or the
Related Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Related Documents, other than any Consent the failure
of which to be obtained would not be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Seller has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances
relating to Seller, any Subsidiary or their Affiliates that reasonably would
be likely to preclude or prolong either (i) the receipt of such required
consents or (ii) consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.   

       |   |   | Section 5.4. Capitalization of the Subsidiaries;

Subsidiary does not have, and is not bound by, any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any security of such Subsidiary, including
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. The
Subsidiary is not required to acquire by any means, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, voting rights, equity interests or investments
in another Person, which would constitute a material acquisition or
investment for the Business.   

(b) The Subsidiary does not have any direct or indirect interest in any other
Person.   

       |   |   | Section 5.5. Title to Assets; Encumbrances.

as now being conducted without any known conflict with the rights of others,

individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) Seller or the Subsidiary enjoys peaceful and
undisturbed possession under all material leases of Real Property, and (ii)
to Sellers Knowledge, all such leases are valid and subsisting and in

that is a "reportable transaction" as defined in Treas. Reg. Section
1.6011-4). The only representations and warranties given in respect of tax
matters are those contained in Section 5.9 and none of the

agreements:

diligently to assist Seller in obtaining all necessary Consents required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely manner, including
any Consent required under any Legal Requirement or Contract applicable to
the Business, and all Consents listed in _Schedule 5.3_, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts and act diligently to obtain all Consents
described in Section 4.3 in a timely manner.   

(b) _Access to Information_. After Closing, Buyer will, and will cause

prepare for and participate in any other investigation and defend any
Proceedings relating to or involving Seller, the Subsidiary or the Business
for which Seller may be responsible, to discharge its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Related Documents to which it is a party and for
other reasonable purposes and will afford Seller reasonable assistance in
connection therewith. Buyer will cause such records to be maintained for not
less than seven years from the Closing Date and will not dispose of such
records without first offering in writing to deliver them to Seller;
_provided, however,_ that in the event that Buyer transfers all or a portion
of the Business to any third party during such period, Buyer may transfer to
such third party all or a portion of the books, records, files and documents
related thereof, provided such third party transferee expressly assumes in
writing the obligations of Buyer under this Section 6.2(b). In addition, on
and after the Closing Date, at Sellers request, Buyer shall make available
to Seller and its Affiliates, employees, representatives and agents, those
employees of Buyer requested by Seller in connection with any Proceeding,
including to provide testimony, to be deposed, to act as witnesses and to

shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of the operations of
Buyer and (ii) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the out-of-pocket costs
reasonably incurred by Buyer in making such employees available to
Seller.   

(c) _Seller Guarantees and Surety Instruments_. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining full and
complete releases on the guarantees, letters of credit, bonds and other
surety instruments provided by Seller in connection with the Business or for
the benefit of the Subsidiary, all of which have been listed by Seller on 
_Schedule 6.2(c)_. For purposes of this Section 6.2(c), commercially
reasonable efforts shall include: (i) Buyers assumption of the Contracts on
the terms set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) an obligation on the part of
Buyer to provide a guaranty, letter of credit, bond or other surety
instrument at Closing to the extent required by any Contract assumed by Buyer

days after the Closing Date but effective as of the Closing Date, an
equivalent surety instrument to be substituted for any surety instrument
provided by Seller to any beneficiary in connection with the Business or for
the benefit of the Subsidiary. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates for any and all Losses (in each case
without deduction or set off) incurred on account of Sellers guarantees,
letters of credit, bonds and other surety instruments on or after the Closing
Date insofar as such Losses relate to events occurring on or after

a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby within ten Business Days following the

practicable any additional information or documentary material that may
be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and shall take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Buyer and Seller shall

requests for production of documents and production of witnesses
for interviews or depositions, made by the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, the United States Federal Trade Commission or
the antitrust or competition law authorities of any other jurisdiction (the

clearance from the Antitrust Authorities, or if such clearance cannot be
obtained, to reach an agreement, settlement, consent providing for
divestiture, a "hold separate" agreement, contractual undertakings with third
parties or any other relief with the concerned Antitrust Authority in order
to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts, and
Seller shall cooperate fully with Buyer, to prevent the entry in any
Proceeding brought by an Antitrust Authority or any Governmental Body of an
Order that would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall not oppose any
efforts of Buyer, including Buyers proffer of consent to any Order, to
complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
cooperate in good faith with Buyer and the Antitrust Authorities to the
same effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be required
to agree to any divestiture of or material restriction on, a material
business, a material asset or a material group of related assets that, in any
such case, is owned or operated by it or any of its Affiliates.   

(b) _Other Regulatory Filings_. Buyer and Seller will, as soon as

application to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, prepare and file
with each Governmental Body requests for such Consents as may be necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller will diligently pursue such
Consents and will cooperate with each other in seeking such Consents. To such
end, the parties agree to make available the personnel and other resources of
their respective organizations in order to obtain all such Consents. Each
party will promptly inform the other party of any communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Body from which
any such Consent is required and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any Proceeding by a private party, in each
case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and will permit
the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such
Governmental Body or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party,
with such other Person, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body
or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and to
participate in such meetings and conferences. Neither party shall take any
action in connection with obtaining any Consent from any Governmental Body
that is intended to create, allocate, or shift to the other party any
liability arising from the obtaining of such Consent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither party shall be required to agree to any divestiture of or
material restriction on, a material business, a material asset or a material
group of related assets that, in any such case, is owned or operated by it
or any of its Affiliates.   

       |   |   | Section 6.4. Seller Marks.  
---|---|---|---

marks, trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos incorporating
"Southern Union", "Southern," "SU," and "SUG," (collectively and together
with all other names, marks, trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols
and logos owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the PG Marks,
the "Seller Marks"). shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove from
the Assets any and all Seller Marks and shall amend the relevant
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiary to change the name of the
Subsidiary to a name that does not include any Seller Mark or any name or
term confusingly similar to any Seller Mark. Thereafter, Buyer shall not use
any Seller Mark or any name or term confusingly similar to any Seller Mark in
connection with the sale of any products or services, in the corporate or
doing business name of any of its Affiliates or otherwise in the conduct of
its or any of its Affiliates businesses or operations. In the event that
Buyer breaches this Section 6.4, Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance of this Section 6.4 and to injunctive relief against further
violations, as well as any other remedies at law or in equity available to
Seller.   

       |   |   | Section 6.5. Acknowledgment by Buyer.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

In order to induce Seller to enter into and perform this Agreement and the
Related Documents, Buyer acknowledges and agrees with Seller as
follows:   

THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V OF THIS
AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLER TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND
BY THE RELATED DOCUMENTS, AND THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
COVENANTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR AGREEMENTS, ORAL OR WRITTEN, IN RELATION THERETO
BETWEEN THE PARTIES OTHER THAN THOSE INCORPORATED HEREIN AND THEREIN. EXCEPT
FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V OF
THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER DISCLAIMS RELIANCE ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR ITS
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE
FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS
5.7, 5.11, 5.14 AND 5.21, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
SELLER WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITION OF THE ASSETS, COMPLIANCE WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS OR THE PRESENCE OR RELEASES OF
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IN THE FIXTURES, SOILS, GROUNDWATER, SURFACE WATER OR AIR
ON, UNDER OR ABOUT OR EMANATING FROM ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS OF
SELLER OR THE SUBSIDIARY.   

       |   |   | Section 6.6. Transition Plan.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Within 15 days after the execution date of this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a list of its proposed representatives to a joint transition team,
which shall include individuals with expertise from various functional
specialties associated or involved in providing billing, payroll and other
support services provided to the Business by any automated or manual
process using facilities or employees that are not included among the Assets
or Transferred Employees. Seller will add its representatives to such team
within 15 days after receipt of Buyers list. Such team will be responsible
for preparing as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution date of
this Agreement, and timely implementing, a transition plan that will identify
and describe substantially all of the various transition activities that the
parties will cause to occur before and after the Closing and any other
transfer of control matters that any party reasonably believes should be
addressed in such transition plan, including the matters set forth on
_Exhibit 6.6_. Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their Representatives on such transition team to cooperate
in good faith and take all reasonable steps necessary to develop a mutually
acceptable transition plan by no later than 60 days after the date of this
Agreement. The terms and conditions governing such transition activities will
be more fully set forth in a transition agreement reasonably satisfactory to
the parties, including the matters set forth on _Exhibit 6.6_, to be
executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller at the Closing.   

       |   |   | Section 6.7. Purchase of Leased Assets.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for
Buyer, on the Closing Date, to enter into new lease agreements covering the
equipment listed on _Schedule 6.7_ and leased by the lessors to Seller and/or
the Subsidiary as identified on _Schedule 6.7_ (the "Leased Assets"), or if
unable to do so, then for Buyer to purchase any Leased Assets directly from
any such lessor on, or promptly after, the Closing Date upon Buyers payment
directly to any lessor of the purchase price for any of the Leased Assets
under the applicable lease. In either case, Buyer shall be responsible for,
and shall pay any related transfer, registration, sales tax and similar fees,
including expenses of counsel, if any, associated with any such
lease arrangement or any transfer arising therefrom.   

       |   |   | Section 6.8. Meter Reading.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

On and prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall read the customer meters in
their normal cycle and in due course render the related bills to its
customers served by the Business. Seller shall also read each transportation
customer meter (collectively, "Large Volume Meters") on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with the last meter
reading from each of the Large Volume Meters made on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date as soon as practicable after the Closing Date.
After the Closing Date, Buyer shall read the customer meters for their first
time, in the normal cycle, and in due course render bills for service
during the period between Sellers last reading in the normal cycle and
Buyers first reading in the normal cycle to the customers. Buyer shall
determine the volume of gas sold by Seller prior to the Closing Date through
Large Volume Meters by Sellers meter readings on the day
immediately preceding Closing Date. Buyer shall determine by allocation the
volumes of gas sold by Seller through all meters other than Large Volume
Meters, prior to the Closing Date, and the gas sold by Seller, on and after
the Closing Date and prior to its first meter reading through meters
without charts. Such allocation shall be consistent with Sellers past
practices for unbilled revenues. Once such determinations have been made by
Buyer, the estimated amounts of accounts receivable and earned but unbilled
revenue and any other related payables or liabilities shall be adjusted
based upon such determinations for purposes of the Working Capital
adjustment.   

       |   |   | Section 6.9. Insurance.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

(a) At Buyers request, Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to assert and diligently pursue all rights to insurance coverage under the
Policies (other than with respect to Workmans Compensation and punitive
damage policies) and any other past insurance policies of Seller relating to
the Business or the Assets (such insurance policies shall collectively
be referred to herein as the "Insurance Policies") with respect to insured
claims asserted prior to the Closing for matters included in the Assumed
Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(v). Seller shall remit to Buyer all
insurance proceeds obtained after Closing with respect to such
insured claims. Furthermore, Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate with each of its insurance companies in order to provide
Buyer the benefit of the coverage under the policies for all claims asserted
on or after the Closing Date and to cooperate with Buyer with any efforts to
obtain "tail" coverage, at Buyers sole cost, with respect to any "claims made
policies." Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any recovery of
insurance proceeds by Buyer shall be net of all Sellers cost and expenses.
Seller shall give access to Buyer to all of the non-privileged information
relating to these matters and shall consult with Buyer on the
progress thereof from time to time.   

(b) After the Closing, Buyers shall be responsible for, and neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any responsibility for, the payment of any
deductible amounts or underlying limits attributable to the Insurance
Policies. Buyer acknowledges that certain of the Insurance Policies may
require Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide an indemnity to the
insurance carrier for deductible amounts and to provide collateral to secure
such indemnity obligations. Buyer shall enter into an indemnification
agreement in form mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller wherein Buyer
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller or any of its Affiliates (as
applicable) for any and all of the costs of maintaining such collateral and
for any charges made against such collateral or indemnification payments in
connection with claims arising or alleged to arise from the operations of the
Business required to be paid by Seller of any of its Affiliates
(as applicable) under or with respect to such Insurance Policies from and
after the Closing Date.   

(c) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to the
applicability, validity or adequacy of any Insurance Policies, and Seller
shall not be responsible to Buyer or any of its Affiliates for the failure of
any insurer to pay under such Insurance Policy.   

(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to provide or shall be construed as
providing a benefit or release to any insurer or claims service organization
of any obligation under any Insurance Policy. Nothing herein shall be
construed as creating or permitting any insurer or claims service
organization the right of subrogation against Seller or Buyer or any of
their Affiliates in respect of payments made by one to the other under any
Insurance Policy.   

       |   |   | Section 6.10. Risk of Loss.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The risk of any loss, damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation of any
of the Assets from any cause whatsoever shall be borne by Seller at all times
prior to the Closing, and by Buyer at all times thereafter. If any such loss,
damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation occurs, Seller shall apply
the proceeds of any insurance policy, judgment or award with respect thereto
to impair, replace or restore the Assets as soon as possible to their prior
condition; provided, however, anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Seller shall not be obligated to expend sums in
excess of the proceeds of any insurance policy, judgment or award with
respect to any loss, damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation of any
of the Assets in order to repair, replace or restore such Assets to their
prior condition. The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall apply in the event
("Casualty Event") of any damage or destruction to the Assets which would
result in the nonoccurrence of a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to
consummate this Agreement. If a Casualty Event shall occur, Buyer at its
option, may proceed to close this Agreement on the Closing Date, in which
event Seller shall pay or assign to Buyer the proceeds from any insurance
policies covering Assets subject to the Casualty Event to the extent such
proceeds are received by or payable to Seller and have not been used in or
committed to the restoration or replacement of Assets subject to the Casualty
Event as of the Closing Date.   

       |   |   | Section 6.11. Rate Matters.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Seller has advised Buyer that Seller intends, except to the extent otherwise
mutually agreed to by Seller and Buyer, to file a rate case with the PA PUC
on or about March 15, 2006. Seller agrees to prosecute diligently such rate
case without regard to the pendency of this transaction to pursue the full
amount to which Seller shall be lawfully entitled. Without limiting the
provisions of Section 6.1(b), Seller shall give Buyer access to all
information relating to the rate case and shall permit Buyer to consult with
Seller and its counsel on the progress thereof from time to time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have discretion to conduct such
proceeding in the manner consistent with the foregoing standards, but Seller
shall not settle or compromise such proceeding without the prior written
consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.   

       |   |   | Section 6.12. Outstanding Payments and Bank
Accounts.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (a) all of the
bank accounts and lock boxes of Seller used in or in connection with the
Business shall be considered "Assets" for the purposes of this Agreement and
shall be transferred to Buyer at the Closing, (b) any checks that are in the
possession of Seller at the Closing that relate to accounts receivable (or
any other asset) included in the Assets shall be transferred to Buyer at the
Closing and (c) any checks that are in the possession of Seller at the
Closing that relate to accounts receivable (or any other asset) not included
in the Assets shall be retained by Seller.   

(b) From and after the Closing, (a) if Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives or collects any funds relating to any accounts receivable (or any
other asset) included in the Assets, Seller or its Affiliates shall remit any
such amounts to Buyer as promptly as practicable but no later than ten (10)
days after Seller or any of its Affiliates receives such sum, and (b) Seller
and its Affiliates shall promptly forward all mail, remittance, receipts or
other mailings received by any of them relating to the Business to
Buyer.   

       |   |   | Section 6.13. Preparation of Audited Financial
Statements of the Business.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

If requested by Buyer, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Business as of December 31, 2004 and 2005
and audited consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Business
for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2004, the 6-month period ended
December 31, 2004 and the 12-month period ended December 31, 2005 (such
audited balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows, the "Audited
Financials"). If so requested, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver the Audited Financials to Buyer by the later of (i) the
Closing Date or (ii) September 30, 2006. The Audited Financials shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, and shall be accompanied by the unqualified
opinion of the auditors of the Business. Seller shall consult with Buyer on a
regular basis regarding the preparation of the Audited Financials, and Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for the auditing fees and expenses of Sellers
external auditor relating to the preparation of the Audited
Financials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek a waiver from the SEC to minimize or reduce, to
the extent practicable, its obligation to provide such Audited Financials in
connection with its public filings or offerings and (ii) Sellers
requirement to deliver such Audited Financial Statements shall not be a
condition to Closing.   

       |   |   | Section 6.14. Collective Bargaining Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Seller has advised Buyer that Seller intends to negotiate a renewal or
extension of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between PG Energy and
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, Scranton and
Carbondale Operating Areas, including Mid Valley Local Union #2244 (the
"CBA"). Seller agrees to negotiate such renewal or extension diligently to
achieve commercially reasonable terms and conditions consistent with past
practice. Seller shall give Buyer access to all information relating to the
CBA renewal or extension and shall permit Buyer to consult with Seller and
its counsel on the progress thereof from time to time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller shall have discretion to conduct such negotiations in
the manner consistent with the foregoing standards, but Seller shall not
enter into such renewal or extension without the prior written consent of
Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

accordance with the applicable Legal Requirement) by Final Order and other
Persons that are required in order to consummate the transactions

would not have a Material Adverse Effect, which Consents of Governmental
Bodies shall contain no condition which could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Assets or the Business or the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates.   

(e) _HSR Act_. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby shall have expired or have been

(i) _Retained Indebtedness Encumbrances_. All Encumbrances on the Assets or
the Business relating to the Retained Indebtedness shall have been terminated
or otherwise released in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

the case may be, shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the
provisions of Article VII. The date of the Closing is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date." The transactions to be consummated on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to have been consummated as of 12:01 a.m., local

(a) _Bill of Sale_. Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver a bill of sale
and assignment and assumption agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to
the parties.   

(b) _Stock Certificates; Resignations; FIRPTA_. Seller shall deliver to

to or registered in the name of Buyer or its nominees or accompanied by
separate stock powers duly and validly executed by Seller, (ii) letters of
resignation, effective as of the Closing Date, from each director and each

provisions of this Agreement, Seller (or the appropriate Affiliate of Seller)
and Buyer shall execute and deliver such other Related Documents and shall
obtain and deliver such other certificates reasonably requested by a party
that are necessary in order to satisfy any applicable Legal
Requirements relating to the transfer of the Assets or the Stock to Buyer or
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this clause (d) shall obligate Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
to execute or deliver any document that affects, in a manner adverse
to Seller, Sellers liability to Buyer as expressed herein.   

ARTICLE IX.    

TERMINATION    

       |   |   | Section 9.1. Termination Rights.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement may be terminated in its entirety at any time prior to the
Closing:   

(a) By the mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;   

(b) By Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, in writing if
there shall be in effect a nonappealable Order prohibiting, enjoining or
restricting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   

(c) By Buyer, upon the breach in any material respect of any of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained herein or the failure by
Seller to perform and comply in any material respect with any of the
agreements and obligations required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by Seller, provided that all such breaches or failures are
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and are not cured or
otherwise addressed by Seller in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer
within 30 days of Sellers receipt of a written notice from Buyer that such
breaches or failures have occurred (or significant efforts have not been
commenced to cure such misrepresentations or breaches if they are susceptible
to cure but not capable of being cured within such 30 days);   

(d) By Seller, upon the breach in any material respect of any of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein or the failure by
Buyer to perform and comply in any material respect with any of the
agreements and obligations required by this Agreement to be performed
or complied with by Buyer, provided that such breach or failure is not cured
or otherwise addressed by Buyer in a manner reasonably acceptable to Seller
within 30 days of Buyers receipt of a written notice from Seller that such a
breach or failure has occurred (or significant efforts have not
been commenced to cure such misrepresentation or breach if it is susceptible
to cure but not capable of being cured within such 30 days);   

(e) By either party in writing if the Closing has not occurred by August 25,
2006 (the "Upset Date"); _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) will not be available to any party
that is in material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein; and provided further that in the event either
partys conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Sections 7.1(d) or
7.1(e) or Sections 7.2(d) or 7.2(e) have not been satisfied prior to the
Upset Date but are reasonably capable of being satisfied thereafter, then
either party may request from the other up to four extensions of thirty days
each following written notice to the other; or   

(f) By Seller, if at Closing Buyer fails to make the payments required to be
made by Buyer at Closing.   

       |   |   | Section 9.2. Limitation on Right to Terminate;
Effect of Termination.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

(a) A party shall not be allowed to exercise any right of termination pursuant
to Section 9.1 if the event giving rise to the termination right shall be due
to the willful failure of such party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe in any material respect any of the covenants or agreements
hereunder to be performed or observed by such party.   

(b) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted under Section 9.1, such
termination shall be without liability of or to any party to this Agreement,
or any shareholder or Representative of such party; _provided, however,_ that
if such termination shall result from the willful failure of any party to
fulfill a condition to the performance of any other party or to perform a
covenant of this Agreement or from a material and willful breach by any party
to this Agreement (it being understood that the failure to cure a breach
shall not, by itself, be a willful breach of this Agreement), then such party
shall (subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.2(b)) be fully liable
for any and all damages sustained or incurred by the other party. If prior to
Closing either party to this Agreement resorts to legal proceedings to
enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party in such proceedings shall be
entitled to recover all costs incurred by such party including reasonable
attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to which such party may
be entitled; _provided, however,_ and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall either party be entitled to
receive any punitive, exemplary, special, remote, speculative, indirect or
consequential damages (including any damages on account of lost profits
or opportunities).   

ARTICLE X.    

EMPLOYEE MATTERS    

       |   |   | Section 10.1. Employee Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The parties have addressed the transfer of employees and employee benefit
matters in a separate agreement, entitled Employee Agreement, executed and
delivered of even date herewith, the terms and provisions of which agreement
are incorporated into this Agreement as if fully set forth herein and a copy
of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit 10.1_ (the "Employee
Agreement").   

ARTICLE XI.    

TAX MATTERS    

       |   |   | Section 11.1. Purchase Price Allocation.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Within 180 days after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use their good
faith efforts to agree upon the allocation (the "Allocation") of the Purchase
Price to the individual assets or classes of assets within the meaning of
Section 1060 of the IRC. If Buyer and Seller agree to such Allocation, Buyer
and Seller covenant and agree that (a) the values assigned to the assets by
the parties mutual agreement shall be conclusive and final for all purposes,
and (b) neither Buyer nor Seller will take any position before any
Governmental Body or in any Proceeding that is in any way inconsistent with
such Allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer and Seller cannot
agree to an Allocation, Buyer and Seller covenant and agree to file, and to
cause their respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and schedules
thereto (including, for example, amended returns, claims for refund, and
those returns and forms required under Section 1060 of the IRC and
any Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder) consistent with each of such
partys good faith Allocations, unless otherwise required because of a change
in any Legal Requirement.   

       |   |   | Section 11.2. Cooperation with Respect to Like-Kind
Exchange.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Buyer agrees that Seller may, at Sellers election prior to the Closing Date,
direct that all or a portion of the Purchase Price be delivered to a
"qualified intermediary" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)
 (g)(4)) in order to enable Sellers relinquishment of the Assets to qualify
as part of a like-kind exchange of property covered by Section 1031 of the
IRC. If Seller so elects, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller (but without
being required to incur any out-of-pocket costs in the course thereof) in
connection with Sellers efforts to effect such like-kind exchange, which
cooperation shall include, without limitation, taking such actions as Seller
requests in order to enable Seller to qualify such transfer as part of a like-
kind exchange of property covered by Section 1031 of the IRC (including any
actions required to facilitate the use of a "qualified intermediary"), and
Buyer agrees that Seller may assign all or part of its rights and delegate
all or part of its obligations under this Agreement to a person or
entity acting as a qualified intermediary to qualify the transfer of the
Assets as part of a like-kind exchange of property covered by Section 1031 of
the IRC. Buyer and Seller agree in good faith to use reasonable efforts to
coordinate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any
other transactions engaged in by either Buyer or Seller; provided that such
efforts are not required to include an unreasonable delay in the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

       |   |   | Section 11.3. Transaction Taxes.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

All transfer, documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use, registration,
stamp and other similar taxes, fees and expenses (including, but not limited
to, all applicable stock transfer, real estate transfer or gains Taxes and
including any penalties, interest and additions to such tax) ("Transaction
Taxes") incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by Buyer, to the extent that
Buyer is legally obligated to pay such Transaction Taxes, and shall be borne
by Seller, to the extent Seller is legally obligated to pay such Transaction
Taxes, regardless of whether the tax authority seeks to collect such
Taxes from Seller or Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in timely making
and filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions
of laws relating to such Transaction Taxes. Seller shall prepare all tax
filings related to any Transaction Taxes. Fifteen days prior to making such
filings, Seller shall provide to Buyer Sellers work papers for Buyers review
and approval. Ten days prior to the filing date, Buyer shall provide to
Seller approval of such work papers. Buyer shall also be responsible for (a)
administering the payment of such Transaction Taxes, (b) defending or
pursuing any proceedings related thereto and (c) paying any expenses related
thereto. Seller shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of any proposed
adjustment or assessment of any Transaction Taxes with respect to the
transaction, or of any examination of said transaction in a sales, use,
transfer or similar tax audit. In any proceedings, whether formal
or informal, Seller shall permit Buyer to participate and control the defense
of such proceeding and shall take all actions and execute all documents
required to allow such participation. Seller shall not negotiate a settlement
or compromise of any Transaction Taxes without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   

       |   |   | Section 11.4. Real and Personal Property Taxes.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

All real (including public utility realty tax) and personal property Taxes and
assessments arising with respect to the Assets and the assets of Subsidiary,
and including for this purpose the Pennsylvania Utility Real Property Tax
("PURTA") and any similar utility Taxes of any other jurisdiction shall be
prorated between Buyer and Seller based on the relative periods of time
the Assets were owned by each respective party or their respective Affiliates
during the fiscal period for which such Taxes are imposed by the applicable
taxing jurisdiction (as such fiscal period is or may be reflected on the bill
rendered by such taxing jurisdiction, but in the case of Taxes imposed based
on the specific day of ownership of assets, a fiscal period shall be deemed to
be the 365 day period ending with such date). Upon receipt by Buyer of the
tax bill, invoice or other statement regarding such real and personal
property Taxes, Buyer shall calculate the _pro rata_ share of such tax bill,
invoice or other statement attributable to Buyer and Seller. Buyer then shall
forward, as soon as practicable, to Seller a copy of such tax bill, invoice
or statement along with the supporting documentation relating to the
calculation of the _pro rata_ share to Seller. Seller then shall forward to
Buyer payment in immediately available funds of its _pro rata_ share of such
Taxes as soon as practicable in advance of the due date of the tax bill,
invoice or statement and in time to avoid the incurrence of penalties or
interest. Upon its receipt of such payment, Buyer will pay the full amount of
the tax bill, invoice or statement to the applicable taxing authority. In
the event Seller first receives a tax bill, invoice or statement relating to
the Assets from a taxing authority, Seller shall immediately forward such tax
bill, invoice or statement to Buyer.   

       |   |   | Section 11.5. Other Taxes.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Except as otherwise provided in Sections 11.3 and 11.4, Seller shall be
responsible for (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of Seller and its
Subsidiary for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"),
(ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which Seller or any its Subsidiary (or any predecessor of
any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or
similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes
of any Person (other than Seller and its Subsidiary) imposed on Seller or its
Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law,
rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
on or before the Closing, and (iv) any Taxes of Seller that do not relate to
the Business or the Assets purchased pursuant to this Agreement.   

       |   |   | Section 11.6. Straddle Period.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of Seller and its Subsidiary for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
Seller or its Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of Seller and its
Subsidiary for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.   

       |   |   | Section 11.7. Cooperation on Tax Matters.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Buyer, the Seller and its Subsidiary shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article XI and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.   

ARTICLE XII.    

INDEMNIFICATION    

       |   |   | Section 12.1. Indemnification by Seller.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

From and after Closing and subject to the other provisions of this Article
XII, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Representatives,
Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by a
Buyer Indemnitee, and directly resulting from:   

(a) any representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement not
being true and correct when made or when required by this Agreement to be
true and correct, or any breach or default by Seller in the performance of
its covenants, agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or the
Employee Agreement required to be performed prior to Closing;   

(b) any breach or default by Seller in the performance of its covenants,
agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or the Employee Agreement
required to be performed after Closing;   

(c) Sellers failure to perform or satisfy any of the Retained Liabilities and
all liabilities associated with the Excluded Assets; and   

(d) any amount required to be reimbursed by the Business to Chambers
Development Company, Inc. ("Chambers") pursuant to the third paragraph in
Section 4.1 of the Gas Main Extension Deposit Agreement, dated November 22,
2005, between Chambers and the Business (the "Main Extension Agreement") (and
any similar successor provision thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall not be liable to the Business for any liabilities or losses
under this Section 12.1(d) for any reimbursements of Project Costs pursuant
to the third paragraph in Section 4.1 of the Main Extension Agreement caused
by the action or inaction or the Businesss or Business failure to deliver
landfill gas in breach of the Firm Transportation Agreement (the
"Transportation Agreement") between the Business and PEI Power
Corporation.   

       |   |   | Section 12.2. Indemnification by Buyer.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

From and after Closing and subject to the other provisions of this Article
XII, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Representatives,
Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by a
Seller Indemnitee, and directly resulting from:   

(a) any representations and warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement not
being true and correct when made or when required by this Agreement to be
true and correct, or any breach or default by Buyer in the performance of its
covenants, agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or the Employee
Agreement required to be performed prior to Closing;   

(b) any breach or default by Buyer in the performance of its covenants,
agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or the Employee Agreement
required to be performed after Closing; and   

(c) the Assumed Liabilities.   

       |   |   | Section 12.3. Limitations on Sellers Liability.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the liability of
Seller under this Agreement and any documents delivered in connection
herewith or contemplated hereby shall be limited as follows:   

(a) IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE TO THE BUYER INDEMNITEES FOR ANY
EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE
DAMAGES; _provided, however,_ that if Buyer is held liable to a third party
for any of such damages and Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer for the
matter that gave rise to such damages, then Seller shall be liable for, and
obligated to reimburse Buyer for, such damages.   

(b) Except as provided below, the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary
of the Closing Date; _provided however_ , that (i) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.2 (Authority Relative to this Agreement and
Binding Effect), Section 5.5 (Title to Assets; Encumbrances), and
Section 5.17 (Brokers) shall survive indefinitely, and (ii) representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.9 (Taxes) shall survive for a period
equal to the applicable statute of limitations for the taxable year for each
Tax. The other terms of this Agreement and the agreements delivered
in connection herewith shall survive the Closing. All representations and
warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller under this Agreement and the
indemnities granted by Seller in Section 12.1 shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
East Coast time, on the applicable survival termination date set forth above;
_provided, however,_ that such indemnities shall survive with respect only to
any specific matter that is the subject of a proper Claim Notice delivered in
good faith in compliance with the requirements of this Section 12.3 until the
earlier to occur of (i) the date on which a final nonappealable resolution of
the matter described in such Claim Notice has been reached, including the
determination of all related Losses, if any, regardless of when such Losses
are finally determined or (ii) the date on which the matter described in such
Claim Notice has otherwise reached final resolution, including the
determination of all related Losses, if any, regardless of when such Losses
are finally determined. In no event shall any amounts be recovered from
Seller under Section 12.1 or otherwise for any matter for which a Claim Notice
is not delivered to Seller prior to the close of business on the applicable
expiration date set forth above.   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in any
way whatsoever to the Buyer Indemnitees, for any Losses otherwise subject to
indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (determined after
giving effect to the other provisions of this Section 12.3) until the Buyer
Indemnitees have incurred Losses otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to Section
12.1(a) that in the aggregate exceed Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($8,500,000) (the "Deductible"), after which Seller shall then be
liable for all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees that
are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.1(a) in excess of such amount up to
the maximum amount set forth in Section 12.3(d). Losses subject to
indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a) relating to any single
breach or series of related breaches by Seller shall not constitute
Losses, and therefore shall not be applied toward the Deductible or be
indemnifiable hereunder, unless such Losses relating to any single breach or
series of related breaches exceed $50,000. For the purposes of calculating
the Deductible, none of the dollar limitations or Material Adverse
Effect qualifiers contained in the representations and warranties of Article
V shall be included in calculating Losses that comprise the Deductible.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in any
way whatsoever to the Buyer Indemnitees, for any Losses otherwise subject to
indemnification by Seller (determined after giving effect to the other
provisions of this Section 12.3) that in the aggregate exceed Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000).   

(e) Seller shall have no liability for any claim or Loss (i) that would be
covered by insurance maintained by or for the benefit of Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer (including any such insurance coverage applicable to the
Business the benefit of which Buyer would realize if Buyer were to maintain
insurance coverage as is customary for the industry in which the Business
is conducted consistent with the coverage described in _Schedule 5.19_) or
for which Buyer otherwise recovers payments in respect of such Loss from any
other source(s) (whether in a lump sum or stream of payments) or (ii) that is
the type normally recoverable by the Business through rates and is in fact
substantially recovered by Buyer through rates, provided that Buyer shall have
made a good faith effort to recover any such claim or loss through rates and
that such recovery is not indeterminable due to the terms of any rate
settlement agreed to by Buyer, or is otherwise recovered by Buyer through
rates. No cost or expense relating to any such claim or Loss that is actually
recovered on the basis of the foregoing shall be included in determining the
extent of Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees for purposes of Section
12.3(c) or Section 12.3(d). Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to give timely and effective written notice to the appropriate
insurance carrier(s) of any occurrence or circumstances that, in the judgment
of Buyer consistent with its customary risk management practices, appear
likely to give rise to a claim against Buyer that is likely to involve one or
more insurance policies of Buyer. Any such notice shall be given in good
faith by Buyer without regard to the possibility of indemnification payments
by Seller under Section 12.1, and shall be processed by Buyer in good faith
and in a manner consistent with its risk management practices involving
claims for which no third party contractual indemnification is available.
Buyer agrees that (x) if it is entitled to receive payment from Seller for a
Loss, and (y) if Buyer has obtained insurance that may cover the claim
or matter giving rise to such Loss, then (z) such insurance shall be primary
coverage and Buyer will make a claim under such insurance (if such claim can
be made in good faith) before enforcing its right to receive payment from
Seller. If at any time subsequent to the receipt by a Buyer Indemnitee of an
indemnity payment from Seller hereunder, such Buyer Indemnitee (or any
Affiliate thereof) receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment
with respect to the Loss for which it receives such indemnity payment, such
Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount
of such recovery, less any expense incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee (or its
Affiliates) in connection with such recovery, but in no event shall any such
payment exceed the amount of such indemnity payment.   

(f) Notwithstanding any language contained in any Related Document (including
deeds and other conveyance documents relating to the Real Property), the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement will not
be merged into any such Related Document and the indemnification obligations
of Seller, and the limitations on such obligations, set forth in
this Agreement shall control. No provision set forth in any such Related
Document shall be deemed to enlarge, alter or amend the terms or provisions
of this Agreement.   

       |   |   | Section 12.4. Limitation on Buyers Liability.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER BE LIABLE TO THE SELLER INDEMNITEES FOR ANY EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES;
_provided, however,_ that if Seller is held liable to a third party for any
of such damages and Buyer is obligated to indemnify Seller for the matter
that gave rise to such damages, then Buyer shall be liable for, and obligated
to reimburse Seller for, such damages.   

       |   |   | Section 12.5. Claims Procedure.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

(a) All claims for indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, or any other
provision of this Agreement except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, shall be asserted and resolved pursuant to this Article XII. Any
Person claiming indemnification hereunder is referred to as the "Indemnified
Party" and any Person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is
hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." In the event that any
Losses are asserted against or sought to be collected from or threatened to
be sought from an Indemnified Party by a third party, including a
Governmental Body, said Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness
provide to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any
such Losses if the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnifying Party
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in
reasonably sufficient time so that the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the Losses is not prejudiced. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30
days from the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice
Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not it disputes the
liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party hereunder with
respect to such Losses and/or (ii) whether or not it desires, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Losses; _provided, however,_ that any Indemnified Party is
hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion,
answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party (and of which it
shall have given notice and opportunity to comment to the Indemnifying Party)
and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate
proceedings, and with counsel of its own choosing, which proceedings shall be
promptly settled or prosecuted by them to a final conclusion. If the
Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such
defense or settlement it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If requested
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Losses that the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate and related to the
claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting
the third party Losses, or any cross-complaint against any Person. No claim
may be settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party.   

(b) The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the
Indemnifying Party and provide access to its books, records and personnel as
the Indemnifying Party reasonably requests in connection with the
investigation or defense of the Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall
promptly upon receipt of reasonable supporting documentation reimburse the
Indemnified Party for out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the latter
in providing the requested assistance.   

(c) With regard to third party claims for which Buyer or Seller is entitled to
indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, such indemnification shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party upon (i) the entry of an Order against the
Indemnified Party and the expiration of any applicable appeal period or (ii)
a settlement with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, provided that no
such consent need be obtained if the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to
the Claim Notice as provided in Section 12.5(a). Notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to Section 12.5(a), and provided that there is no
dispute as to the applicability of indemnification, expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the
Indemnifying Party as if such expenses are a liability of the Indemnifying
Party.   

       |   |   | Section 12.6. Exclusive Remedy.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.2(b), 6.4 or 9.2, the rights,
remedies and obligations of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees
set forth in this Article XII will be the exclusive rights, remedies and
obligations of such Persons after the Closing with respect to all post-
Closing claims relating to this Agreement, the events giving rise to this
Agreement and the transactions provided for herein or contemplated hereby or
thereby. No Proceeding for termination or rescission, or claiming
repudiation, of this Agreement may be brought or maintained by either party
against the other following the Closing Date no matter how severe, grave
or fundamental any breach, default or nonperformance may be by one party.
Accordingly, the parties hereby expressly waive and forego any and all rights
they may possess to bring any such Proceeding.   

       |   |   | Section 12.7. Waiver and Release.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Buyer, on behalf of itself and each other Buyer Indemnitee, hereby forever
waives, relieves, releases and discharges the Seller Indemnitees and their
successors and assigns from any and all rights, liabilities, Proceedings
(including future Proceedings) and Losses of any Buyer Indemnitee, whether
known or unknown at the Closing Date, which any Buyer Indemnitee has or
incurs, or may in the future have or incur, arising out of or related to any
Assumed Liability.

Section 13.3.

  |   | Assignment.  
   

   

This Agreement may not be assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however,_ in the
event of any such assignment by a party by operation of law without the
consent of the other party as required above, such other party may consent to
such assignment after it has occurred and, in such event, this Agreement and
all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon the Person receiving such
assignment by operation of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Seller may
assign all or part of its rights or delegate all or part of its duties under
this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Buyer, to a
qualified intermediary chosen by Seller to structure all or part of the
transactions contemplated hereby as a like-kind exchange of property covered
by Section 1031 of the IRC and (b) Buyer may assign all or part of its
rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to a wholly owned
subsidiary.   

       |   |   | Section 13.4. Successor Bound.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Subject to the provisions of Section 13.3, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.   

       |   |   | Section 13.5. Governing Law.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The validity, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement and all Related
Documents, unless expressly provided to the contrary, shall be governed by
the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law of such state.   

       |   |   | Section 13.6. Cooperation.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken all action, and to do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws, regulations or
otherwise, to consummate and to make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the timely performance of all actions and things
contemplated by this Agreement to be taken or done by each of the parties
hereto.   

       |   |   | Section 13.7. Construction of Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The terms and provisions of this Agreement represent the results of
negotiations between Buyer and Seller, each of which has been represented by
counsel of its own choosing, and neither of which has acted under duress or
compulsion, whether legal, economic or otherwise. Accordingly, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance
with their usual and customary meanings, and Buyer and Seller hereby waive
the application in connection with the interpretation and construction of
this Agreement of any rule of law to the effect that ambiguous or conflicting
terms or provisions contained in this Agreement shall be interpreted or
construed against the party whose attorney prepared the executed draft or any
earlier draft of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that neither the
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and none of the parties shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of any inclusion of any such item in the Schedules or
Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes hereof. The
word "including" in this Agreement shall mean including without limitation.
Words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and
words of one gender shall be held to include the other genders as the context
requires. The terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar
import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole (including all of the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article, Section,
paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule references are to the Articles, Sections,
paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified.   

       |   |   | Section 13.8. Publicity.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Neither party hereto shall issue, make or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise make any disclosures relating
thereto, without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however,_ that such consent shall
not be required where such release or announcement is required by applicable
law or the rules or regulations of a securities exchange, in which event the
party so required to issue such release or announcement shall endeavor,
wherever possible, to furnish an advance copy of the proposed release to the
other party.   

       |   |   | Section 13.9. Waiver.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the failure
nor any delay on the part of any party to exercise any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise or waiver of any such right, power or privilege preclude
any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege available to each party at law or in equity.   

       |   |   | Section 13.10. Parties in Interest.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is
not intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto and
their successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder
provided, however, that the indemnification provisions in Article XII shall
inure to the benefit of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees as
provided therein.   

       |   |   | Section 13.11. Section and Paragraph Headings.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.   

       |   |   | Section 13.12. Amendment.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing executed by the
parties hereto.   

       |   |   | Section 13.13. Entire Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the documents
specifically referred to herein and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement, understanding, representations and warranties of the
parties hereto, and supersede all prior agreements, both written and oral,
between Buyer and Seller. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in
any Schedule referenced by a particular paragraph or Section in this
Agreement shall, should the existence of the fact or item or its contents
be relevant to any other paragraph or Section, be deemed to be disclosed with
respect to that other paragraph or Section whether or not any explicit cross-
reference appears therein; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, no disclosures shall be deemed to be disclosed on  _Schedule
5.20_ except for such disclosures explicitly set forth thereon or
explicitly incorporated by reference into _Schedule 5.20_.   

       |   |   | Section 13.14. Counterparts.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.   

       |   |   | Section 13.15. Severability.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.   

       |   |   | Section 13.16. Consent to Jurisdiction.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan and the
federal courts of the United States of America located in the Southern
District of the State of New York over any dispute arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each
party irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each party agrees
that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.
