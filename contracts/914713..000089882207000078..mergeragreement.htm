This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U. S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the last sentence of Section 5.13(a), Parent and the Operating Partnership intend that, for U. S. federal and state income tax purposes, the Partnership Merger shall, in the case of each holder of LP Units that receives consideration other than common units of limited partnership interest in the Surviving Partnership in the Partnership Merger in exchange for such holders LP Units, be treated as a taxable purchase of LP Units directly by Purchaser Sub, and in the case of each such holder, if any, that retains its LP Units in the Partnership Merger (such LP Units to remain out- standing as common units of limited partnership interest in the Surviving Partnership), not be treated as a realization or recognition event to such holder. 

    Section 1.5 _Organization of Holdings, Purchaser Sub and
Purchaser LP; Or_ _ganizational Documents_. 
--- 
  

 

 (a) As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall organize a new corporation ("Holdings" ) under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of effectuating the transactions contemplated hereby. Hold- 

  ings shall be a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdings shall be in such forms as
determined by Parent as soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement.

 

 (b) As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and the organization of Holdings, Parent shall cause Holdings to organize a new limited liability company ("Purchaser Sub") under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of effectuating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser Sub shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. The certificate of formation and the limited liability company agreement of Purchaser Sub shall be in such forms as determined by Parent as soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement. 

 

 (c) As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and the organization of Holdings and Purchaser Sub, Parent shall cause Purchaser Sub to organize a new limited partnership ("Purchaser LP") under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of effectuating the Partnership Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser LP shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser Sub. The limited partnership agreement of Purchaser LP shall be in such form as determined by Parent as soon as practicable following the execution of this Agree- ment. 

 

 (d) Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Company and Parent:

 

 (i) The certificate of formation of Purchaser Sub shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company following the Merger Effective Time until amended in accordance with its terms and the DLLCA. The limited liability company agreement of Purchaser Sub shall be the limited liability com- pany agreement of the Surviving Company following the Merger Effective Time until amended in accordance with its terms and the DLLCA; _provided_ that the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company shall provide for and permit the issuance, as of the Merger Effective Time, of the Mirror Series B Units, Mirror Series C Units, Mirror Series E Units, Mirror Series F Units and Mirror Series G Units (together, the "Mirror Units"), which Mirror Units shall have substantially the same rights, preferences, privileges and voting power as (and in no event shall any differences be materially adverse as compared to) those in the Series B Shares, Series C Shares, Series E Shares, Series F Shares and Se- ries G Shares, respectively, provided for under the applicable certificate of desig- nations immediately prior to the Merger (taking into account any modifications as a result of the Merger) and such other rights, preferences, privileges and voting power as required to be provided to the Mirror Units to comply with the certificate of designations of the applicable Preferred Stock. 

 

 (ii) The limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership shall be the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership following the Partnership Merger Effective Time until amended in accordance 

  with its terms and the DRULPA; _provided_ that (1) in the event of the Public
Hold ing Company Scenario, the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving
Part- nership shall provide that each common unit of limited partnership
interest in the Surviving Partnership shall be convertible into one share of
Holdings Common Stock (instead of one Company Common Share), subject to
customary anti- dilution adjustments, and (2) in the event of the Private
Holding Company Sce- nario, the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving
Partnership shall pro- vide for the preferred units of limited partnership
interest of the Surviving Part- nership with terms as set forth in Section
2.5(a) .

 

 (iii) The certificate of incorporation of Holdings shall be amended and restated immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time so that it has substantially the same terms as (and in no event shall any differences be mate rially adverse as compared to) those terms in the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (taking into account any modifications as a result of the Merger, but without the certificate of designations of the Preferred Shares and subject to Section 1.8(a)), until amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL. 

    Section 1.6 _Managing Member and Officers of the Surviving
Company; Gen_ _eral Partner of the Surviving Partnership_. 
--- 
  

 

 (a) The managing member of the Surviving Company immediately af- ter the Merger Effective Time shall be Holdings, until changed in accordance with the Surviving Companys limited liability company agreement. The officers of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger Effective Time shall consist of the officers of Purchaser Sub as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, until their succes- sors shall have been duly elected or appointed, or until their death, resignation or removal from office in accordance with the Surviving Companys limited liability company agreement. 

 

 (b) The general partner of the Surviving Partnership immediately after the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be the Surviving Company, until a successor shall have been duly elected or appointed, in accordance with the Surviving Partnerships limited partnership agreement. 

    Section 1.7 _Further Assurances_. 
--- 
 

 (a) As promptly as practicable following the formation of Holdings, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP, Parent shall cause and take all such actions as to ensure that (i) the directors of Holdings, the managing member of Purchaser Sub and the general partner of Purchaser LP ratify and approve this Agreement, (ii) the stockholders, limited liability members and limited partners of Holdings, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP, re- spectively, adopt this Agreement and (iii) each of Holdings, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP has authorized sufficient shares of their respective capital stock or equity interests, as appropriate, so as to effect the transactions contemplated by Article V of this Agreement. 

    (b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the parties shall 
 cause this Agreement to be amended to add Holdings, Purchaser Sub and
Purchaser LP as 
 parties hereto, and each such Person shall agree to become a constituent
entity in its re- 
 spective merger under this Agreement. 
  
 (c) If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Company 
 shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances or any 
 other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect
or confirm, of 
 record or otherwise, in the Surviving Company its right, title or interest
in, to or under 
 any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
either Purchaser 
 Sub or the Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the 
 Surviving Company and its proper officers and directors or their designees
shall be au- 
 thorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Purchaser Sub 
 and the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances
and to do, in 
 the name and on behalf of either Purchaser Sub or the Company, all such
other acts and 
 things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm
the Surviving 
 Companys right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, 
 franchises, properties or assets of Purchaser Sub or the Company and
otherwise to carry 
 out the purposes of this Agreement. 
  
 Section 1.8 _Restructuring_. 
  
 (a) If the Company reasonably believes that the issuance of Holdings 
 Common Stock in the Merger may cause the Closing not to occur prior to the
Termina- 
 tion Date, then the Company may alter the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement 
 so that neither the Stock Consideration nor the Stock Election is available
in the Merger, 
 and solely the Per Share Cash Consideration will be issued in the Merger. If
such altera- 
 tion is made, the covenants relating to the Registration Statement, and the
condition set 
 forth in Section 6.1(e), and such other covenants that are necessary solely
for the issuance 
 of the Stock Consideration, shall no longer be applicable. 
  
 (b) In the event that Parent, after consultation with KPMG, reasonably 
 determines in good faith that the Merger, together with the transactions
contemplated by 
 Section 5.13, could reasonably be expected not to result in a step-up in the
basis of the 
 assets of the Company and the Operating Partnership (assuming the Operating
Partner- 
 ship has in effect or makes an election under Section 754 of the Code) for
U.S. federal 
 income tax purposes, then the Parent may require the transaction to be
restructured in a 
 manner that would, in the reasonable, good-faith judgment of Parent, better
assure such 
 tax treatment; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such restructuring shall
(i) not affect the con- 
 sideration contemplated by this Agreement to be received by the holders of
Company 
 Common Shares or the holders of LP Units, (ii) (x) result in the receipt by
the holders of 
 Preferred Stock of securities that have substantially the same rights,
preferences, privi- 
 leges and voting power as (and in no event shall any differences be
materially adverse as 
 compared to) those provided to the Series B Shares, Series C Shares, Series
E Shares, Se- 
 ries F Shares and Series G Shares under the applicable certificate of
designations, includ- 
 ing the same preferential rights to distributions or dividends, and in
liquidation, as the se- 
 curities they are contemplated to receive under the terms hereof, (y) be in
accordance 
--- 
 

    with, and shall not contravene, in any material respect, the terms of the
certificates of des- 
 ignation of the Preferred Shares and (z) not give rise to the requirement
that the holders 
 of any Preferred Shares approve the transaction as so restructured, (iii)
not jeopardize, or 
 delay in any material way, the Closing, and (iv) not require the Company or
the Operat- 
 ing Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries to take any action in
contravention of Law; 
  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company provides Parent with a written
opinion from an in- 
 dependent tax advisor (which advisor is reasonably acceptable to Parent) to
the effect that 
 the Merger, together with the transactions contemplated by Section 5.13,
should result in 
 a step up in the basis of the assets of the Company and the Operating
Partnership (assum- 
 ing the Operating Partnership has in effect or makes an election under
Section 754 of the 
 Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then Parent shall not be
permitted to require 
 that the transaction be so restructured. In the event that the transaction
is restructured, 
 none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company and the
Operating 
 Partnership shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by,
any transac- 
 tion requested by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.8(b) . 
  
 (c) Parent and the Company may mutually agree to restructure the 
 transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that Parent or a wholly owned
Subsidiary 
 conduct a tender offer to acquire all Company Common Shares. Such tender
offer could 
 be an offer to acquire Company Common Shares solely for cash equal to the
Per Share 
 Cash Consideration. 
  
 ARTICLE II 
  
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 
  
 Section 2.1 _Merger Consideration_. 
  
 (a) At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without 
 any further action on the part of any party hereto or any holder of capital
stock of the 
 Company: 
  
 (i) each Company Common Share issued and outstanding im- 
 mediately prior to the Merger Effective Time that is owned by the Company as 
 treasury stock or by Parent or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries (other
than, in 
 each case, shares in trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts
and the 
 like that are beneficially owned by third parties) shall automatically be
cancelled 
 and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with
respect 
 thereto; and 
  
 (ii) each Company Common Share issued and outstanding im- 
 mediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, other than (A) Company Common 
 Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) and (B) shares that are owned
by 
 stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights 
 pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares"), shall
automatically 
 be converted into the right to receive either an amount in cash equal to
$21.00 per 
 share (the "Per Share Cash Consideration") or one (the "Exchange
Ratio") val- 
--- 
 

    idly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 
 per share, of Holdings (each such share being a share of "Holdings Common 
 Stock") (the "Stock Consideration"), in each case as determined pursuant to
and 
 subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4. The Per
Share 
 Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are together referred to
herein as 
 the "Merger Consideration". The shares of the Holdings Common Stock issued 
 in the Merger shall be listed on a U.S. national securities exchange and
shall be 
 registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act (but only so long as any re- 
 quirements of such exchange with respect to number of holders or similar re- 
 quirements have been satisfied). At any time prior to the date of the
Company 
 Stockholder Meeting, Parent may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
increase ei- 
 ther the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Exchange Ratio or both. 
  
 (b) The shares of common stock of Purchaser Sub outstanding imme- 
 diately prior to the Merger Effective Time will, at the Merger Effective
Time, remain 
 outstanding and will constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock 
 of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger Effective Time. 
  
 (c) At the Merger Effective Time, all Company Common Shares 
 (other than Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be 
 canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Common
Share Certifi- 
 cate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the 
 Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such 
 Common Share Certificates in accordance with Section 2.10. 
  
 (d) The capitalization (including number of outstanding shares) of 
 Holdings will be adjusted (through stock split or otherwise) so that, as of
the Merger Ef- 
 fective Time, the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock that shall be
issued and 
 outstanding shall be equal to (i) the sum of the aggregate number of Company
Common 
 Shares and LP Units that will be converted in the Merger and the Partnership
Merger, re- 
 spectively, into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration
pursuant to Section 
 2.1(a)(ii) or Section 2.2(a)(i), _plus_ the aggregate number of Dissenting
Shares, _plus_ the 
 aggregate number of Company Common Shares held by Parent or any of its
wholly 
 owned Subsidiaries that were cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) (such
sum, the 
 "Parent Interest"), _plus_ (ii) the aggregate number of Company Common
Shares and LP 
 Units that will be converted in the Merger and the Partnership Merger,
respectively, into 
 the right to receive the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)
and Section 
 2.2(a)(i), respectively. As of the Merger Effective Time, Parent or a wholly
owned or 
 majority owned Subsidiary of Parent shall hold a number of shares of
Holdings Common 
 Stock equal to the Parent Interest. 
  
 Section 2.2 _Partnership Merger Consideration_. 
  
 (a) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partner- 
 ship Merger and without any further action on the part of any party hereto
or the holders 
 of any Partnership Units: 
--- 
 

    (i) each LP Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to 
 the Partnership Merger Effective Time, other than (A) any LP Unit that is
owned 
 by Parent, the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect
Subsidiaries 
 (unless such LP Unit is in a trust account, managed account, custodial
account or 
 similar account and is beneficially owned by a third party) and (B) any LP
Unit 
 owned of record by an Electing Holder and with respect to which a Roll-Over 
 Election has been made, shall, subject to Section 2.3 and Section 2.4,
automati- 
 cally be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; 
  
 (ii) each LP Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to 
 the Partnership Merger Effective Time that is (A) owned by Parent, the
Company 
 or any of their respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries (other than, in
each case, 
 such LP Units in trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and
the 
 like that are beneficially owned by third parties) or (B) owned of record by
an 
 Electing Holder and with respect to which a Roll-Over Election has been made 
 shall remain outstanding as a common unit of limited partnership interest in
the 
 Surviving Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the Private Holding
Company 
 Scenario such LP Units owned of record by an Electing Holder shall be
converted 
 into preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Surviving
Partnership as 
 contemplated by Section 2.5(a) (the Merger Consideration and the common unit 
 (or preferred unit, if applicable) of limited partnership interest in the
Surviving 
 Partnership are together referred to herein as the "Partnership Merger
Consid- 
 eration"); and 
  
 (iii) all of the common units of limited partnership interest of 
 Purchaser LP outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective 
 Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive a number of
com- 
 mon units of limited partnership interest in the Surviving Partnership equal
to the 
 number of LP Units that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Con- 
 sideration pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) . 
  
 (b) The general partnership interest of the Operating Partnership held 
 by the Company shall remain outstanding and constitute the only outstanding
general 
 partnership interest in the Surviving Partnership immediately following the
Partnership 
 Merger. 
  
 Section 2.3 _Stock Election_. 
  
 (a) Subject to Section 2.4, each holder of Company Common Shares 
 (other than holders of such shares that are to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(i) and 
 other than the holders of Dissenting Shares) and each holder of LP Units
(other than 
 holders of such units that are to remain outstanding or be converted into
preferred units 
 pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(ii)) shall be entitled to submit a request
specifying (i) the num- 
 ber of Company Common Shares or LP Units, as the case may be, which such
holder de- 
 sires to have converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration in the 
 Merger or the Partnership Merger (such request with respect to Company
Common 
 Shares or LP Units, a "Cash Election") and (ii) the number of Company Common
Shares 
--- 
 

    or LP Units which such holder desires to have converted into the right to
receive the 
 Stock Consideration in the Merger or the Partnership Merger (such request
with respect 
 to Company Common Shares or LP Units, a "Stock Election"). Any Cash Election
or 
 Stock Election is referred to herein as a "Cash/Stock Election". All such
Cash/Stock 
 Elections shall be made on a form specified by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the 
 Company for that purpose (a "Cash/Stock Election Form"). Holders of record
of Com- 
 pany Common Shares who hold such Company Common Shares as nominees, trustees
or 
 in other representative capacities may submit multiple Cash/Stock Election
Forms, pro- 
 vided that such nominee, trustee or representative certifies that each such
Cash/Stock 
 Election Form covers all Company Common Shares held for a particular
beneficial 
 owner. 
  
 (b) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of 
 record of Company Common Shares as of the record date for the Company
Stockholder 
 Meeting, together with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant to Section
5.2(c), (i) a 
 Cash/Stock Election Form, (ii) a letter of transmittal in customary form (a
"Letter of 
 Transmittal") that shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of
loss and title to 
 the certificates representing Company Common Shares (each, a "Common Share
Cer- 
 tificate") shall pass only upon delivery of the Common Share Certificates
(or affidavits 
 of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.10(g)) to the Exchange
Agent and (iii) 
 instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Common Share
Certificates (or affi- 
 davits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.10(g)) in
exchange for the 
 Merger Consideration. Parent shall also cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder 
 of LP Units, at the same time that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed
to the holders 
 of Company Common Shares, (A) a Cash/Stock Election Form, (B) a letter of
transmittal 
 or certificate (a "Unitholder Letter of Transmittal") that shall certify to
Parent and to 
 the Exchange Agent the number of LP Units held by such holder and (C)
instructions for 
 use in effecting the delivery of the Unitholder Letter of Transmittal to
receive the Merger 
 Consideration. The forms of the Letter of Transmittal, Unitholder Letter of
Transmittal 
 and instructions shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company.
The Com- 
 pany shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mail or otherwise make
available the 
 Cash/Stock Election Form and a Letter of Transmittal to all persons who
become record 
 holders of Company Common Shares during the period between the record date
for the 
 Company Stockholders Meeting and the Cash/Stock Election Deadline. 
  
 (c) Cash/Stock Elections shall be made by holders of Company Com- 
 mon Shares or LP Units by delivering the Cash/Stock Election Form to the
Exchange 
 Agent (it being understood that the Cash/Stock Election Form may be combined
with the 
 Letter of Transmittal and/or the Unitholder Letter of Transmittal in one
document). To be 
 effective, a Cash/Stock Election Form must be properly completed, signed and
submitted 
 to the Exchange Agent by no later than the date and time set forth in the
Cash/Stock Elec- 
 tion Form (the "Cash/Stock Election Deadline"), which Cash/Stock Election
Deadline 
 shall be no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day
preceding the 
 date of the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Cash/Stock Election Form shall
be ac- 
 companied by (i) a properly completed and signed Letter of Transmittal or
Unitholder 
 Letter of Transmittal, as applicable, and (ii) only in the case of holders
of Company 
 Common Shares, (A) the Common Share Certificates representing the Company
Com- 
--- 
 

    mon Shares as to which the Cash/Stock Election is being made or (B) an
appropriate 
 guarantee of delivery of such Common Share Certificates as set forth in such
Cash/Stock 
 Election Form from a firm that is a member of a registered national
securities exchange 
 or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial
bank or trust 
 company having an office or correspondent in the United States; _provided_
that such 
 Common Share Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within
three New 
 York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") trading days after the date of execution of
such guaran- 
 tee of delivery (a "Guarantee of Delivery"). Failure to deliver Common Share
Certifi- 
 cates covered by any Guarantee of Delivery within three (3) NYSE trading
days after the 
 date of execution of such Guarantee of Delivery shall be deemed to
invalidate any other- 
 wise properly made Cash Election or Stock Election. 
  
 (d) The Exchange Agent will have the discretion to determine whether 
 Cash/Stock Election Forms have been properly and timely completed, signed
and submit- 
 ted or revoked and to disregard immaterial defects in Cash/Stock Election
Forms. The 
 good-faith decision of the Exchange Agent in such matters shall be
conclusive and bind- 
 ing; _provided_ that the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion, seek
guidance from both 
 Parent and the Company in connection therewith. Neither Parent nor the
Company nor 
 the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in a 
 Cash/Stock Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent
shall 
 also make all computations contemplated by Section 2.4 and all such
computations shall 
 be conclusive and binding on the holders of Company Common Shares in the
absence of 
 manifest error. Any Cash/Stock Election Form may be changed or revoked prior
to the 
 Cash/Stock Election Deadline. In the event a Cash/Stock Election Form is
revoked prior 
 to the Cash/Stock Election Deadline, the Company shall, or shall cause the
Exchange 
 Agent to, cause the Certificates representing the Company Common Shares
covered by 
 such Cash/Stock Election Form to be promptly returned without charge to the
Person 
 submitting the Cash/Stock Election Form upon written request to that effect
from such 
 Person. 
  
 (e) For the purpose hereof, unless waived by Parent in its sole and ab- 
 solute discretion, a holder of Company Common Shares or LP Units that (A)
does not 
 submit a properly completed and signed Cash/Stock Election Form that is
received by the 
 Exchange Agent prior to the Cash/Stock Election Deadline (including a holder
who sub- 
 mits and then revokes such holders Cash/Stock Election Form and does not
resubmit a 
 Cash/Stock Election Form which is timely received by the Exchange Agent), or
(B) sub- 
 mits a Cash/Stock Election Form without the corresponding Common Shares
Certificates 
 or a Guarantee of Delivery, or (C) submits a Cash/Stock Election Form that
is defective 
 in any manner such that the Exchange Agent cannot reasonably determine the
election 
 preference of the holder submitting such Cash/Stock Election Form, shall be
deemed to 
 have made a "Non-Election". 
  
 (f) Each Company Common Share or LP Unit that is subject to a Non- 
 Election shall be deemed for all purposes of this Article II to be subject
to a Cash Elec- 
 tion; accordingly, each Company Common Share or LP Unit subject to a Non-
Election or 
 to a valid Cash Election shall be converted in the Merger or the Partnership
Merger, as 
 the case may be, into the Per Share Cash Consideration. 
--- 
 

    (g) The rights of holders of Dissenting Shares shall be determined in 
 accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law and as provided in Section 2.8. 
  
 Section 2.4 _Proration_. 
  
 (a) The determination of whether Company Common Shares (other 
 than Company Common Shares that are to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i)) or 
 the LP Units shall be converted in the Merger or the Partnership Merger, as
the case may 
 be, into the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration shall
be made as set 
 forth in this Section 2.4. 
  
 (b) Each Company Common Share or LP Unit that is subject to a Cash 
 Election (or, pursuant to Section 2.3(f), deemed subject to a Cash Election)
shall be con- 
 verted in the Merger or the Partnership Merger, as the case may be, into the
Per Share 
 Cash Consideration. As is more fully set forth below, the aggregate number
of Company 
 Common Shares and LP Units to be converted in the Merger into the right to
receive the 
 Stock Consideration shall in no event result in the issuance to holders of
Company Com- 
 mon Shares or LP Units of an aggregate number of shares of Holdings Common
Stock in 
 excess of the Maximum Holdings Common Share Amount. 
  
 (c) If Stock Elections are received for a number of Company Common 
 Shares and LP Units which, after giving effect to the Merger or the
Partnership Merger, 
 as the case may be, would result in the issuance of more than the Maximum
Holdings 
 Common Share Amount, then each Company Common Share and LP Unit for which a 
 valid Stock Election has been received shall be converted in the Merger or
the Partner- 
 ship Merger, as the case may be, into the Stock Consideration in the
following manner: 
 for each valid Stock Election, the number of Company Common Shares or LP
Units cov- 
 ered by such Stock Election that shall receive the Stock Consideration shall
be the total 
 number of Company Common Shares and LP Units covered by such Stock Election
mul- 
 tiplied by the Stock Election Proration Factor. Each Company Common Share or
LP 
 Unit covered by a Stock Election, if not converted into the right to receive
the Stock Con- 
 sideration in accordance with this Section 2.4(c), shall be converted into
the right to re- 
 ceive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 
  
 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if 
 Stock Elections are received for a number of Company Common Shares or LP
Units that, 
 after giving effect to the Merger and the Partnership Merger, would result
in the issuance 
 of less than the Minimum Holdings Common Share Amount, each Company Common 
 Share or LP Unit (other than LP Units with respect to which a valid and
timely Roll-Over 
 Election has been made) shall be converted in the Merger or the Partnership
Merger, as 
 the case may be, into the Per Share Cash Consideration. 
  
 Section 2.5 _Roll-Over Election_. 
  
 (a) Each Eligible Holder may, at such holders sole discretion, elect 
 (each a "Roll-Over Election") to continue as a limited partner of the
Surviving Partner- 
 ship, in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement of the
Surviving Partner- 
--- 
 

    13 
--- 
 

 

  ship, as follows: (i) if any Company Common Shares are converted into
Stock Considera 
 tion in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 (the "Public
Holding Com- 
 pany Scenario"), Eligible Holders may make a Roll-Over Election to receive
common 
 units of limited partnership interest, with substantially the same rights,
preferences, privi- 
 leges and voting power as those of the LP Units (it being understood that
such common 
 units of limited partnership interest shall be convertible into Holding
Common Stock in- 
 stead of Company Common Shares); (ii) if no Company Common Shares are
converted 
 into Stock Consideration in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section
2.4 (the "Pri- 
 vate Holding Company Scenario"), Eligible Holders may make a Roll-Over
Election to 
 receive preferred units of limited partnership interest in customary form
with a liquida- 
 tion preference per unit equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration entitling
the holder to 
 preferential distributions at 6.00% per annum of such liquidation preference
(the "Cou- 
 pon Amount"), carrying a right to be redeemed at the election of the holder
of the pre- 
 ferred unit for cash at its liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid
Coupon 
 Amounts at any time upon reasonable notice after the earlier of (1) the
three-year anni- 
 versary of the Partnership Merger Effective Time and (2) the occurrence of
any event that 
 would result in an allocation of income or gain in excess of the Coupon
Amount to such 
 holder for tax purposes with respect to such preferred units, and providing
the Surviving 
 Company with a right to redeem such preferred unit for cash at its
liquidation preference 
 plus accrued and unpaid Coupon Amounts at any time after the tenth
anniversary of the 
 Partnership Merger Effective Time; or (iii) in either the Public Holding
Company Sce- 
 nario or the Private Holding Company Scenario, as may be contemplated by
Section 5.13, 
 to become limited partners of a newly formed Subsidiary of the Surviving
Partnership 
 that (A) succeeds to substantially all of the business and assets of the
Surviving Partner- 
 ship and (B) has a limited partnership agreement in a form reasonably agreed
upon by 
 Parent and the Company (the "New Partnership") (it being understood that the
terms of 
 the partnership interests in the New Partnership will be consistent with
terms set forth in 
 clauses (i) and (ii) above, as applicable). An Eligible Holder making a
Roll-Over Elec- 
 tion shall not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and Section
2.2(a)(ii) shall 
 apply. 
  
 (b) Roll-Over Elections shall be made in a form agreed by Parent and 
 the Company for that purpose (a "Roll-Over Election Form"). Concurrently
with the 
 mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant to Section 5.2(c), the
Operating 
 Partnership shall mail the Roll-Over Election Form and Unitholder Letter of
Transmittal 
 to each Eligible Holder of LP Units registered on the transfer books of the
Operating 
 Partnership. The Roll-Over Election Form shall (i) specify the number of LP
Units with 
 respect to which the Electing Holder is making a Roll-Over Election, (ii)
state that, by 
 making a Roll-Over Election, a holder of LP Units shall be deemed to have
uncondition- 
 ally and irrevocably waived any and all rights such holder may have against
the Company 
 or the Operating Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or repre- 
 sentatives under the Partnership Agreement, (iii) provide any information or
certification 
 relating to Taxes that is reasonably required in connection with the
transactions contem- 
 plated hereby and (iv) if applicable, provide for the Electing Holder to
become a limited 
 partner in the New Partnership. To be effective, a Roll-Over Election Form
must be duly 
 completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent, and must be received
by the 
 Exchange Agent by the date (the "Roll-Over Election Deadline") specified in
the Roll-   Over Election Form, which Roll-Over Election Deadline shall be no later
than 5:00 p.m. 
 (New York City time) on the Business Day preceding the date of the Company
Stock- 
 holders Meeting. Any Eligible Holder that has the right to make, and has
made, a Roll- 
 Over Election pursuant to this Section 2.5 (each an "Electing Holder") may
at any time 
 prior to the Roll-Over Election Deadline revoke such Roll-Over Election by
written no- 
 tice to the Exchange Agent received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Roll-
Over Elec- 
 tion Deadline. Any Electing Holder that does not submit a properly completed
Roll-Over 
 Election Form which is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Roll-Over
Election 
 Deadline, or that has duly revoked such Roll-Over Election, shall be deemed
not to have 
 made a Roll-Over Election and shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pur- 
 suant to Section 2.2(a)(i) . The Exchange Agent shall, in its reasonable
discretion, deter- 
 mine whether a Roll-Over Election Form has been properly completed, signed
and sub- 
 mitted or revoked and whether to disregard immaterial defects in such form
and such de- 
 cision shall be conclusive and binding; _provided_ that the Exchange Agent
may, in its dis- 
 cretion, seek guidance from both Parent and the Company in connection
therewith. Nei- 
 ther Parent nor the Company nor the Exchange Agent will be under any
obligation to no- 
 tify any person of any defect in a Roll-Over Election Form submitted to the
Exchange 
 Agent. Any materially defective Roll-Over Election not cured prior to the
Roll-Over 
 Election Deadline shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the
holder making 
 such purported Roll-Over Election shall be deemed not to have made a Roll-
Over Elec- 
 tion and shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 
 2.2(a)(i) and Section 2.4. 
  
 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, an "Eligible Holder" means (i) in 
 the Public Holding Company Scenario, any holder of LP Units and (ii) in the
Private 
 Holding Company Scenario, any holder of LP Units who is an Accredited
Investor and 
 holds at least 5,000 Units. 
  
 Section 2.6 _Preferred Stock and Preferred Units_. 
  
 (a) Each (i) Series B Share issued and outstanding immediately prior 
 to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically be converted into one
Series B cumula- 
 tive redeemable preferred unit of limited liability company interest in the
Surviving 
 Company ("Mirror Series B Units"), (ii) Series C Share issued and
outstanding immedi- 
 ately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically be converted
into one Series 
 C cumulative redeemable preferred unit of limited liability company interest

 viving Company ("Mirror Series C Units"), (iii) Series E Share issued and
outstanding 
 immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into one 
 Series E cumulative redeemable preferred unit of limited liability company
interest in the 
 Surviving Company ("Mirror Series E Units"), (iv) Series F Share issued and
out- 
 standing immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically
be con- 
 verted into one Series F cumulative redeemable preferred unit of limited
liability com- 
 pany interest in the Surviving Company ("Mirror Series F Units") and (v)
Series G 
 Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
shall auto- 
 matically be converted into one Series G cumulative redeemable preferred
unit of limited 
 liability company interest in the Surviving Company ("Mirror Series G
Units").

    (b) Each Preferred Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to 
 the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
immediately 
 after the Partnership Merger Effective Time in accordance with its terms. 
  
 Section 2.7 _Company Options; Company SARs; Restricted Shares_. 
  
 (a) At the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase 
 Company Common Shares (collectively, the "Company Options") granted under
the 
 Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan, 1994 Amended and Restated Executive Equity
In- 
 centive Plan and 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Company
Equity Plans 
 and each outstanding stock appreciation right and cash-settled restricted
stock unit (col- 
 lectively, the "Company SARs"), other than Out-of-the-Money Options, whether
or not 
 then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and of no further force and
effect and the 
 holder of each such Company Option or Company SAR shall be entitled to
receive from 
 Parent, as soon as practicable after, but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days af 
 ter, the Merger Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the number 
 of Company Common Shares subject to each such Company Option or Company SAR, 
 as applicable and (ii) the excess of the Per Share Cash Consideration over
the exercise 
 price per share of such Company Option or Company SAR, as applicable, which
cash 
 payment shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any applicable
statutory 
 minimum withholding Tax. In connection with the Merger, as of immediately
prior to 
 the Merger Effective Time, any restrictions with respect to outstanding
restricted shares 
 shall terminate or lapse. Upon the termination or lapse of such
restrictions, such shares 
 shall be outstanding Company Common Shares and shall be converted into the
right to 
 receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) and
Section 2.3 
 this Agreement. 
  
 (b) In the event that the exercise price per share of any Company Op 
 tion equals or exceeds the Per Share Cash Consideration (any such Company
Option, an 
 "Out-of-the-Money Option"), then such Out-of-the-Money Option shall be
cancelled 
 and of no further force and effect. 
  
 Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. No holder of Company Common Shares that 
 has perfected a demand for appraisal rights with respect to its Company
Common Shares pursu 
 ant to Section 262 of the DGCL (a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall be
entitled to receive the 
 Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Common Shares owned by such
Dissenting 
 Stockholder unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have
effectively withdrawn or 
 lost such Dissenting Stockholders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each
Dissenting Stock- 
 holder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262
of the DGCL with 
 respect to Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice upon receipt by 
 the Company of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, 
 any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
the Company relat 
 ing to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and pro 
 ceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, 
 except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to 
 any demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or ap 
 prove any withdrawal of any such demands.

 change Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.9, a cash
payment in lieu of 
 such fractional share of Holdings Common Stock equal to the product of such
fractional share 
 interest to which such holder of Company Common Shares or LP Units would
otherwise be enti- 
 tled multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration. 
  
 Section 2.10 _Exchange of and Payment for Securities_.

 holders Meeting, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
agreeable to 
 the Company to act as exchange and paying agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
the 
 Merger Consideration and for purposes of receiving Cash/Stock Election Forms
and Roll- 
 Over Election Forms and determining, in accordance with this Article II, the
form of

 ment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Cash Consideration or
other amounts 
 payable pursuant to this Article II, and that Parent shall promptly provide,
or shall cause 
 the Surviving Company to provide, additional funds to the Exchange Agent in

 Company. The Exchange Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration out of the

 as soon as practicable after the Merger Effective Time the Exchange Agent
shall 
 distribute to each such holder a certificate representing the shares of
Holdings 
 Common Stock to which each such holder is entitled and the Common Share Cer- 
 tificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contem- 
 plated by this Section 2.10, each such Common Share Certificate shall be

 required by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Partnership, the holder of
the LP 
 Units identified in such Cash/Stock Election Form and Unitholder Letter of 
 Transmittal that have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash

 nership, the Merger Consideration shall be paid to a transferee if (A) such
trans- 
 feree delivers a Cash/Stock Election Form and/or Unitholder Letter of

trans- 
 fer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than

    Section 3.9   |   | _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. 
---|---|--- 

 

 (a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries hold all permits, li- censes, certificates, registrations, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary or required by any applicable Law or Order for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to so hold, individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute and would not reasonably be expected to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Com- pany Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, is not material. 

 

 (b) Other than the Restatement and Related Matters, since January 1, 2004, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their respective busi- 

  nesses in compliance with applicable Law, except for any violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not material.

 

 (c) Other than the Restatement and Related Matters, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened, other than those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material.

Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets which in
any manner challenges or seeks to prevent or enjoin, alter or materially delay
the Merger, the Partnership Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

    Section 3.11 _Taxes_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be material: 
--- 
  

 

 (a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed (or had filed on its behalf) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them (after giving effect to any filing extension granted by a Governmental Entity) and (ii) has paid (or had paid on its behalf) or will timely pay all material Taxes (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns) that are required to be paid by it (other than those that are being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings or for which appropriate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP). To the Knowledge of the Company, such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Company Balance Sheet reflects an adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) for all Taxes payable by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements and Taxes payable by the Company and Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date will not exceed such reserve as adjusted through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. True and materially complete copies of all federal Tax Returns that have been filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") by each of the Company and the Operating Partnership with respect to the taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2003 have been provided or made available to representatives of Parent. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has executed or filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority any agreement, waiver or other document or arrangement extending the period for assessment or collection of material Taxes (including any applicable statute of limitation), which waiver or extension is currently in effect, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no power of attorney with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

    (b) The Company, (i) for all taxable years commencing with the Com-
panys taxable year ending December 31, 1997 through December 31, 2006, has
been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning
of Section 856 of the Code (a "REIT ") and has been organized and operated in
conformity with the re- quirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
for such years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2006 to the date hereof
in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year that
includes the date hereof, and (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a
manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year
of the Company that will end with the Merger. To the knowledge of the Company,
no chal- lenge to the Companys status as a REIT is pending or has been
threatened in writing.  No Company Subsidiary, excluding any Company
Subsidiary in which the Company holds 10% or less by both vote and value,
within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(4)(B)(iii), is a corporation for U.
S. federal income tax purposes, other than a cor- poration that qualifies as
a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the
Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section 856(1)
of the Code.

 

  (c) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, or
limited liability company and which has not elected to be a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Code Section 856(1)(i) has been since its
formation treated for U. S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or
disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an
association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of its
formation or the acquisition by the Company of a direct or indirect interest
therein owned any assets (including securities) that have caused the Company
to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or would cause the Company to violate
Section 856(c)(4) of the Code on the last day of any calendar quarter after
the date hereof.

 

  (d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the
Code.

 

  (e) Since January 1, 2003, (i) the Company and the Company Subsidi-
aries have not incurred any liability for material Taxes under Sections
857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously paid and
(ii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material
liability for Taxes that have become due and that have not been previously
paid other than in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (other than a
"taxable REIT subsidiary" or any subsidiary of a "taxable REIT subsidi- ary")
has engaged at any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning
of Sec- tion 857(b)(6) of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that
would give rise to "rede- termined rents, redetermined deductions and
excess interest" described in section 857(b)(7) of the Code. To the knowledge
of the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax de- scribed in
the preceding sentences will be imposed on the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

    (f) All material deficiencies asserted or material assessments made
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and that have been set
forth in writing to the Company or any such Company Subsidiary as a result of
any examinations by the IRS or any other taxing authority of the Tax Returns
of or covering or including the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been
fully paid, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no other material
audits, examinations or other proceedings relat- ing to any material Taxes of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any taxing au- thority in progress.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice
from any taxing authority that it intends to conduct such an audit, examina-
tion or other proceeding in respect of a material amount of Taxes or make any
material assessment for Taxes. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is a party to any litigation or pending litigation or administrative
proceeding relating to a material amount of Taxes (other than litigation
dealing with appeals of property tax valuations).

 

  (g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, in all
material respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to
the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant
to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions
under any foreign laws) and have duly and timely withheld and have paid over
to the appropriate taxing authori- ties all material amounts required to be
so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

 

  (h) To the Knowledge of the Company no material claim has been made in
writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Com-
pany Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any such
Company Sub- sidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

  (i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has requested any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return, which material
Tax Return has not yet been filed.

 

  (j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
Tax sharing or similar agreement or arrangement other than any agreement or
ar- rangement solely between the Company and any Company Subsidiary, pursuant
to which it will have any obligation to make any payments after the Closing.

 

  (k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has requested a
private letter ruling from the IRS or comparable rulings from other taxing
authorities.

 

  (l) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (A) is or has ever
been a member of an affiliated group (other than a group the common parent of
which is the Company or a directly or indirectly wholly-owned Company
Subsidiary) fil- ing a consolidated federal income tax return and (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of an- other person other than the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries under Treasury regu- lation 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor or by
contract.

  (m) Other than Liens for Taxes not yet delinquent and Liens for Taxes being contested in good faith and for which there are adequate reserves on the financial statements of the Company (if such reserves are required pursuant to GAAP), there are no Liens for a material amount of Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable for which adequate reserves have been made in accordance with GAAP) upon any of the as- sets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

 

 (n) There are no Tax Protection Agreements currently in force and, as of the date of this Agreement, no person has raised in writing, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened to raise, a material claim against the Company, the Operating Part- nership or any Company Subsidiary for any breach of any Tax Protection Agreement. 

 

 (o) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any understanding or arrangement described in Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) or is a material advisor as defined in Section 6111(b) of the Code. 

 

 (p) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has en- tered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any cor- responding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law).

   pany Property (each, an "REA") . Each such ground lease and REA is in full
force and effect and is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its
terms against the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and, to the
Knowledge of the Com- pany, against the other parties thereto. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidi- ary, on the one hand, nor, to the Knowledge
of Company, any other party, on the other hand, is in material default under

Purchaser Parties a correct and complete copy of each such ground lease and
REA and all amendments, modifica- tions, supplements, renewals, extensions and
guarantees related thereto as of the date hereof. Each such ground lease and

Parties) constitutes the entire agreement with the other parties thereto such
that there are no understandings, representations, warranties or promises not
set forth in full therein.

Purchaser Parties a correct and complete copy of each Material Lease and all
amend- ments thereto. Each Material Lease is in full force and effect and is
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as would
not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except only as set forth in Section 3.16(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (i) no tenant is in arrears in the payment of rent, additional rent or
any other material charges due under any Material Lease, or, to the knowledge
of Company or any Company Subsidiary, is materially in default in the
per- formance of any other obligations under the applicable Material Lease;
(ii) there are no rent concessions (whether in form of cash contributions,

Leases; (iii) no tenant has an option to terminate its respective Material
Lease except as provided in the Material Leases; (iv) to the knowledge of Com-

such tenant at the related leased premises failing to exceed specified
threshold amounts specified in such Material Lease or any other agreement or
document. "Material Lease" means for any Company Property any lease, and all
amendments thereto, (A) to an "anchor tenant" occupying at least 200,000
square feet with respect to such Company Property or (B) that is one of the
five largest leases with respect to such Company Property in terms of gross

    Section 3.17 _Insurance_. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a list that is correct and complete in all material respects of
the insurance policies held by or for the benefit of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. The Company and all Company Subsidiaries maintain
insurance coverage with insurers, or maintain self-insurance practices, in
such amounts and covering such risks which in its good-faith judgment are
reasonable for the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(taking into account the cost and avail- ability of such insurance). There is
no claim by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pend- ing under any such
policies which (i) has been denied or disputed by the insurer and (ii) would
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All such insur- ance policies are in full force and effect, all
premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, and no written notice of
cancellation or termination has been received by the Company or the Operating
Partnership with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on
substan- tially similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation.

 

  Section 3.18 _Material Contracts_. Section 3.18 of the Company
Disclosure Let- ter sets forth a list that is correct and complete in
all material respects of each contract, arrange- ment, commitment or

Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound and (a) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S- K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of
this Agreement that has not been filed or incor- porated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents, (b) that materially restricts or purports to
materially restrict the conduct of any material line of business by the
Company or any of its Sub- sidiaries or, upon consummation of the transactions

material line of business by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiar- ies to engage in any line of business or (c) that, upon
consummation of the transactions contem- plated by this Agreement, will
subject any of the Company or any of its affiliates to any material
exclusivity arrangements with or to a labor union or guild (including any
collective bargaining agreement). Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 3.18, together with any
TIF-related agreements and material license or contract relat- ing to the
Company Intellectual Property, whether or not set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter and including all contracts, arrangements,
commitments or understandings filed or incor- porated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents, is referred to in this Agreement as a
"Material Contract". Each Material Contract is valid, binding and enforceable
in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiar- ies, as applicable, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to the other parties thereto.

 (a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, (i) the Company and Parent shall prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, a proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") in preliminary form or such other form, statement or report as may be required under the federal securities laws relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval (which Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be included as a prospectus in the Registration Statement described in clause (ii) below) and (ii) Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other appropriate form) (the "Registration Statement"), in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus relating to the shares of Holdings Common Stock to be issued to holders of Company Common Shares or LP Units in the Merger or the Partnership Merger, and relating to the LP Units of the Surviving Partner- ship to be issued to holders of LP Units in the Partnership Merger, and, if required by the Securities Act, relating to the preferred units of limited liability company interests of the Surviving Company to be issued in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.6. Each of Parent, Purchaser Sub, Purchaser LP and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP shall notify the other parties promptly following the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or for additional infor- mation and will supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, and will consult with the other parties and their counsel prior to making any response to the SEC with respect thereto. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, and any supplement or amendment thereto, shall comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of Law. If an event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration State- ment, (A) Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such event, (B) the Company, Purchaser Sub or Purchaser LP, as the case may be, shall prepare and file with the SEC any such amendment or supplement to the Proxy State- 

  ment/Prospectus or the Registration Statement and (C) each of the Company,
Parent, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such amendment or supplement cleared or declared
effective, as the case may be, as promptly as practicable after such filing.
The Company agrees, as to itself, the Operating Partnership and the other
Company Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied by it, the
Operating Partnership or any of the other Company Subsidiaries for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective, at the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
stockholders of the Company and to holders of LP Units, at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting and at the Merger Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the agreement contained in this sentence shall
not be applicable to any statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement based on information
supplied by or on behalf of any Purchaser Party or any of its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. Each Purchaser Party agrees,
as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied by it
or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective, at the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
stockholders of the Company and to holders of LP Units, at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting and at the Merger Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the agreement contained in this sentence shall
not be applicable to any statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement based on information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any
other Company Subsidiary for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 

 (b) The Company will, as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective, mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders and to the holders of LP Units and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company Board of Directors shall recommend to its stockholders that they approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (the "Company Recom- mendation"), and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall be permitted to (i) not recommend to the Company stockholders that they provide the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or the other Purchaser Parties its recommendation to the Company stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval or (iii) recommend any Superior Competing Transaction (each, a "Change in Recommendation") if, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii), a majority of the disinterested members of the Company Board of Directors determines, in their good faith judgment and after consultation with outside legal 

  counsel and independent financial advisors, that the failure of the Company
Board of Directors to effect such Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Purchaser Parties agree and acknowledge that the Company Board of Directors
may (A) base the Company Recommendation on solely the Per Share Cash
Consideration and not on the Stock Consideration, (B) may recommend that the
Company stockholders make the Cash Election and not the Stock Election, or
make no recommendation regarding the Stock Election, and (C) may recommend
that the holders of LP Units make the Cash Election and not the Stock Election
or the Roll-Over Election, or make no recommendation to the holders of LP
Units, and that none of the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) shall be a
"Change in Recommendation" for purposes of this Agreement.

 

 (c) If on the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting or any subsequent adjournment thereof, the Company has not received proxies representing a suffi- cient number of Company Common Shares to approve the Merger, the Company may adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 (c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall notify Parent, orally and in writing, immediately following receipt, of material terms and conditions of any written or oral proposal (including the identity of the parties) which any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of their respective Representatives may receive after the date hereof relating to a Competing Transaction and shall keep Par- 

  ent informed in all material respects and on a timely basis as to the status
of and any material developments regarding any such proposal.

 

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Competing Transaction" means any of the following (other than the transactions expressly provided for in and to be effected pursuant to this Agreement): (i) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or the Operating Partnership or any other Significant Subsidiary of the Company; (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (x) 25% or more of the consolidated gross assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Operating Partnership or any other Significant Subsidiary of the Company (or any debt or equity securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such amount of voting securities) or (z) 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Operating Partnership or any other Significant Subsidiary of the Company (or any debt or equity securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such amount of voting securities) if such securities carry the right, contractually or otherwise, to appoint or designate any member or members of the Company Board of Directors; or (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Operating Partnership. 

 

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Competing Trans- action" means a _bona fide_ written proposal for a Competing Transaction, which proposal was not, directly or indirectly, the result of a breach of this Section 5.3, made by a third party (x) on terms that a majority of the disinterested members of the Company Board of Directors determines in their good faith judgment (based on the financial analysis and other advice of independent financial advisors and on the advice of independent legal advisors, and after giving effect to the payment of the Break-Up Fee and the Expenses pursuant to Section 7.2 and to the expected timing of the closing of the proposed Competing Transaction) to be more favorable to the Company Common Stockholders than the Merger Consideration (taking into account any changes to the Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 5.4(b)), (y) which is reasonably likely to be consummated (taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including any conditions, and the identity of the offeror) and (z) for which fi- nancing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or which, in the good faith judgment of a majority of such disinterested members (based on the advice of independent financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being timely financed by such third party. 

 

 (f) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 by any Representative, acting on behalf of the Company or any of its officers, trustees, directors or employees, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 

  ---|---|--- 

 

 (a) Notwithstanding Section 5.3 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, following the receipt after the date hereof by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of a _bona fide_ written proposal from a Person for a Competing Transaction that a majority of the disinterested members of the Company Board of Directors believes in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and with independent financial advisors) constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Competing Transaction, and which proposal was not, directly or indirectly, the result of a breach of Section 5.3, but only to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board of Directors, as determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof after receiving the advice of outside counsel, the Company Board of Directors may, directly or through any of its Representatives, (i) contact such Person and its Representatives for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms thereof and the capability of consummation, so as to determine whether the proposal for a Competing Transaction is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Competing Transaction and (ii) if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith following consultation with its legal and financial advisors that such proposal for a Competing Transaction is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Competing Transaction, the Company Board of Directors may (directly or through its Representatives) (A) furnish nonpublic information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person that made such proposal pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement (with confidentiality terms no less restrictive in the aggregate to the Person making such proposal than the Confidentiality Agreement dated May 9, 2006, between Parent and the Company) with such Person, (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such proposal and (C) subject to Section 5.4(b), following receipt of a proposal for a Competing Transaction that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Competing Transaction, but prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, terminate this Agreement pursuant to, and subject to compliance with, Section 7.1(i) and Section 7.2(b)(iii). Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board of Directors from (1) complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Competing Transaction, (2) issuing a "stop, look and listen" announcement, (3) complying with its disclosure obligations under U. S. federal or state law regarding a Competing Transaction or (4) taking any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take. 

 

 (b) The Company Board of Directors shall not effect any Change in Recommendation or take any action referred to in Section 5.4(a)(ii)(C) unless the Com- pany Board of Directors has (i) given Parent at least three (3) Business Days notice of its intent to take such action and (ii) with respect to an action referred to in Section 5.4(a)(ii)(C) with respect to a Superior Competing Transaction, negotiated with Parent in good faith any amendment to this Agreement proposed by Parent and taken into account any such amendment entered into or to which Parent irrevocably covenants to enter into and for which all internal approvals of Parent have been obtained since receipt of such notice, in each case, prior to the end of such three-Business Day period, and such Superior Competing Transaction thereafter remains a Superior Competing Transaction.

 (a) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP and their respective Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice during the period prior to the Merger Effective Time to all of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (including the Company Data Room), and, during such period, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall, and shall cause each of the other Company Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent all information (financial or otherwise) con- cerning their respective business as Parent, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP may rea- sonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this Section 5.5 to provide Parent, Purchaser Sub, Purchaser LP or their respective repre- sentatives with (i) access to the properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the purpose of invasive physical testing, (ii) any information that the Company rea- sonably believes it may not provide to any of the Purchaser Parties by reason of applica- ble Law or (iii) any information protected by attorney/client privilege. 

 

 (b) Each of Parent, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP will hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with the terms of the letter agreement between the Company and Parent dated as of May 9, 2006 (as it may be amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), other than, for greater certainty, the "Standstill" provisions on page 3 thereof, which shall be of no force or effect after the date hereof. 

 

Section 5.6 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
commercially reason- able efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, appropriate or advisable to fulfill
all conditions applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary, appropriate or ad- visable actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
other third parties and the making of all necessary, appropriate or advisable
registrations, filings and notices and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval, waiver, consent or exemption from any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary, appropriate or
advisable consents, approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-governmental
third parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional documents
or instruments nec- essary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The
parties shall cooperate with each other and promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings (including, to the extent necessary, any notification required by the
HSR Act), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, ap- provals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary, ap-

  propriate or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other
on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, all of the information relating to the Company, the Operating
Partnership or the Purchaser Parties, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with any third party
or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other ap- prised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated herein. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party shall be obligated to offer to divest, hold separate or restrict any
assets or businesses; _pro_ _vided_ , _further_ , that any such offer may be
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company
shall not, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to, engage in any
action or transaction that would materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Com- pany, the Operating Partnership or any of the Purchaser
Parties to consummate the Merger. With respect to any threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as
the case may be. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any such consent or ap- proval will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in obtaining financing
for the Merger, the Partnership Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including by (i) causing its senior executive officers to participate,
at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, in the preparation of offering
circulars or private placement memoranda, in due dili- gence meetings and in
the marketing and sale or any other syndication of any such financings,
including any "roadshow" or other meetings with prospective investors or
financial institutions in connection therewith, (ii) to the extent available,
delivering such financial, statistical and other information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with such financings and (iii) causing its legal counsel to deliver
any legal opinions reasonably requested by the providers of such financing or
their counsel and its inde- pendent accountants to provide such comfort
letters, consents and other services reasonably requested by such providers or
their counsel.

 (a) Parent, Holdings, Purchaser Sub, Purchaser LP, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall report the portions of the transactions contemplated hereby consisting of the Merger in accordance with the treatment contemplated by Sec-

  tion 1.4 and each shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such portions of such transactions to be so treated for U. S. federal
income tax purposes.

 

 (b) Unless required by Law (as evidenced by the legal opinion of a na- tionally recognized U. S. law firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company), neither Parent, Holdings, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP, on the one hand, nor the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the other hand, will take or omit to take any action, prior to the Merger Effective Time, that would jeopardize the Companys status as a REIT under the Code or the status of the Operating Partnership as a partnership for purposes of Taxes for any period. 

 

 (c) Unless prohibited by Law (as evidenced by the legal opinion of a nationally recognized U. S. law firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company), and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, up to the Merger Effective Time, the Company, each Company Subsidiary and any Affiliate of any of them, shall be permitted to take or omit to take any action required to maintain the Companys status as a REIT under the Code or the status of the Operating Partnership as a partnership for purposes of Taxes for any period. The Company shall provide Parent with prior written notice of its intention to take any such action or to omit to take any such action outside the ordinary course of business, and shall consult with Parent in good faith with respect to such action or omission. 

 

 (d) Parent shall, with the Companys good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which become payable in con- nection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than any such Taxes that are solely the responsibility of the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or LP Units under applicable Law (together, with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer and Gains Taxes") . From and after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes (other than any such Taxes that are solely the responsibility of the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or LP Units under applicable Law) without deductions withheld from the Merger Consideration. 

 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company, the Operating Partnership and
Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement or filing without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement or filing as may be required by Law or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to
do so prior to the time such press release or public statement or filing is
required to be released, filed or furnished pursuant to such Law.

  ---|---|--- 

 

 (a) _Continuing Benefits and Compensation_. For a period of not less than one year commencing immediately following the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or cause the Surviving Company to, provide to each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is employed as of the Closing Date (each, a "Company Employee") who remains employed by Parent, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership after the Merger Effective Time compensation and employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are, subject to Section 5.9(d), no less favorable, taken as a whole, than the compensation and employee benefits (other than retention, sale, stay, special bonus or other change in control payments or awards) provided immediately before the Merger Effective Time. During such period, Parent shall, or cause the Surviving Company to, honor in accordance with their terms all benefits and obligations under the Company Employee Benefit Plans, each as in effect on the date hereof. 

 

 (b) _Company Severance Policies_. For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide each Company Employee with severance payments and severance benefits in accordance with the policy set forth in Section 5.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter without any amendment to the terms of such policy during such one-year period, to the extent that any such Company Employee incurs a termination by his or her employer without cause or without good reason entitling such employee to severance under the terms of such policy; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 5.9(b) shall be deemed to modify or limit the provisions of the severance agreements set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Severance Agreements"); _provided_ , _further_ that any transfer of an employee to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent shall not give rise to any severance obligations on the part of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries except to the ex- tent expressly provided otherwise in any binding agreement between such employee and the Company or a Company Subsidiary. 

 

 (c) _Service Credit_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company, to, give each Company Employee full credit for such employees service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and any predecessor employer for whom service is recognized by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (including for purposes of vacation and severance benefits), but not for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans, in each case under any benefit plans of the Surviving Company in which a Company Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under a corresponding benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; _pro_ _vided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. 

 

 (d) _Waivers and Other Matters_. Parent shall make reasonable efforts to (or to cause the Surviving Company to) (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or the Surviving Company that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing Date, other than any limi- 

  tations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing
Date under the analogous Company Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible de- pendents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or the
Surviving Company in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing
Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-
pocket maximums were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability re- quirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing
Date, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent
had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company
Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date.

 

 (e) _Annual Bonus_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay a bonus for the year in which the Closing occurs prorated through the Closing Date (and based on the target bonus in effect for such year) to each Company Employee who is or would be eligible to receive an annual bonus under the Companys annual bo- nus programs including the Performance Incentive Plan (who would meet the service requirements assuming continued participation in such Plan) pursuant to the terms thereof. 

 

 (f) _Long-Term_ _Incentive Plan_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company Board of Directors and/or the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors will terminate all long-term incentive plan performance cycles that have been commenced (and not otherwise paid) prior to the Closing Date, and that as of the Closing Date the Company shall pay out to all eligible participants a total of up to $5 million. 

 

 (g) _No Amendment of ERISA Plan_. Nothing in this Section 5.9 or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended to be or shall be construed as an amendment or modification of any benefit plan under or for purposes of ERISA. 

 

 (h) _Consultant_. After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to retain, as promptly as practicable and until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time, a management consultant reasonably acceptable to Parent on customary terms. 

    Section 5.10   |   | _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers
Insurance_. 
---|---|--- 

 

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (each, an "Action"), in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Merger Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document delivered in connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated 

  hereby, from and after the Merger Effective Time, the Purchaser Parties and
the Surviv- ing Company (together with the Company, the "Indemnitors"), shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent that
a Delaware corporation is permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own
directors and officers, each Indem- nified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settle- ment reasonably
incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party in connection with any such
Action (collectively, "Indemnifiable Amounts"), and in the event of any such
Action, if and to the extent the DGCL permits, the Indemnitors shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, within twenty (20) days of written
request, advance ex- penses incurred by an Indemnified Party in defending any
such Action pending its final disposition.

 

 (b) The Indemnitors shall have the right to defend each Indemnified Party in any Action that may give rise to the payment of Indemnifiable Amounts here- under; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitors shall notify such Indemnified Party of any such decision to defend within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of written notice of any such Action, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitors shall not, without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of any judgment against such Indemnified Party or enter into any settlement or compromise that (i) includes an admission of fault of such Indemnified Party or (ii) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the full release of such Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Action, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indem- nified Party. 

 

 (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(b), if in any Action to which an In- demnified Party is entitled to indemnification under Section 5.10(a), the Indemnitors fail to assume the defense of such Action in a timely manner, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of such Indemnified Partys choice at the expense of the Indemnitors; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Indemnitors shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Indemnitors under this Section 5.10 shall continue after the Closing Date. 

 

 (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.10, upon learning of any such Action, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company, thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Surviving Company except to the extent, if any, that such failure promptly to notify materially and adversely prejudices such party. 

 

 (e) Parent, Purchaser Sub and Purchaser LP agree that all rights to in- demnification and contribution existing in favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of, the Indemnified Parties and all trustees, directors, officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided for in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or any organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, as well as indemnification agreements, as in effect as of the date hereof, with 

  respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time,
including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of at least six (6) years after the Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Company to, use commercially reasonable ef- forts to cause to be
maintained in effect, with respect to any acts and omissions that oc- curred
at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, directors and officers liability
insurance coverage having the same or better terms and conditions as the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying such obligation, none
of Parent or any Purchaser Subsidiary shall be obligated to pay premiums per
annum in excess of 200% of the aggregate amount per annum that the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries paid for such coverage in the last full fiscal year,
which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect in lieu of the foregoing
insur- ance, prior to the Merger Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay for a
policy (providing coverage for the Indemnified Parties and such officers) with
a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or bet- ter credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance in an amount and scope no less favorable than the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Merger Effective Time, provided that the cost thereof does not exceed 300% of
the aggregate amount per annum that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
paid for such coverage in the last full fiscal year. If such "tail" policy has
been obtained by the Company prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and effect
for its full term and shall continue to honor the Com- panys obligations
thereunder.

 

 (f) This Section 5.10 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.10. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.10 that is denied by the Indemnitors, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification, then the Indemnitors shall pay such Indemnified Partys costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against the Indemnitors. 

 

 (g) In the event that the Surviving Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as the case may be, assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

    Section 5.11 _Tax Returns_. After the Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax 
--- 
   Returns required to be filed by the Com- 

  pany Subsidiaries for all periods with the applicable taxing authority on or
before the due date (including extensions, if any) for filing such Tax
Returns.

 

Section 5.12 _Goldman Sachs Loan Assignment_. Concurrently with the execu-
tion of this Agreement, the Company, the Operating Partnership, Parent and
certain of their re- spective Affiliates are entering into a Restated Credit
and Guaranty Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") . Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to purchase the Goldman Sachs Loan from
Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, and in any case by no later than January 31, 2007, for an amount equal
to the par value of the Goldman Sachs Loan plus all accrued interest and fees
(calculated as if the Goldman Sachs Loan were being repaid in full on the date
of purchase), it being understood that, if Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company
desires to use an assignment agreement in the form attached as Exhibit A or
another assignment form containing terms and conditions no less favorable to
Parent than those set forth in such form of assignment agreement, then Parent
shall not be using its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase the Goldman
Sachs Loan if it refuses to execute such assignment agreement because of the
terms and conditions of such assignment agreement. The parties agree that the
purchase of the Goldman Sachs Loan shall occur ten (10) Business Days after
the Com- pany delivers notice requesting such purchase; _provided_ that the
conditions set forth in Section 3.1 of the Credit Agreement are satisfied.
Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such
conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required under this Agreement to take any action or not
take any action if such action or omission would result in a breach of the
Credit Agreement, or a Default or Event of Default (each as defined in the
Credit Agreement), in each case, unless the Company, the Operating Partnership
and its ap- plicable Affiliates shall have received a waiver under the Credit
Agreement for such action or omission. In no event shall the Merger
Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration or the consideration
payable in respect of Preferred Shares, Preferred Units, Company Options, or
Company SARs, or any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement be
reduced for any amounts payable by Parent in respect of the Goldman Sachs
Loan.

 

Section 5.13 _Pre-Acquisition_ __ _Restructuring_.

 

 (a) Parent may request by written notice given to the Company after the date hereof, but at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Parent Instructions"), that each of the Company and the Operating Partnership, as the case may be, shall, prior to the Closing Date, (w) transfer or cause to be transferred all of the stock, partnership interests or limited liability interests or other assets owned, directly or indirectly, by either of them or their respective Subsidiaries to one or more of their respective existing Subsidiaries or to direct or indirect Subsidiaries to be formed after the date hereof by one or both of them, including by way of contribution to such Subsidiaries, all in the manner (including in the order) and at the times specified in the Parent Instructions, (x) otherwise effect a restructuring of its business, assets, operations and Subsidiaries, including (A) making proper elections to treat certain Subsidiaries (i) as corporations, (ii) as partnerships and/or (iii) as REITs, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, (B) merging 

  Subsidiaries into other Subsidiaries and (C) issuing securities to other
Subsidiaries, all in the manner (including in the order) and at the times
specified in the Parent Instructions ((w) and (x) being called the "Pre-
Acquisition Restructuring"), (y) cooperate and cause its Representatives to
cooperate with Parent and its advisers to determine the nature of the Pre-
Acquisition Restructuring and the manner in which it most effectively could be
implemented and (z) work cooperatively with Parent and prepare and execute all
documen- tation (including any management agreements between the Company
and/or its controlled Subsidiaries, and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and
any amendments to any charter documents of any Company Subsidiary) and do all
such other acts and things prior to the Merger Effective Time as are necessary
or desirable to give effect to the Pre-Acquisition Restructuring. The Parent
Instructions also may, at the option of Parent, require that Pur- chaser LP,
rather than the Operating Partnership, be the surviving partnership in the
Partnership Merger, in which case the Surviving Partnership shall be Purchaser
LP for all purposes hereof and the parties hereto shall amend this Agreement,
including the Recitals hereto and Section 1.4, to the extent necessary to give
effect to such change.

 

 (b) Parent covenants and agrees that the Pre-Acquisition Restructuring shall (i) not delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) be implemented as close as possible to the last moment of the Business Day next preceding the Closing Date or, to the extent specified in the Parent Instructions, immediately prior to the Closing (but in any case only after Parent shall have waived or confirmed in writing to the Company that all conditions to the obligations of Parent to consummate the Closing (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied), (iii) not require the Company or the Operating Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries to take any action in contravention of any Law, (iv) not affect or modify in any respect the obligations of the Purchaser Parties under this Agreement and (v) except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 5.13(b), not change or alter any of the consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Shares or LP Units in the Merger or the Partnership Merger, or change or alter any of the tax consequences of the Merger or the Partnership Merger to the holders of Company Common Shares or LP Units. Parent shall promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the Company and the Operating Partnership for all out-of-pocket costs to be incurred by either of them in connection with any actions taken by either of them in accordance with this Section 5.13 (including the fees and expenses of their Representatives). The Purchaser Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Operating Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with or as a result of taking such actions. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company and the Operating Partnership shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the transactions requested by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.13. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Pre-Acquisition Re- structuring may change the consideration to be received in the Partnership Merger by any holders of any LP Units with respect to which a Roll-Over Election is made from units in the Surviving Partnership to units in one or more Subsidiaries of the Surviving Partnership that are limited partnerships; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Subsidiaries of the Surviving Partnership taken as a whole shall have substantially the same assets and liabilities 

  (other than obligations pursuant to any management agreement) that the
Surviving Partnership would have had the Pre-Acquisition Restructuring not
occurred.

 

 Section 5.14 _Future Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to any fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall consult on a timely basis with Parent in the Companys and the Operating Partnerships defense in any stockholder litigation (other than any litigation where the interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates are adverse to those of Parent or any of its Affiliates) against the Company and any litigation (other than any litigation where the interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates are adverse to those of Parent or any of its Affiliates) by any holder of LP Units against the Com- pany or the Operating Partnership, in either case, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

 Section 5.15 _Comfort Letter_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent "comfort" letters of the Companys independent public accountants, dated as of the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and as of the Merger Effective Time, and addressed to the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and reasonably customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in con- nection with transactions such as those contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the "comfort" letter of the Companys independent public accountants, dated as of the Merger Effec- tive Time, shall not be delivered to the Company, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article II, Parent shall not be obligated to allow the Company Common Shares to be con- verted into the Stock Consideration and instead all Stock Elections shall be deemed to be Cash Elections and the Private Holding Company Scenario shall be deemed in effect for all purposes of this Agreement. 

 

 Section 5.16 _Compliance with the Securities Act_. The Company shall (i) not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a list identifying all Persons that, at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, in the Companys reasonable judgment, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company, as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"), and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Rule 145 Affiliate to deliver to Parent on or prior to the Merger Effective Time a written agreement in customary form reasonably acceptable to Parent, executed by such person. 

    Section 5.17 _Notices of Certain Events_. 
--- 
   The Company shall promptly notify Parent after receiving or becoming
aware: 

 

 (a) of any notice or other communication from any Person (i) alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) making allegations which, if true, would cause any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect;

  (b) of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 (c) of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

 (d) of any notice or Knowledge that (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" has become untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; (ii) any party hereto has failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; or (iii) there has occurred any event that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to perform by the Company of its
obligations under this Section 5.17 shall not be a condition to (1) the
Purchaser Parties obligation to effect the Mergers and to consummate the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as set forth in Section
6.2(b), or (2) a basis on which Parent may terminate this Agreement under
Section 7.1(d), in each case except to the extent that such failure to perform
shall have resulted in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 (v) if this Agreement is terminated for any other reason (other than by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c) (Breach by Purchaser Party)), then the Company will pay to Parent, or as directed by Parent, the Expenses on the date of such termination.

    (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Break-Up Fee" shall be an

 Section 7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties only by a written instrument executed and delivered by Parent and the Company, by action of their respective board of directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made that would require the approval of the Company Common Stockholders or partners of the Operating Partnership holding LP Units without obtaining such approval.

At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company (on behalf of itself and the Operating Partnership) and Parent (on behalf of itself and the other Purchaser Parties) may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Purchaser Parties (in the case of the Company) or the Company and the Operating Partnership (in the case of the Purchaser Parties), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Purchaser Parties (in the case of the Company) or the Company and the Operating Partnership (in the case of the Purchaser Parties) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions of the Purchaser Parties (in the case of the Company) or the Company and the Operating Partnership (in the case of the Purchaser Parties) contained in this Agreement.
