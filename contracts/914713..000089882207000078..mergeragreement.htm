Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect in lieu of the foregoing insur- ance, prior to the Merger Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay for a policy (providing coverage for the Indemnified Parties and such officers) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or bet- ter credit rating as the Company&#146;s current insurance carrier with respect to directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance in an amount and scope no less favorable than the Company&#146;s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, provided that the cost thereof does not exceed 300% of the aggregate amount per annum that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries paid for such coverage in the last full fiscal year. If such &#147;tail&#148; policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and effect for its full term and shall continue to honor the Com- pany&#146;s obligations thereunder. </FONT></P>

If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.10 that is denied by the Indemnitors, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification, then the Indemnitors shall pay such Indemnified Party&#146;s costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against the Indemnitors. </FONT></P>
