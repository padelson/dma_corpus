 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " ** _Agreement_**
"), dated as of July 30, 2013, is by and among Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Company_** "), Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), and PDRS Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger Sub_** ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company has approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " ** _Merger_** ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and each of the respective boards of directors of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company has approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 



 

 _1.1._ _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " ** _DGCL_** "), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** "), and the separate corporate existence of
the Company, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in
Article II. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

 



 

 _1.2._ _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York, at 9:00 A.M. on the second Business Day, or such other place
and time mutually agreed upon and specified in writing by the parties (such
specified date, the " ** _Closing Date_** "), following the day on which the
last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " ** _Business Day_** " shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 _1.3._ _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " ** _Delaware Certificate of
Merger_** ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed upon by the parties in writing
and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " ** _Effective
Time_** ").

 



 

 _1.4._ _Subsequent Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, that any deeds,
bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws 
of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

 _2.1._ _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company (the " ** _Charter_** ") shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set
forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, and such amended and restated Charter shall
become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

 _2.2._ _The By-Laws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth on
_Exhibit B_ hereto and shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the
" ** _By-Laws_** "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

 _3.1._ _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws.

 



 

 _3.2._ _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the By-Laws.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

 



 

 _4.1._ _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (each a " ** _Share_** " and, collectively,
the " ** _Shares_** ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) Shares and shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (if any), in each case, owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
and Shares owned by the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" ** _Dissenting
Stockholders_** ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " ** _Excluded Share_** "
and, collectively, " ** _Excluded Shares_** ")) shall be converted into the
right to receive both (i) an amount in cash equal to $10.75, without interest
(the **" _Closing Amount_ "**), and (ii) one contingent value right (a **"
_CVR_ "**), which shall represent the right to receive the Payment Amounts (as
such term is used in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Annex B (the **" _CVR Agreement_ "**) to be entered into
between Parent and a rights agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the **"
_Rights Agent_ "**)), if any, at the times provided for in the CVR Agreement,
without interest (the Closing Amount and one CVR

 



      
 

 



 

together are collectively referred to herein as the " ** _Per Share Merger
Consideration_** "). Each CVR issued as Per Share Merger Consideration
hereunder will be substantially in the form attached as Annex A to the CVR
Agreement (the " ** _CVR Certificate_** "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " ** _Certificate_** ") formerly representing
any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(f).

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

 _4.2._ _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with StockTrans, Inc. or another bank or trust company
selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " ** _Paying Agent_** "), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) a cash amount in immediately available
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Closing Amounts for
the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) and (ii) CVR Certificates
representing the aggregate number of CVRs issuable pursuant to the CVR
Agreement (such cash and CVR Certificates being hereinafter referred to as the
" ** _Exchange Fund_** "). The agreement with the Paying Agent pursuant to
which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
held in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
Closing Amounts as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Fund, and any cash amounts in excess of the aggregate Closing Amounts
payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e))
(reduced by any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. All stock transfer Taxes and any other Taxes required by reason
of a payment hereunder to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate shall be paid by the Person requesting or receiving such payment
and in the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Closing
Amounts in immediately available funds and the CVR Certificates to which the
holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV (including
Section 4.2(g)).

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after

 



      
 

 



 

giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " **
_Person_** " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 5.4(a)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Closing Amounts in immediately available funds and the CVR Certificates with
respect thereto (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)).

 



 

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has duly perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by
such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such Persons right to appraisal of such Shares under the DGCL. Each
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting
Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
notices of intent, written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that
are received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal of holders of
Shares and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause the Paying Agent
or other applicable withholding agent to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it reasonably determines it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " ** _Code_** "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so

 



      
 

 



 

withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement or other applicable agreements as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 _4.3._ _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
option to purchase Shares (a " ** _Company Option_** ") under the Stock Plans
(as defined in Section 5.2(a)), vested or unvested, shall vest (to the extent
not previously vested) and be converted into the right of the holder to
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount
in cash with respect to each of the Shares subject to the Company Option equal
to the excess, if any, of the last reported sale price of a Share on Nasdaq
(as defined in Section 5.1(h)) on the last day prior to the Effective Time on
which Shares traded over the per Share exercise price of the Company Option,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment
pursuant to Section 4.2(g). In the case of any Company Option that remained
subject to performance goals as of the date of this Agreement, such
performance goals shall be deemed to have been met such that the maximum
number of Shares subject to the Company Option are earned and included in the
payment pursuant to the prior sentence.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any
kind, contingent or accrued, vested or unvested, to acquire or receive Shares
or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind
consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or
reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans (as
defined in Section 5.8(a)), other than Company Options (the " ** _Company
Awards_** "), shall vest (to the extent not previously vested) and be
converted into the right of the holder to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to each of the Shares subject to the Company Award, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment pursuant to Section
4.2(g). In the case of any Company Award that remained subject to performance
goals as of the date of this Agreement, such performance goals shall be deemed
to have been met such that the maximum number of Shares subject to the Company
Award are earned and included in the payment pursuant to the prior sentence.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions that are necessary
(i) to cause the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and any
other Company employee stock purchase plan (any such plans, the " ** _ESPP_**
") not to commence any new offering period to purchase Shares that would
otherwise begin after the date of this Agreement, (ii) to provide that only
participants in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may continue to
participate in the ESPP for the remainder of the current offering period,
(iii) to provide that no participant in the ESPP may increase his or her rate
of payroll deductions used to purchase Shares under the ESPP for the remainder

 



      
 

 



 

of the current offering period, and (iv) to cause the ESPP to terminate
effective as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company (the **" _Company Board_ "**) and the
compensation, nominating and corporate governance committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and
4.3(c).

 



 

 _4.4._ _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be ratably adjusted.

 _5.2._ _Capital Structure_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (A) 150,000,000
Shares, of which 48,890,405 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on July 26, 2013; and (B) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of which none were outstanding as of the close of
business on July 26, 2013. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the
close of business on July 29, 2013, other than 10,445,945 Shares reserved or
available for issuance under the Companys 1998 Stock Plan, 2006 Equity
Incentive Plan, 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and ESPP (collectively, the " **
_Stock Plans_** "), and subject to the transactions contemplated by Section
7.13, the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. Section 5.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of options,
restricted stock units and all other Company Awards outstanding under the
Stock Plans as of July 29, 2013, including the holder, date of grant,
governing Stock Plan, term, number of Shares and, where applicable, exercise
price. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " ** _Lien_** ").
Except as set forth above and for any awards under the Stock Plans after the
date of this Agreement, except for the rights (the " ** _Rights_** ") issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of February 26, 2013, between the
Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the " ** _Rights
Agreement_** "), and except for preferred stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement there are, and as of the Closing Date there will be, no preemptive
or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind

 



      
 

 



 

that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, sell,
redeem or repurchase any shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any
securities of the Company, and no securities or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of
any Liens. Except for preferred stock issued pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the holders of
Shares on any matter.

 



 

(b) Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each of the
Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in each such
Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons
in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital
stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any
other Person other than securities in a publicly traded company held for
investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less
than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company. The Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that requires
an additional filing by Parent under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " ** _HSR Act_** ").

 



 

 _5.3._ _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, subject
only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting
duly called and held for such purpose (the " ** _Company Requisite Vote_** ").
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles (the " ** _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_** ").

 



 

(b) The Company Board has (A) determined that the terms of the Merger are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and holders of Shares, approved
and declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions
and resolved, subject to Section 7.2 hereof, to recommend that the holders of
Shares consummate the Merger and adopt this Agreement (such recommendation,
the " ** _Company Recommendation_** ") and, as of the date hereof, none of
such actions by the Company Board has been amended, rescinded or modified; and
(B) received the opinions

 



      
 

 



 

of its financial advisors, J.P. Morgan Chase and Co. and Centerview Partners
LLC, to the effect that the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, as of the date of such opinions, to such holders
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of Shares. It is understood and
agreed that such opinions are for the benefit of the Company Board and may not
be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
shall forward to Parent, solely for informational purposes, a copy of the
written version of such opinions, promptly following the execution of this
Agreement and in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 6.8, the Company Board has taken all action so that
Parent will not be an "interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering
into or consummating a "business combination" with the Company (in each case
as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions in the manner and to
ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL will not impose any additional procedural,
voting, approval, fairness or other restrictions on the timely consummation of
the Transactions or restrict, impair or delay the ability of (i) Parent or
Merger Sub to engage in any of the Transactions with the Company or (ii)
Parent or Merger Sub, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, to
vote or otherwise exercise all rights as a holder of Shares.

 



 

 _5.4._ _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Other than (i) the filings and/or notices pursuant to Section 1.3, (ii)
compliance with applicable requirements under the HSR Act, (iii) compliance
with applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the **" _Exchange Act_ "**) including the filing of the Proxy
Statement, in connection with the Company Requisite Vote, and (iv) compliance
with applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq, no notices, reports or other
filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by
the Company from, any domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory
authority, agency, commission, body, court or other legislative, executive or
judicial governmental entity (each, a " ** _Governmental Entity_** "), in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, the
failure of which to make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will
not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under,
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable
governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a grant of rights to any
third party under any Specified Contract or a creation of obligations for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Specified Contract, in addition
to those obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect on

 



      
 

 



 

the date of this Agreement not otherwise terminable by the other party thereto
without penalty upon 30 days notice, (iii) a breach or violation of, a
termination (or right of termination) or default pursuant to any Specified
Contract (as defined in Section 5.10(a)(x)) not otherwise terminable by the
other party thereto without penalty upon 30 days notice or less, (iv) the
creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens (as defined below)) on any
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (v) assuming (solely with respect
to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions) compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.4(a) and
Section 5.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, a violation under any Law to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case
of clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above, for any such breach, violation,
termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that is not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, " ** _Permitted Liens_** " means (i) Liens
arising out of or resulting from Taxes, assessments or governmental charges or
levies not yet due and payable or are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, (ii) Liens resulting from a precautionary filing by a
lessor with respect to a lease, (iii) Liens imposed by Law, such as carriers,
warehousemens and mechanics liens and other similar liens arising in the
ordinary course of business which secure payment of obligations not more than
60 days past due or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, (iv) purchase money security interests for the purchase or
leasing of office equipment, computers, vehicles and other items of tangible
personal property, (v) in the case of real property, zoning, building,
subdivision, environmental, entitlement or other land use regulations, (vi) in
the case of real property, easements, quasi-easements, encumbrances, licenses,
covenants, rights-of-way, rights of re-entry or other restrictions and similar
agreements, conditions or restrictions or Liens that would be shown by a
current title report or other similar report or listing or by a current survey
or physical inspection, and (vii) any other Liens which are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

 _5.5._ _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis
(taking into account all applicable extensions and grace periods), all forms,
statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " ** _Securities Act_** "), since December 31,
2010 (the " ** _Applicable Date_** ") (the forms, statements, reports and
documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or

individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

principles and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the asset of the Company, (ii) provide

preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are

of the Company Board any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves

internal control over financial reporting. Any matters described in (x) or (y)
above are described in Section 5.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Any
material change in internal control over financial reporting and any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any

the SEC since the Applicable Date has been so disclosed and the Company has
taken reasonable steps to remediate each significant deficiency and material
weakness previously so disclosed.

 



 

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in, or incorporated by
reference into, the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income (loss), operations, stockholders equity and cash flows

normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect), in each case (i) in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted therein and (ii) such consolidated financial statements,

(e) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for

date it is first mailed to the holders of Shares or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, Delaware law and any other applicable
Laws, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein. The Company will include in their
entirety, as well as a fair summary of the analysis

 



      
 

 



 

underlying, the fairness opinions of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Centerview
Partners LLP in the Proxy Statement, including any amendments thereof and
supplements thereto.

(a) There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings (collectively, "
** _Proceedings_** ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

exhibits to or information incorporated by reference therein, or in the
corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by
Parent prior to entering into this Agreement (the " ** _Parent Disclosure
Letter_** ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent, and
that the mere inclusion of an item in such Parent Disclosure Letter shall not
be deemed an admission that such item is material or has had, would have, or
would be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as

warrant to the Company that:

conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially impede or delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions (a " ** _Parent Material Adverse
Effect_** "). Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct
copy of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Parent and Merger Sub,
each as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other Transactions, except those that the failure to make or
obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of,

Disclosure Letter, a violation under any Law to which the Parent or Merger Sub
or their respective Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause

hereof) or otherwise individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity
which is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

documents or material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in any due
diligence materials provided to Parent or Merger Sub, except in the case of

 _7.2._ _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 7.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall instruct and shall use its best efforts to cause its
and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors, agents or representatives (such directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors,
agents, or representatives, collectively, " ** _Representatives_** ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) initiate, knowingly facilitate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or

 



 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or make available any non-public
information or data to any Person relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating

 



      
 

 



 

to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify such Person of the existence of this Section 7.2.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the date
on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may (A) provide
information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made a
written Acquisition Proposal providing for the acquisition of more than 50% of
the assets (on a consolidated basis), or total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company if, and only if, (i) the Company receives from the
Person so requesting such information, an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms not less restrictive to the other party in any material respect than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 10.7)
(it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
"standstill" provision or otherwise prohibit the making, or amendment, of an
Acquisition Proposal, but it may not restrict the Company from complying with
this Section 7.2(a)) and (ii) the Company promptly (and in any event within
thirty-six (36) hours of providing such information) discloses (and, if
applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the extent
not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an Acquisition Proposal,
subject to the conditions contained in clause (A)(i)-(ii) above; or (C)
ascertain facts from the party making such Acquisition Proposal for the
purpose of informing the Company Board about the Acquisition Proposal and the
party making such Acquisition Proposal, in each such case referred to in
clause (A) or (B) above, if and only if the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within thirty-six (36) hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing of the
receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) any inquiry or
request for discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of any decision of the
Company Board to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or to disclose or furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal to any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly as
practicable after such determination was reached (and in any event no later
than thirty-six (36) hours after such determination was reached). The Company
will (i) provide Parent with the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any amendments thereto,
(ii) promptly (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours of receiving such
information) provide Parent a copy of all written information provided by or
on behalf of such Person or group in connection with any Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal or provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives to
such Person or group, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, and
(iii) promptly (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours of such
determination) notify Parent of any determination by the Company Board that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date hereof that would restrict the Companys
ability to provide to Parent the information set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, and, if the Company is a party to any agreement as of the date hereof
that would prohibit the Company from providing such information to Parent,
prior to providing non-public information to, or engaging in discussions or
negotiations with, the counterparty to such agreement, the Company will obtain
approval from the counterparty to such agreement to allow the Company to
provide such information to Parent.

 



 

(c) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " means (i) any bona fide proposal, offer or
effort made by any Person with respect to a merger, joint venture,
partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, exchange
offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) any acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal, effort or offer,
which if consummated would result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner
of directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 15% or
more of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company or
those of any of its Subsidiaries, or 15% or more of the consolidated total
assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in
each case other than the Transactions.

 



 

" ** _Superior Proposal_** " means an Acquisition Proposal that would result
in any person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more
than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of
Shares from a financial point of view than the Transactions.

 



 

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
Company Board, and each committee of the Company Board, shall not:

 



 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; (B) other than as set forth
in clause (D) of this Section 7.2(d)(i), fail to reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of a written request by Parent to
do so or, if earlier, the later of two (2) Business Days prior to the
Stockholders Meeting or five (5) Business Days after the public announcement
of any

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal or other event material to the Company Recommendation;
(C) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt, or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal; or (D) in the event of a tender offer or exchange
offer for any outstanding Shares, fail to recommend against acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer by the holders of Shares within ten (10)
Business Days of the commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act (any action described in clauses (A)-(D), a " ** _Change of
Recommendation_** "); or

 



 

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 7.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 7.2(a)) (an " **
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_** ") relating to, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) if
(x) the Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, without
any director or Section 16 officer of the Company having participated in a
material breach of the Companys obligations contained in this Section 7.2,
(y) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (z) the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that a failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then, prior to the date on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained,
the Company Board may (A) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or (B)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b) to cause the Company to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning the Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this sentence and any such purported termination shall be void and
of no force or effect unless, in advance of or concurrently with such
termination, the Company substantially simultaneously with such termination
enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning the Superior
Proposal and (ii) nothing shall prohibit or restrict the Company or the
Company Board, in circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, from
effecting a Change of Recommendation prior to the date on which the Company
Requisite Vote is obtained if the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that a failure to do so would
violate the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under applicable Law;
_provided_ that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (i) unless (A) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Parent at least one hundred (100) hours in advance (the **"
_Notice Period_ "**) of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal pursuant to clause (i) or otherwise make a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to clause (i), which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such

 



      
 

 



 

Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party marking such Superior
Proposal) or the reasons for such Change of Recommendation in the absence of a
Superior Proposal, as the case may be, (B) prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall direct its outside legal counsel and financial advisors to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
the Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) following the Notice Period (and giving
effect to any proposed adjustments to the terms of this Agreement) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor (in the case of clause (i) below) that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or (ii) the failure to make
such Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event of any amendment to the
financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal or material
changes to the facts and circumstances necessitating such Change of
Recommendation after the start of the Notice Period, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply again with
the requirements of this Section 7.2(d) with respect to such new written
notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the date
of such new notice, except that the Companys advance written notice
obligation shall be reduced to seventy-two (72) hours (rather than the one
hundred (100) hours otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.2(d)) and the
time the Company shall be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the time that is
seventy-two (72) hours after it has provided such written notice (rather than
the time that is the one hundred (100) hours otherwise contemplated by this
Section 7.2(d)).

 



 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making
any disclosure to the holders of Shares if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consulting with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure could be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (iii) making
disclosure to the holders of Shares of factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub, or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the
identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms
of such Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure set forth in (iii) above
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board shall not make a Change of Recommendation except in
accordance with Section 7.2(d). For the sake of clarity, any such disclosure
set forth in (i) and (ii) above that constitutes a Change of Recommendation
under Section 7.2(d)(i) shall result in all of the consequences of a Change of
Recommendation as set forth in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will, and it will take
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations commenced prior to, or pending as of, the date
hereof, with any parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will request each Person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement on or after February 27, 2013 in
connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

 _7.3._ _Stockholders Meeting_. As promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to set the
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting
of the holders of Shares (the " ** _Stockholders Meeting_** ") to consider and
vote upon adoption of this Agreement (with the record date and meeting date
set by the Company after consulting with Parent), and shall not postpone or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting unless the Company and Parent determine that
it is necessary or advisable to do so in order to solicit additional proxies
in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote or to comply with applicable
Law. The Company Board shall recommend such adoption (unless a Change of
Recommendation shall have occurred). Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause all
Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
to be present at the Stockholders Meeting and to be voted at the Stockholders
Meeting in favor of adoption of this Agreement.

Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions, or
changes thereto suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with
respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto, or for additional information, and shall provide to Parent, after
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall have had a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and draft correspondence and due
consideration has been given to such comments by the Company, copies of all
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC. The Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to promptly
provide satisfactory responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable after the
date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon, or that
the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) _CVR Agreement; Registration Statements; Listing of CVRs_.

 



 

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the CVR Agreement to
be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Parent and the Rights Agent.

_provided_ , that the Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review each Registration Statement before it is filed with the
SEC and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions, or changes thereto suggested by the Company and its
counsel. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt of all
comments of the SEC with respect to the Registration Statements and of any
request by the SEC for any amendments or supplements thereto, or for
additional information, and shall provide to the Company, after the Company
and its counsel shall have had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Registration Statements and draft correspondence and due consideration
has been given to such comments by Parent, copies of all correspondence
between Parent and Merger and/or any of their Representatives, one the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other. The Company and Parent shall each use
reasonable best efforts to promptly provide satisfactory responses to the SEC
with respect to all comments received on the Registration Statements, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon, cause the Registration

the CVR Agreement qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. Parent and Merger
Sub shall cause the Registration Statements to remain effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and to comply
with Parents obligations under the CVR Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice,
after the time when the Registration Statements have been declared effective,
of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of
the CVRs. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates is discovered by Parent that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statements so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and to the extent
required by law, Parent shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC.

 



 

(iv) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall prepare
and submit to Nasdaq an application covering the CVRs and shall use its

Time, to continue to use reasonable best efforts, from and after the Effective
Time, to obtain such listing approval until it is received.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws, to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other Transactions as soon as practicable, including (i)

information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions (including the Proxy

other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as

promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its
Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger and the other Transactions. Neither the Company nor Parent shall
permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to

on a current basis of any communication received by such party from, or given
by, any Government Antitrust Entity, in each case, regarding any of the
Transactions; and (C) permit the other party and its counsel to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, any Government Antitrust Entity, and to the extent
permitted by the Government

 



      
 

 



 

Antitrust Entity, give the other party and its counsel the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences;

 



 

(iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful, or that would prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, any
and all steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond, but
excluding the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (iv) of this
paragraph) necessary to vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, eliminate or remove
such actual injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) the prompt taking of any and all actions (the sequencing of which shall
lie in the reasonable discretion of Parent) necessary to avoid the entry of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions, including the
defense through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court,
agency or other proceeding by any person or entity, including any Governmental
Entity, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Transactions and the proffer and agreement by Parent of
its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease,
license, disposal and holding separate of, any assets, rights, product lines,
licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests
therein, of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (and
the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action should be
necessary to (x) eliminate the actual issuance of any order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment that would delay, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions by any
Government Antitrust Entity or (y) cause the Closing to occur prior to April
30, 2014.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 7.4(f) as "Antitrust Counsel
Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside counsel regarding Antitrust Law of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (the Company or Parent as the case

 



      
 

 



 

may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.4(f), materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company.

 



 

 _7.5._ _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford
Parents officers and other authorized representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose or
permit access to any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the
Company is reasonably likely to result in any violation of any Law or any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or cause
any privilege (including attorney client privilege) that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information, or (ii) if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation or other proceeding, to disclose or permit access to
any information that is reasonably pertinent to such litigation or other
proceeding. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 7.5
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 _7.6._ _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cooperate with the Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Shares
under the Exchange Act promptly after the Effective Time. Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to file
with the SEC (a) a Form 25 on the Closing Date and (b) a Form 15 on the first
business day that is at least ten (10) days after the date the Form 25 is
filed (such period between the Form 25 filing date and the Form 15 filing
date, the **" _Delisting Period_ "**). If the Surviving Corporation is
reasonably likely to be required to file any quarterly or annual reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the Company will
deliver to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing a
draft, which is sufficiently developed such that it can be timely filed with a
reasonable amount of effort within the time available, of any such reports
reasonably likely to be required to be filed during the Delisting Period ( **"
_Post-Closing SEC Reports_ "**). The Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the
Company pursuant to this Section 7.6 will (i) not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

 



      
 

 



 

therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Laws.

 



 

 _7.7._ _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Transactions
shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent, and thereafter, so
long as this Agreement is in effect, unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred, the Company and Parent each shall consult with
each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and prior
to making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of
the other party, each party may disseminate material substantially similar to
material included in a press release or other document previously approved for
external distribution by the other parties. Each party agrees to promptly make
available to the other parties copies of any written communications made
without prior consultation with the other parties.

 



 

 _7.8._ _Employee Benefits_. (a) Parent agrees that, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, without limiting Section 7.8(c), Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, with respect to each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who continues
to be employed by the Surviving Corporation (each, a " ** _Continuing
Employee_** "), (i) base salary at a rate no less than the rate of the
Continuing Employees base salary on the date hereof and (ii) retirement,
health, welfare and fringe benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly situated Parent employees
based on levels of responsibility.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, accrual of severance, vacation and sick time
benefits and eligibility to participate under the employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
Continuing Employees after the Effective Time (including the Benefit Plans, to
the extent applicable) (the " ** _New Plans_** "), each Continuing Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to receive credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
Parent will use reasonable best efforts to prevent any lapse in

 



      
 

 



 

coverage, whether under such New Plan or a predecessor Benefit Plan, for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents and to cause any waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents. Parent shall also
use reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time ending on the date such
Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
recognized and credited under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year.

 



 

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to take all actions necessary
to expressly assume the Benefit Plans identified in Section 7.8(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(d) _The parties intend_ that this Merger will qualify as a "change in
control" or "change of control" (or the equivalent) for purposes of the
Benefit Plans identified in Section 7.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan for purposes of
ERISA, or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of any Benefit
Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement, (ii) subject
to Section 7.8(b), limit the right of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, New
Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the Effective
Time or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary or other right in any Person,
including any current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company, any participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit
plan, agreement or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof).

 



 

 _7.9._ _Expenses_. Except for withholding, transfer or other similar Taxes
and as provided in Section 9.5, whether or not Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

 



 

 _7.10._ _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted to under applicable
Law and its certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or indemnification
agreements, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, indemnify and hold
harmless, (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable

 



      
 

 



 

law and contemplated by the Company Charter, Company By-Laws, and
indemnification agreements as in effect on the date hereof). Without limiting
the preceding sentence, Parent shall also, to the fullest extent that Parent
is permitted to under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and Parent
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law), except for matters arising out of FCPA Matters; _provided_
that, in the cases of the two preceding sentences, the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification as described in applicable indemnification
agreements), each person who was a director or officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time) (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elect not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall advance all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;
_provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one form of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
prior written consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately

 



      
 

 



 

determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law. If such indemnity is not available with respect
to any Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to) obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only
for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies
also include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " ** _D andO Insurance_**"), with benefits
and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% (the **" _Maximum Premium_ "**) of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to, maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best
efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of the
Maximum Premium; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, for a cost not
exceeding such Maximum Premium.

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with, or merge into, any other
corporation or entity, and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is an intended third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under
this Section 7.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 7.10
applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law, or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to
such termination or modification.

 



 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.10, shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws or comparable governing documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 



 

 _7.11._ _Other Actions by the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all
necessary action to cause the Rights to cease to be outstanding as of the
Effective Time and to terminate the Rights Agreement, effective immediately as
of the Effective Time, without payment of any consideration in respect
thereof, other than the redemption price of $0.01 per Right.

 



 

(b) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is, or may become applicable
to, the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 



 

 _7.12._ _Notification of Certain Litigation_. The Company shall, as promptly
as practicable under the circumstances, after it has notice of any of the
following notify the Parent of actions, suits, claims, Governmental
Investigations or proceedings instituted or threatened in writing against the
Company or any of its directors, officers or Affiliates, including by any
stockholder of the Company (by any stockholder and relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, the **"Stockholder Litigation"** ),
before any court or Governmental Entity, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company, any Company Affiliates, or any Company Subsidiaries
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in
connection with such transactions. The Parent shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings under clause (iii) above, the Company shall consult with Parent
regarding the defense of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings, and the Company may not settle or compromise any Stockholder
Litigation without the prior written consent of the Parent, not to be

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably withheld. The Company shall, taking into consideration the then
existing circumstances, promptly notify Parent in the event that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries obtains Knowledge of any facts which would cause
(i) the recall, market withdrawal or replacement of any product sold or
intended to be sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) a change in the
marketing classification or a material change in labeling of any such
products; or (iii) a termination or suspension of marketing of any such
products.

 



 

 _7.13._ _Interim Financing_. Promptly following the date hereof, Parent and
the Company shall take in good faith all reasonably necessary actions to
implement, and shall implement, the terms regarding interim financing to the
Company on the terms set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto.

(x) 30 days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and
(y) the Outside Date; or

 



 

(b) at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting if the Company has received
a Superior Proposal, which, after giving effect to all of the adjustments that
may be offered by Parent, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors) that such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company shall
not have violated or breached any of its obligations under Section 7.2.

 



 

 _9.4._ _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent upon
delivery of written notice to the Company if (a) the Company Board shall have
made a Change of Recommendation, (b) the Company Board shall have failed to
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of any written request to do so from Parent or, if earlier, the later
of two (2) Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting or five (5)
Business Days after the public announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or
other event material to the Company Recommendation, or (c)

 



      
 

 



 

there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty
shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform will cause any condition to Closing not to be satisfied and
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) 30 days
after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (y) the
Outside Date.

 



 

 _9.5._ _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b) below, in the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article IX, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of
any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_
, _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
that: (i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability
or damages to the other party hereto resulting from fraud or any willful
material breach of this Agreement; (ii) the provisions set forth in this
Section 9.5 and the second sentence of Section 10.1 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement; and (iii) no termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(a) (
_Change of Recommendation_ ) or 9.4(b) ( _Failure to Reaffirm_ );

 



 

(ii) (x) before obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, this Agreement is
terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.2(c) ( _Failure
to Obtain Company Requisite Vote_ ) or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section
9.4(c) ( _Company Breach_ ), (y) any Person shall have made an Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such termination and
such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to such
termination and (z) within 12 months of such termination, the Company shall
have consummated a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal
(substituting in both instances "50%" for "15%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal"); or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(b) (
_Superior Proposal_ );

 



 

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) of this Section 9.5(b),
no later than five Business Days after the date of such termination, (B) in
the case of clause (ii) of this Section 9.5(b), on or prior to the date on
which the Company consummates the Acquisition Proposal referred to in
subclause (ii)(z) of this Section 9.5(b), and (C) in the case of clause (iii)
of this Section 9.5(b), prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition to,
such termination, pay Parent a fee of $18,000,000 (the " ** _Termination
Fee_** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If Parent receives and accepts the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
9.5(b) (and the Company shall offer the Parent an opportunity to decline to
accept the Termination Fee), Parents receipt of the Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and
its Representatives for any and all losses and damages suffered in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions or as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, provided that in the event Parent and Merger
Sub fails to deliver written notice to the Company accepting the Termination
Fee within five Business Days of the date that the Company delivers written
notice to Parent and Merger Sub of their opportunity to accept the Termination
Fee, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be entitled to receive the Termination
Fee, and in such case, Parents and Merger Subs sole remedy against the
Company and its Representatives shall be damages from the Company for any loss
suffered as a direct result of any breach of this Agreement by the Company.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 9.5(b) are
an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Payment of the
Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds if Parent shall have furnished to the Company
appropriate wire payment instructions prior to the date of payment or,
otherwise, by certified or official bank check. In no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. If the Company fails to
promptly make any payment required under this Section, and Parent commences a
suit to collect such payment that results in a judgment against the Company
for the fee set forth in Section 9.5(b), the Company shall indemnify Parent
for its fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such suit and shall pay interest on the amount of
the payment at the prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors or
assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable pursuant to this
Section 9.5(b).

Agreement; Registration Statements; Listing of CVRs_ ) 7.8 ( _Employee
Benefits_ ), 7.9 ( _Expenses_ ) and 7.10 ( _Indemnification; Directors  and

Abandonment_ ) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination
of this Agreement. All other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the Merger
or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 _10.2._ _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the
applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
may

 



      
 

 



 

modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by
duly authorized officers of the respective parties.

 



 

 _10.3._ _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted
by applicable Laws.

 



 

 _10.4._ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or other means of electronic transmission (such as via portable
document format (.pdf)) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart.

 



 

 _10.5._ _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE_. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL
RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW
PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO
ANOTHER JURISDICTION. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts,
or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts; the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, proceeding or
Transactions shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal
court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties, and to the extent permitted by law, over the
subject matter of such dispute, and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 10.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR

 



      
 

 



 

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.5.

 



 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that
irreparable damage would likewise occur if any of the Transactions were not
consummated and the Companys stockholders did not receive the aggregate
consideration payable to them in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement). It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement, and to enforce specifically, the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (including the
obligation of the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions and the
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to pay, and the right of holders of Shares
to receive, the aggregate consideration payable to them pursuant to the
Transactions, in each case in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (i) the Company has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. To the extent any party hereto
brings an action, suit or proceeding to specifically enforce the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to
specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this
Agreement) when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the
twentieth Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or
proceeding, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action, suit or proceeding.

 



 

 _10.6._ _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

 _10.7._ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto),
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated April
15, 2013, between Parent and the Company (the " ** _Confidentiality
Agreement_** ") constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES OR RELIES
ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY,
OR MADE AVAILABLE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR
IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR
DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR
OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. No party
shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged representation, promise,
inducement or statement of intention not contained herein.

 



 

 _10.8._ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for: (a) following the
Effective Time, the right of holders of Shares to receive the aggregate
consideration payable pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement, (b) the right
of the Company on behalf of holders of Shares to recover damages (which
damages shall be determined based on the loss of the economic benefits of the
Transactions to the holders of Shares) in the event of Parents or Merger
Subs breach of this Agreement (whether or not the Agreement has been
terminated), which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and
Merger Sub and (c) the right of the Indemnified Parties to enforce the
provisions of Section 7.10 ( _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers
Insurance_), Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies
hereunder, including without limitation, the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The third-party beneficiary
rights referenced in clause (b) of the preceding sentence may be exercised
only by the Company (on behalf of holders of Shares as their agent) through
actions approved by the Company Board, and no stockholder of the Company
whether purporting to act in its capacity as a holder of Shares or purporting
to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company,
shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise of any such
right.

 



      
 

 



 

 _10.9._ _Obligations of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action. Parent and Merger Sub shall be jointly and severally liable for
the failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective
covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder.

 



 

 _10.10._ _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex B are defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 



 

 _10.11._ _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

 _10.12._ _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to an Article, or Section of, or Annex or Exhibit to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The terms " _include_ ," " _includes_ "
or " _including_ " are not intended to be limiting and shall be deemed to be
followed by the words " _without limitation_ " or words of like import. The
use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, or the singular or plural
form of words used herein (including defined terms) shall not limit any
provision of this Agreement. Reference herein to a particular Person includes
such Persons successors and assigns to the extent such successors and assigns
are permitted by the terms of any applicable contract. Reference to a
particular contract (including this Agreement), document or instrument means
such contract, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Reference herein to "
_made available_ " (or words of similar import) in respect of information made
available (or words of similar import) by the Company mean any information
made available to Parent (including any information made available prior to
the date hereof in the virtual data room maintained by the Company). Any
reference to a particular Law means such Law as amended, modified or
supplemented (including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and,
unless otherwise provided, as in effect from time to time. The terms " _cash_
," " _dollars_ " and " _$_ " mean United States Dollars. The use of the terms
" _hereunder_ ," " _hereof_ ," " _hereto_ " and

 



      
 

 



 

words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular Article, Section, paragraph or clause of, or Annex or Exhibit
to, this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The parties have jointly participated in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
disclosure letter (each, a " ** _Disclosure Letter_** ") in a section thereof
that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The
mere inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of any partys
Disclosure Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty or
otherwise, shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the applicable
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item has, had, or is reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the purposes of this
Agreement, or that such item meets or exceeds a monetary or other threshold
specified for disclosure in this Agreement. Matters disclosed in any section
or subsection of a partys Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to
matters that are required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only, and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or
obligation to disclose any information beyond what is required by this
Agreement, and disclosure of such additional matters shall not affect,
directly or indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of
the disclosure obligations hereunder. Headings inserted in the sections or
subsections of any partys Disclosure Letter are for convenience of reference
only, and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the express terms
of the sections or subsections as set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 _10.13_ _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be
null and void.

 



       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.

writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this
Agreement and (subject to Section 4.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and
Parent, if made in the manner provided in this Section 1.5. Parent may set a
record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders entitled to
vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under
this Agreement, which date shall be, and shall be announced, no greater than
sixty (60) and no less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such vote or
consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this
Agreement. If not previously set by Parent, (i) the record date for
determining the Holders entitled to vote at a meeting of the Holders shall be
the date preceding the date notice of such meeting is mailed to

 



      
 

 



 

the Holders, or if notice is not given, on the day next preceding the day such
meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining the Holders entitled
to consent to any action in writing without a meeting shall be the first date
on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed
to be taken is delivered to Parent. If a record date is fixed, those Persons
who were Holders of Securities at such record date (or their duly designated
proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to take such action by
vote or consent or, except with respect to clause (d) below, to revoke any
vote or consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be
Holders after such record date. No such vote or consent shall be valid or
effective for more than one hundred twenty (120) days after such record date.

 



 

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or
writing may be proved in any reasonable manner which the Trustee deems
sufficient.

 



 

(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
Neither Parent nor the Trustee nor any agent of Parent or the Trustee shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

 



 

(d) At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as
provided in this Section 1.5, of the taking of any action by the Holders of
the Securities specified in this Agreement in connection with such action, any
Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be
included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have
consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust
Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Section 1.5, revoke such
action so far as concerns such Security. Any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any
Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security or the Holder of
every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange
therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, suffered or omitted
to be done by the Trustee, any Paying Agent or Parent in reliance thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Notices, etc., to Trustee and Company_. Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other
document provided or permitted by this Agreement to be made upon, given or
furnished to, or filed with:

 



 

(a) the Trustee by any Holder or by Parent shall be sufficient for every
purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed, in writing, to or with
the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office; or

 



 

(b) Parent by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every
purpose hereunder if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
Parent addressed to it at 65 Hayden Avenue, Lexington Massachusetts 02421,
Attn: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Legal Officer, or at any other address
previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by Parent, with a copy to Ropes
and Gray LLP addressed to it at Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston
Massachusetts 02199, Attn: Paul M. Kinsella.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 1.7 _Notice to Holders; Waiver_. Where this Agreement provides for
notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given
(unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-
class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at such Holders
address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest
date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of
such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the
failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any
particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to
other Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such
notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of
such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action
taken in reliance upon such waiver.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Conflict with Trust Indenture Act_. If any provision hereof
limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required
to be included in this Agreement by any of the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act, such required provision shall control.

 



 

Section 1.9 _Effect of Headings and Table of Contents_. The Article and
Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction hereof.

 



 

Section 1.10 _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement or in the
Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person (other than the
Parties hereto and their successors hereunder, any Paying Agent and the
Holders) any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
this Agreement or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such
covenants and provisions being for sole benefit of the Parties hereto and
their successors, any Paying Agent and of the Holders.

 



 

Section 1.11 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD
TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. EACH OF PARENT, THE TRUSTEE AND
EACH OF THE HOLDERS BY THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE SECURITIES, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY DELAWARE STATE COURT OR ANY
FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SECURITIES,
AND IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY, JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH OF PARENT AND
THE TRUSTEE AGREES THAT PROCESS MAY BE SERVED UPON THEM IN ANY MANNER
AUTHORIZED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR SUCH PERSONS AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY EFFECTIVELY DO SO UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO SUCH SERVICE OF
PROCESS, THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.12 _Legal Holidays_. In the event that any CVR Payment Date shall
not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
or the Securities to the contrary) payment on the Securities need not be made
on such date, but may be made, without the accrual of any additional interest
thereon on account of such CVR Payment Date not being a Business Day, on the
next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
CVR Payment Date.

 



 

Section 1.13 _Reparability Clause_. In the event any provision in this
Agreement or in the CVRs shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 



 

Section 1.14 _No Recourse Against Others_. A director, officer or employee, as
such, of Parent or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any
obligations of Parent or the Trustee under the Securities or this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or
their creation. By accepting a Security each Holder waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the
issue of the Securities.

 



 

Section 1.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement shall be signed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be
deemed an original of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.16 _Acceptance of Trust_. [*], the Trustee named herein, hereby
accepts the trusts in this Agreement declared and provided, upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

THE SECURITIES_

 



 

Section 3.1 _Title and Terms_.

 



 

(a) The aggregate number of CVRs which may be authenticated, as applicable,
and delivered under this Agreement is limited to a number equal to [*], except
for Securities authenticated, as applicable, and delivered upon registration
of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Securities pursuant
to Section 3.4, 3.5 or 6.6. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
not be permitted to issue any CVRs that have the right to receive any portion
of a CVR Payment, except as provided and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Securities shall be known and designated as the "Series A Contingent
Value Rights" of Parent.

 



 

(c) On or before the fifth Business Day following the earlier of (i) the date
on which any Net Sales Statement filed with the Trustee pursuant to Section
5.4(b) reflects that the Third Net Sales Milestone has been achieved and (ii)
the Net Sales Milestone Payment Termination Date, Parent will deliver to the
Trustee a notice (the " _Milestone Notice_ ") indicating, in the case of the
preceding clause (i) that the Third Net Sales Milestone was achieved and in
the case of the preceding clause (ii), whether any Net Sales Milestone was
achieved. If the Milestone Notice has indicated any Net Sales Milestone was
achieved, no future Milestone Notices will be delivered. The Trustee will,
within ten Business Days of receipt of the Milestone Notice, send each Holder
as of the close of business on the date of the Milestone Notice at its
registered address as reflected in the Security Register a copy of the
Milestone Notice. If any Net Sales Milestone has been achieved, then at the
time the Trustee sends the copy of the Milestone Notice to the Holders, the
Trustee will also pay to each Holder an amount equal to (x) $3.00, if the
First Net Sales Milestone is achieved during the Measurement Period and
neither the Second Net Sales Milestone nor the Third Net Sales Milestone is
achieved during the Measurement Period, $4.00, if the Second Net Sales
Milestone is achieved during the Measurement Period and the Third Net Sales
Milestone is not achieved during the Measurement Period, or $5.00, if Third
Net Sales Milestone is achieved during the Measurement Period, multiplied by
(y) the number of CVRs held by such Holder (the "Net Sales Milestone Payment")
by check mailed to the address of each Holder as of the close of business on
the date of the Milestone Notice (the " _Net Sales Milestone Payment Date_ ").

 



 

(d) The Holders of the CVRs, by acceptance thereof, agree that no joint
venture, partnership or other fiduciary relationship is created hereby or by
the Securities.

 



 

(e) Other than in the case of interest on amounts due and payable after the
occurrence of an Event of Default or with respect to any CVR Payment due
pursuant to Section 7.6(b) or Article 10, no interest or dividends shall
accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The CVRs and any interest thereon may be sold, assigned, pledged
encumbered or in any manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part,
only in compliance with applicable United States federal and state securities
Laws and, to the extent applicable, in accordance with Section 3.4 hereof.

 



 

(g) The Holder of any CVR is not, and shall not, by virtue thereof, be
entitled to any rights of a holder of any Voting Securities or other equity
security or other ownership interest of Parent or in any constituent company
to the Merger, either at Law or in equity, and the rights of the Holders are
limited to those contractual rights expressed in this Agreement.

 



 

(h) Except as provided in this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Section 7.6), none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall have any right to
set-off any amounts owed or claimed to be owed by any Holder to any of them
against such Holders Securities or any CVR Payment or other amount payable to
such Holder in respect of such Securities.

 



 

(i) In the event that all of the CVRs not previously cancelled shall have
become due and payable pursuant to the terms hereof, all disputes with respect
to amounts payable to the Holders brought pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement have been resolved, and Parent has paid or caused to be paid
or deposited with the Trustee all amounts payable to the Holders under this
Agreement (including any amounts determined in accordance with Section 7.6
herein), then this Agreement shall cease to be of further effect and shall be
deemed satisfied and discharged. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and
discharge of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent under Section 4.7(c)
shall survive.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Registrable Form_. The Securities shall be issuable only in
registered form. The CVRs shall be issued initially in the form of (a) one or
more permanent Global Securities, deposited with the Trustee, as the custodian
for The Depository Trust Company, its nominees and successors (the "
_Depositary_ "), or (b) one or more Direct Registration Securities. Each
Global Security will represent such of the Outstanding CVRs as will be
specified therein and each shall provide that it represents the aggregate
number of Outstanding CVRs from time to time endorsed thereon and that the
aggregate number of Outstanding CVRs represented thereby may from time to time
be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating_.

 



 

(a) The Global Securities shall be executed on behalf of Parent by its
chairman of the Board of Directors or any other Person duly authorized to act
on behalf of Parent for such purpose, but need not be attested. The signature
of any of these officers on the Global Securities may be manual or facsimile.

 



 

(b) Global Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
individuals who were, at the time of execution, the proper officers of Parent
shall bind Parent, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have
ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such
Global Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Global
Securities.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent may deliver a Parent Order for the authentication, as
applicable, and delivery of Securities, and the Trustee, in accordance with
such Parent Order, shall authenticate, as applicable, and deliver such
Securities as provided in this Agreement and not otherwise. In the case of
Global Securities, such Parent Order shall be accompanied by Global Securities
executed by Parent and delivered to the Trustee for authentication in
accordance with such Parent Order.

 



 

(d) Each Global Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

 



 

(e) No Global Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement
or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such
Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided
for herein duly executed by the Trustee, by manual or facsimile signature of
an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be
conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Global Security has been
duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Direct Registration Securities need not be authenticated, and shall be
valid and obligatory for all purposes and shall entitle each Holder thereof to
all benefits of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause to be kept at the office of the Trustee a register (the
register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency
designated pursuant to Section 7.2 being herein sometimes referred to as the "
_Security Register_ ") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe, Parent shall provide for the registration of Securities and of
transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed " _Security
Registrar_ " for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of
Securities as herein provided.

 



 

(b) (i) A Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the
Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to
the Depositary or to another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary
or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor
Depositary. All Global Securities will be exchanged by Parent for Direct
Registration Securities if (1) Parent delivers to the Security Registrar
notice from the Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act
as Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing agency registered under the
Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not appointed by
Parent within 120 days after the date of such notice from the Depositary; (2)
Parent in its sole discretion determines that the Global Securities (in whole
but not in part) should be exchanged for Direct Registration Securities and
delivers a written notice to such effect to the Security Registrar or (3) an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Security Registrar has
received a request from the Depositary to issue Direct Registration
Securities. Upon the occurrence of either of the preceding events in (1) or
(2) above, Direct Registration Securities shall be issued in such names as the
Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. Global Securities also may be exchanged
or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in this Section 3.4 and Section
3.5 hereof. Every Global Security authenticated and delivered in exchange for,
or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, pursuant to this
Section 3.4

 



      
 

 



 

or Section 3.5 hereof, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of,
and shall be, a Global Security. A Global Security may not be exchanged for
another Global Security other than as provided in this Section 3.4(b)(i),
however, beneficial interests in a Global Security may be transferred and
exchanged as provided in Section 3.4(b)(ii) or (iii) hereof.

 



 

(ii) The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global
Securities will be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Applicable Procedures. Beneficial
interests in any Global Security may be transferred to Persons who take
delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in Global Security. No
written orders or instructions shall be required to be delivered to the
Security Registrar to effect the transfers described in this Section
3.4(b)(ii).

 



 

(iii) If any holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security proposes to
exchange such beneficial interest for a Direct Registration Security or to
transfer such beneficial interest to a Person who takes delivery thereof in
the form of a Direct Registration Security, then the Security Registrar will
cause the aggregate number of CVRs represented by the applicable Global
Security to be reduced accordingly pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(vi) hereof, and
the Security Registrar will deliver to the Person designated in the
instructions a Direct Registration Security in the appropriate number of CVRs.
Any Direct Registration Security issued in exchange for a beneficial interest
pursuant to this Section 3.4(b)(iii) will be registered in such name or names
and in such authorized denomination or denominations as the holder of such
beneficial interest requests through instructions to the Security Registrar
from or through the Depositary and the Participant or Indirect Participant.

 



 

(iv) A Holder of a Direct Registration Security may exchange such Direct
Registration Security for a beneficial interest in a Global Security or
transfer such Direct Registration Security to a Person who takes delivery
thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Global Security at any time.
Upon receipt of a request for such an exchange or transfer, the Security
Registrar will cancel the applicable Direct Registration Security and increase
or cause to be increased the aggregate number of CVRs represented by one of
the Global Securities.

 



 

(v) Upon request by a Holder of Direct Registration Securities and such
Holders compliance with the provisions of this Section 3.4(b)(v), the
Security Registrar will register the transfer or exchange of Direct
Registration Securities. Prior to such registration of transfer or exchange,
the requesting Holder must present to the Security Registrar a written
instruction of transfer in form satisfactory to the Security Registrar duly
executed by such Holder or by its attorney, duly authorized in writing. A
Holder of Direct Registration Securities may transfer such Direct Registration
Securities to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of Direct
Registration Securities. Upon receipt of a request to register such a
transfer, the Security Registrar shall register the Direct Registration
Securities pursuant to the instructions from the Holder thereof.

 



 

(vi) At such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Security
have been exchanged for Direct Registration Securities or a particular Global
Security has been repurchased or canceled in whole and not in part, each such
Global Security will be returned to or retained and canceled by the Security
Registrar in accordance with Section 3.8

 



      
 

 



 

hereof. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in
a Global Security is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take
delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global
Security or for Direct Registration Securities, the aggregate number of CVRs
represented by such Global Security will be reduced accordingly and an
endorsement will be made on such Global Security by the Security Registrar or
by the Depositary at the direction of the Security Registrar to reflect such
reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or
transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a
beneficial interest in another Global Security, such other Global Security
will be increased accordingly and an endorsement will be made on such Global
Security by the Security Registrar or by the Depositary at the direction of
the Security Registrar to reflect such increase.

 



 

(vii) (A) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, Parent will
execute, and the Trustee will authenticate Global Securities upon receipt of a
Parent Order in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof or at the Security
Registrars request.

 



 

(B) No service charge will be made to a Holder of a beneficial interest in a
Global Security or to a Holder of a Direct Registration Security for any
registration of transfer or exchange, but Parent may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in
connection therewith, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 6.6.

 



 

(C) All Global Securities and Direct Registration Securities issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Global Securities or Direct
Registration Securities will be the valid obligations of Parent, evidencing
the same rights, and entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement, as
the Global Securities or Direct Registration Securities surrendered upon such
registration of transfer or exchange.

 



 

(D) The Trustee will authenticate Global Securities in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.3 hereof.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities_.

 



 

(a) If (i) any mutilated Global Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or
(ii) Parent and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Global Security, and there is delivered to
Parent and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to Parent or the
Trustee that such Global Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,
Parent shall execute and, upon delivery of a Parent Order, the Trustee shall
authenticate, as applicable, and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated
Global Security or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Global
Security, a new CVR, in the form of either a Global Security or a Direct
Registration Security, of like tenor and amount of CVRs, bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding.

 



 

(b) In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Global Security has
become or is to become finally due and payable within fifteen (15) days,
Parent in its discretion

 



      
 

 



 

may, instead of issuing a new CVR, pay to the Holder of such Security on the
applicable CVR Payment Date, as the case may be, all amounts due and payable
with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 3.5 in lieu of any
destroyed, lost or stolen Global Security shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of Parent, whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen Global Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
shall be entitled to all benefits of this Agreement equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 3.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Global
Securities.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Payments with Respect to CVRs_. Payment of any amounts pursuant
to the CVRs shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time is legal tender for the payment of public and private
debts. Parent may, at its option, pay such amounts by wire transfer or check
payable in such money.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Persons Deemed Owners_. Prior to the time of due presentment for
registration of transfer, Parent, the Trustee and any agent of Parent or the
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the
owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment on such Security
and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be
overdue, and neither Parent, the Trustee nor any agent of Parent or the
Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Cancellation_. All Securities surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other
than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly canceled
by it. Parent may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any
Global Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which
Parent may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Global Securities
so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as
provided in this Section 3.8, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.
All cancelled Global Securities held by the Trustee shall be destroyed and a
certificate of destruction shall be issued by the Trustee to Parent, unless
otherwise directed by a Parent Order.

 



 

Section 3.9 _CUSIP Numbers_. Parent in issuing the CVRs may use "CUSIP"
numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP"
numbers in notices to the Holders as a convenience to the Holders; _provided_
that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the CVRs or as contained in
any notices and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification
numbers printed on the CVRs, and any such notice shall not be affected by any
defect in or omission of such numbers. Parent will promptly notify the Trustee
of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4** _ 
THE TRUSTEE_

 



 

Section 4.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_.

 



 

(a) With respect to the Holders, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default (as defined in Section 8.1) with respect to the Securities
and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have
occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants shall be
read into this Agreement against the Trustee. In case an Event of Default with
respect to the Securities has occurred (which has not been cured or waived),
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs.

 



 

(b) In the absence of bad faith on its part, prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default
which may have occurred, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of
the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon
certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee which conform to the
requirements of this Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or
opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be
furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the
same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Trustee
from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act
or its own willful misconduct, except that (i) this Subsection (c) shall not
be construed to limit the effect of Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section
4.1; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in
good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the
Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and (iii) the
Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders
pursuant to Section 8.9 relating to the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any
trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this
Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
4.1.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Certain Rights of Trustee_. Subject to the provisions of Section
4.1, including without limitation, the duty of care that the Trustee is
required to exercise upon the occurrence of an Event of Default:

 



 

(a) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from
acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note,
other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document reasonably believed
by it to be genuine and to have been

 



      
 

 



 

signed or presented by the proper party or parties and the Trustee need not
investigate any fact or matter stated in the document;

and the Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take
in good faith reliance thereon;

 



 

(c) whenever in the administration of this Agreement the Trustee shall deem it

omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein

counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

 



 

(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers vested in it by this Agreement at the request or direction of any of
the Holders pursuant to this Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered
to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses
and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request
or direction;

 



 

(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or
matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, appraisal, bond, debenture,
note, coupon, security, or other paper or document, but the Trustee in its
discretion may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or
matters as it may see fit, and if the Trustee shall determine to make such
further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books,
records and premises of Parent, personally or by agent or attorney;

 



 

(g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform
any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and
the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the

(j) in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special,
indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including,
but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the
form of action;

 



 

(k) certain of the Trustees duties hereunder may be performed by the Paying
Agent or Security Registrar;

 



 

(l) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any default or Event of
Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge
thereof or unless written notice thereof has been received by such Responsible

this Agreement and the fact that such notice constitutes notification of a
default;

 



 

(m) the Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of
the performance of its powers and duties hereunder;

 



 

(n) the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated in this Agreement shall

civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of
God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities or communications
services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts
which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume
performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Notice of Default_. If a default occurs hereunder with respect to
the Securities, the Trustee shall give the Holders notice of any such default
actually known to it as and to the extent applicable and provided by the Trust
Indenture Act; _provided, however_ , that in the case of any default of the
character specified in Section 8.1(b) with respect to the Securities, no
notice to Holders shall be given until at least thirty (30) days after the
occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section 4.3, the term "default"
means any event that is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would
become, an Event of Default with respect to the Securities.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities_. The
Trustee shall not be accountable for Parents use of the Securities or the
proceeds from the Securities. The Recitals contained herein and in the
Securities, except the Trustees certificates of authentication, shall be
taken as the statements of Parent, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility
for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity
or sufficiency of this Agreement or of the Securities.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 4.5 _May Hold Securities_. The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Security
Registrar or any other agent of Parent, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities, and, subject to

Section 4.7 _Compensation and Reimbursement_. Parent agrees:

 



 

(a) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all
services rendered by it hereunder in such amount as Parent and the Trustee

provision of Law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust);

 



 

(b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee
upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this
Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses
and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense,
disbursement or advance as may be attributable to the Trustees bad faith,
negligence or willful misconduct; and

 



 

(c) to indemnify the Trustee and each of its agents, officers, directors and
employees (each an "indemnitee") for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred
without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of this trust and the performance of its
duties hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending
itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or
performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. Parents payment
obligations pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of an Event
of Default specified in Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(d) with respect to Parent, the
expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under
bankruptcy Laws.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Disqualification; Conflicting Interests_.

 



 

(a) If applicable, to the extent that the Trustee or Parent determines that
the Trustee has a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust
Indenture Act, the Trustee shall, within ninety (90) days after ascertaining
that it has such conflicting interest, either eliminate such conflicting
interest or resign to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to
the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Agreement. Parent shall
take prompt steps to have a successor appointed in the manner provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event the Trustee shall fail to comply with the foregoing
Subsection 4.8(a), the Trustee shall, within ten (10) days of the expiration
of such ninety (90)

 



      
 

 



 

day period, transmit a notice of such failure to the Holders in the manner and
to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act and this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 4.8(a) after written request
therefore by Parent or any Holder, any Holder of any Security who has been a
bona fide Holder for at least six (6) months may on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the removal of such Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility_. There shall at all
times be a Trustee hereunder which satisfies the applicable requirements of
Sections 310(a)(1) and (5) of the Trust Indenture Act and has a combined
capital and surplus of at least one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). If
such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to
Law or to the requirements of a supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section 4.9, the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set
forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the
Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article 4.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

 



 

(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor
Trustee pursuant to this Article 4 shall become effective until the acceptance
of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 4.11.

 



 

(b) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may resign at
any time by giving written notice thereof to Parent. If an instrument of
acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee
within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

 



 

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time by an Act of the Acting Holders,
delivered to the Trustee and to Parent.

 



 

(d) If at any time:

 



 

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 4.8 after written request
therefor by Parent or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security for at least six months, or

 



 

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 4.9 and shall fail to
resign after written request therefor by Parent or by any such Holder, or

 



 

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall
be

 



      
 

 



 

appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee
or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation
or liquidation,

 



 

then, in any case, (i) Parent, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee,
or (ii) the Holder of any Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others
similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

 



 

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or
if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, Parent, by a
Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. If, within one
year after any removal by Holders of a majority of the Outstanding Securities,
a successor Trustee shall be appointed by act of the Holders of a majority of
the Outstanding Securities delivered to Parent and the retiring Trustee the
successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such
appointment in accordance with Section 4.11, become the successor Trustee and
supersede the successor Trustee appointed by Parent. If no successor Trustee
shall have been so appointed by Parent or the Holders of the Securities and
accepted appointment within sixty (60) days after the retiring Trustee tenders
its resignation or is removed, the retiring Trustee may, or, the Holder of any
Security who has been a bona fide Holder for at least six (6) months may on
behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

 



 

(f) Parent shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the
Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee by mailing written notice
of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of
Securities as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Each
notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee and the address of its
Corporate Trust Office. If Parent fails to send such notice within ten (10)
days after acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee, it shall not be a
default hereunder but the successor Trustee shall cause the notice to be
mailed at the expense of Parent.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Acceptance of Appointment of Successor_.

 



 

(a) Every successor Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to Parent and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee
shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, upon request of Parent or the
successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all
the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign,
transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by
such retiring Trustee hereunder. Upon request of any such successor Trustee,
Parent shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly
vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers
and trusts.

 



 

(b) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of
such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article 4.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.12 _Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business_.
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, by sale or otherwise shall be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and
eligible under this Article 4, without the execution or filing of any paper or
any further act on the part of any of the Parties hereto. In case any
Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee
then in office, any successor by merger, conversion, sale or consolidation to
such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the
Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee
had itself authenticated such Securities; and such certificate shall have the
full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Agreement
_provided_ that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; _provided_ that the
right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee
shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or
consolidation.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company_. If and when
the Trustee shall be or shall become a creditor, directly or indirectly,
secured or unsecured, of Parent (or any other obligor upon the Securities),
excluding any creditor relationship set forth in Section 311(b) of the Trust
Indenture Act, if applicable, the Trustee shall be subject to the applicable
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims
against Parent (or any such other obligor).

practicable, the names and addresses of Holders contained in the most recent

Trust Indenture Act, if applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with
Parent and the Trustee that neither Parent nor the Trustee shall be deemed to

such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders made pursuant to
the Trust Indenture Act (if applicable) regardless of the source from which
such information was derived.

any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision, such
amendment may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which

Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event
of Default or may limit the right of the Acting Holders to waive such an Event
of Default; or

 



 

(iv) to cure any ambiguity, or to correct or supplement any provision herein
or in the Securities which may be defective or inconsistent with any other

the interests of the Holders; or

Section 6.2 _Amendments with Consent of Holders_. With the consent of the
Majority Holders, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company or the
Trustee, Parent (when authorized by a Board Resolution), at any time and from
time to time, may enter into one or more amendments hereto or to the

need not, execute such amendment.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Effect of Amendments; Notice to Holders_.

 **ARTICLE 7** _ 
COVENANTS_

 



 

Section 7.1 _Payment of Amounts, if any, to Holders_. Parent will duly and
punctually pay the amounts, if any, on the Securities in accordance with the
terms of the Securities and this Agreement. Such amounts shall be considered
paid on the applicable CVR Payment Date if on such date the Trustee or the
Paying Agent holds in accordance with this Agreement money sufficient to pay
all such amounts then due. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable), the Trustee or the Paying Agent, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from
amounts (including CVRs) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such
amounts as Parent or any of its Affiliates, the Trustee or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue

 



      
 

 



 

Code of 1986, as amended, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or any of its Affiliates,
the Trustee or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law and
(b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
or any of its Affiliates, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.
The consent of Holder shall not be required for any such withholding.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Maintenance of Office or Agency_.

 



 

(a) As long as any of the Securities remain Outstanding, Parent will maintain
in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, an office or agency (i)
where Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, (ii) where
Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and
(iii) where notices and demands to or upon Parent in respect of the Securities
and this Agreement may be served. The office or agency of the Trustee at [*]
shall be such office or agency of Parent, unless Parent shall designate and
maintain some other office or agency for one or more of such purposes. Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, registrar or transfer
agent; _provided_ that such Person shall take appropriate actions to avoid the
commingling of funds. Parent will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
any change in the location of any such office or agency. If at any time Parent
shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and Parent hereby appoints the Trustee
as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and
demands.

 



 

(b) Parent may from time to time designate one or more other offices or
agencies (in or outside of the City of New York) where the Securities may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes, and may from time to
time rescind such designation; _provided, however_ , that no such designation
or rescission shall in any manner relieve Parent of its obligation to maintain
an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York for such
purposes. Parent will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such
designation or rescission and any change in the location of any such office or
agency.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust_.

 



 

(a) If Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall at any time act as the Paying
Agent, it will, on or before a CVR Payment Date, as the case may be, segregate
and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders all sums held by such Paying
Agent for payment on the Securities until such sums shall be paid to the
Holders as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of any
default by Parent in making payment on the Securities.

 



 

(b) Whenever Parent shall have one or more Paying Agents for the Securities,
it will, on or before a CVR Payment Date deposit with a Paying Agent a sum in
same day funds sufficient to pay the amount, if any, so becoming due; such sum
to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such amount,
and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) Parent will promptly notify the
Trustee of such action or any failure so to act.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Parent will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and
deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree
with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 7.3, that (i) such
Paying Agent will hold all sums held by it for the payment of any amount
payable on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as
herein provided and will notify the Trustee of the sums so held and (ii) that
it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by Parent (or by any other
obligor on the Securities) to make any payment on the Securities when the same
shall be due and payable.

 



 

(d) Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
Parent, in trust for the payment on any Security and remaining unclaimed for
one (1) year after a CVR Payment Date shall be paid to Parent on Parent
Request, or (if then held by Parent) shall be discharged from such trust; and
the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general
creditor, look only to Parent for payment thereof, and all liability of the
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money shall thereupon
cease.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Certain Purchases and Sales_. Nothing contained herein shall
prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from acquiring in
open market transactions, private transactions or otherwise, the Securities;
_provided_ that prior to any acquisition of any Securities, Parent must
publicly disclose the amount of Securities which it has been authorized to
acquire as well as the amount of Securities it has acquired as of the end of
the quarterly or annual period reported in such quarterly or annual report
pursuant to Section 5.4.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Books and Records_. Parent shall keep, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to keep, true, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail
to enable the amounts payable under this Agreement to be determined by the
Holders and their consultants or professional advisors, for a period of three
(3) years following the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Audits_.

 



 

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders within one year of the date
of the Milestone Notice (the " _Review Request Period_ "), Parent shall
permit, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to permit, the Independent
Accountant to have access during normal business hours to such of the records
of the Company as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the
Net Sales Statements and the figures underlying the calculations set forth
therein, including, without limitation, all written materials related to any
sale transaction reasonably requested by such Independent Accountant. The
Independent Accountant shall be charged to come to a final determination with
respect to those specific items in the Net Sales Statements that the parties
disagree on and submit to it for resolution. All other items in the Net Sales
Statements that the parties do not submit, prior to the end of the Review
Request Period, to the Independent Accountant for resolution shall be deemed
to be agreed by the parties and the Independent Accountant shall not be
charged with calculating or validating those agreed upon items. If issues are
submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution, Parent shall, and
shall cause to its controlled Affiliates to, furnish to the Independent
Accountant such access, work papers and other documents and information
related to those disputed issues as the Independent Accountant may request and
as are available to Parent. The Independent Accountant shall disclose to
Parent and the Acting Holders any matters directly related to their

 



      
 

 



 

findings to the extent necessary to verify the accuracy or completeness of the
Net Sales Statements. The fees charged by such accounting firm shall be paid
by Parent.

 



 

(b) If the Independent Accountant concludes that the Net Sales Milestone
Payment was properly due but was not paid to the Holders, Parent shall pay the
Net Sales Milestone Payment within ten (10) days of the date the Acting
Holders deliver to Parent the Independent Accountants written report (the "
_Shortfall Report_ "); _provided_ that the Net Sales Milestone Payment amount
shall bear interest at the Default Interest Rate beginning from the date the
Net Sales Milestone Payment should have been duly and punctually made had the
Net Sales Milestone Payment been made in accordance with the Shortfall Report,
and running until payment is made to the Trustee. The decision of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and
the Holders, shall be non-appealable and shall not be subject to further
review.

 



 

(c) If, upon the expiration of the Review Request Period, the Acting Holders
have not requested a review of the Net Sales Statements in accordance with
this Section 7.6, the calculations set forth in the Net Sales Statements shall
be binding and conclusive upon the Holders.

 



 

(d) Each Person seeking to receive information from Parent in connection with
a review pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall enter into, and shall cause its
accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory
confidentiality agreement with Parent or any controlled Affiliate obligating
such party to retain all such information disclosed to such party in
confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

 



 

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any
license or distribution agreement with any third party (other than Parent or
its Affiliates) with respect to the Product unless such agreement contains
provisions that would allow any Independent Accountant appointed pursuant to
this Section 7.6 such access to the records of the other party to such license
or distribution agreement as may be reasonably necessary to perform its duties
pursuant to this Section 7.6; _provided_ that Parent and its Affiliates shall
not be required to amend any Existing Licenses, but shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such other party to
such access. The Parties agree that, if Parent or its Affiliates have
exercised audit rights under any license or distribution agreement prior to
the Acting Holders request for an audit under this Section 7.6 and under such
license or distribution agreement Parent and its Affiliates cannot request
another audit, the results of Parents prior audit of such licensee or
distributor will be used for purposes of the audit requested by the Acting
Holders under this Section 7.6 and that Parent shall not have any further
obligation to provide access to an Independent Accountant with respect to such
licensee until such time as Parent may again exercise its rights of audit
under the license agreement with such licensee.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Listing of CVRs_. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to cause the
Securities to be approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) for
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market and will maintain such listing for so long
as any CVRs remain Outstanding.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Product Transfer_. So long as the CVRs remain Outstanding, Parent
and its Affiliates may not, directly or indirectly, by a sale or swap of
assets, merger, reorganization, joint

 



      
 

 



 

venture, lease, license or any other transaction or arrangement, sell,
transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of their respective rights in and to the
Product to a third party (other than Parent or its Affiliates), unless at all
times after any such sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition, the
gross amounts invoiced for the Product by the applicable transferee will be
reflected in Net Sales in accordance with the terms hereunder (with the
transferee substituted for Parent for purposes of the definition of "Net
Sales") as if such transferee was Parent, and the contract for such sale,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition (which Parent shall take all
reasonable actions necessary to enforce in all material respects) shall
provide for such treatment and shall require the transferee to comply with the
covenants in this Section 7.8 and Sections 7.5, 7.9 and 7.10 hereof to the
same extent as Parent. For purposes of clarification, this Section 7.8 shall
not apply to sales of the Product made by Parent or its Affiliates or ordinary
course licensing arrangements between Parent and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and third party licensees, distributors and contract manufacturers, on
the other hand, entered into in the ordinary course of business for purposes
of developing, manufacturing, distributing and selling the Product and for
which the gross amounts invoiced for sales of the Product by the applicable
third party licensee, distributor or contract manufacturer will be reflected
in Net Sales of the Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Diligent Efforts_. Parent shall, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates and any other Selling Entity to, use Diligent Efforts to achieve
the Third Net Sales Milestone as promptly as practicable prior to the Net
Sales Milestone Payment Termination Date.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Notice of Default_. Parent shall file with the Trustee written
notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or other default under this
Agreement within five (5) business days of its becoming aware of any such
default or Event of Default. Parent shall deliver to the Trustee within 90
days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2013) an Officers Certificate stating whether or not to the best
knowledge of the signer thereof Parent is in default in the performance and
observance of any of the conditions or covenants under this Agreement (without
regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and
if Parent shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and
status thereof.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Confidentiality_. The Trustee and the Holders hereby agree that
any confidential or non-public information (including Net Sales Statements)
they receive from or on behalf of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, which
receipt arises out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Confidential Information_ "), shall: (a) not be used for any purpose other
than for purposes permitted under this Agreement; (b) not be used directly or
indirectly in any way that is for competitive purposes; and (c) not be
disclosed by, and be kept confidential by, such Trustee and the Holders and
its directors, officers, members, managers, employees, affiliates, and agents
(collectively, " _Representatives_ "); _provided, however_ , that any such
Confidential Information may be disclosed only to their Representatives
(including the Independent Accountant) who (i) need to know such Confidential
Information and (ii) are bound in writing to a non-disclosure agreement no
less restrictive than this Section 7.11. It is understood that such
Representatives shall be informed by the Trustee or the applicable Holder of
the confidential nature of such Confidential Information, and that the Trustee
or such Holder, as applicable, shall be responsible for any disclosure or use
made by its Representatives in

 



      
 

 



 

breach of obligations under this Agreement to the same extent as if such
disclosure or use had been made directly by the Trustee or such Holder, as
applicable. "Confidential Information" shall not include any information that
is (i) publicly available other than because of a breach of this Section 7.11
by the Trustee or the Holders or any of their respective Representatives or
(ii) is lawfully disclosed to the Trustee or Holders by sources (other than
Parent or its Affiliates) rightfully in possession of the Confidential
Information. If the Trustee, Holders or their respective Representatives are
legally required or requested to disclose any Confidential Information, they
will in advance of such disclosure, unless otherwise prohibited by Law,
promptly notify Parent of such request or requirement so that Parent may seek
to avoid or minimize the required disclosure and/or obtain an appropriate
protective order or other appropriate relief to ensure that any Confidential
Information so disclosed is maintained in confidence to the maximum extent
possible by the Person receiving the disclosure, or, in Parents discretion,
to waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In any such case,
the Trustee and the Holders agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid or minimize the required disclosure and/or obtain such
protective order or other relief. If, in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Trustee, Holders or their respective
Representatives are legally obligated to disclose any Confidential
Information, they will disclose only so much thereof to the party compelling
disclosure as they believe in good faith, on the basis of advice of counsel,
is required by Law. The Trustee and Holders shall give Parent prior written
notice of the specific Confidential Information that they believe they are
required to disclose under such circumstances. All Confidential Information
disclosed by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be, and
shall remain, the property of Parent or such Affiliate.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Non-use of Name_. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders shall use
the name, trademark, trade name, or logo of Parent, its Affiliates, or their
respective employees in any publicity or news release relating to this
Agreement or its subject matter, without the prior express written permission
of Parent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8** _ 
REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND HOLDERS 
ON EVENT OF DEFAULT_

 



 

Section 8.1 _Event of Default Defined; Waiver of Default_. " _Event of
Default_ " with respect to the Securities, means each one of the following
events which shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for
such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be
effected by operation of Law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of
any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body):

 



 

(a) default in the payment of all or any part of any CVR Payment after a
period of ten (10) Business Days after such CVR Payment shall become due and
payable on a CVR Payment Date or otherwise; or

 



 

(b) material default in the performance, or breach in any material respect, of
any covenant or warranty of Parent in respect of the Securities (other than a
covenant or warranty in respect of the Securities, a default in whose
performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section 8.1 specifically
dealt with), and continuance of such default or

 



      
 

 



 

breach for a period of ninety (90) days after there has been given, by
registered or certified mail, to Parent by the Trustee or to Parent and the
Trustee by the Acting Holders, a written notice specifying such default or
breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "
_Notice of Default_ " hereunder; or

 



 

(c) a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order
for relief in respect of Parent in an involuntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, or
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or
sequestrator (or similar official) of Parent or for any substantial part of
its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and
such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of
ninety (90) consecutive days; or

 



 

(d) Parent shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the
entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such Law, or
consent to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator,
assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of Parent
or for any substantial part of its property, or make any general assignment
for the benefit of creditors.

 



 

If an Event of Default described above occurs and is continuing, then, and in
each and every such case, either the Trustee or the Trustee upon the written
request of the Acting Holders by notice in writing to Parent (and to the
Trustee if given by the Acting Holders), shall bring suit to protect the
rights of the Holders, including to obtain payment for any amounts then due
and payable, which amounts shall bear interest at the Default Interest Rate
until payment is made to the Trustee.

 



 

The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at
any time after the Trustee shall have begun such suit, and before any judgment
or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or
entered as hereinafter provided, Parent shall pay or shall deposit with the
Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all amounts which shall have become due (with
interest upon such overdue amount at the Default Interest Rate to the date of
such payment or deposit) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover
reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and
all other expenses and liabilities incurred and all advances made, by the
Trustee, and if any and all Events of Default under this Agreement shall have
been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein, then and in every
such case the Acting Holders, by written notice to Parent and to the Trustee,
may waive all defaults with respect to the Securities, but no such waiver or
rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent
default or shall impair any right consequent thereof.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Collection by the Trustee; the Trustee May Prove Payment
Obligations_. Parent covenants that in case default shall be made in the
payment of all or any part of the Securities when the same shall have become
due and payable, whether at a CVR Payment Date or otherwise, then upon demand
of the Trustee, Parent will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders
of the Securities the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable
on all Securities (with interest from the date due and payable to the date of
such payment upon the overdue amount at the Default Interest Rate); and in
addition thereto, such further amount as

 



      
 

 



 

shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including
reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses and liabilities
incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee,
except as a result of its negligence or bad faith.

 



 

The Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights
and the rights of the Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the
Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce
any other remedy.

 



 

In case Parent shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled
and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at Law or in equity for
the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such
action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such
judgment or final decree against Parent or other obligor upon such Securities
and collect in the manner provided by Law out of the property of Parent or
other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated, the moneys adjudged or
decreed to be payable.

 



 

In any judicial proceedings relative to Parent or other obligor upon the
Securities, irrespective of whether any amount is then due and payable with
respect to the Securities, the Trustee is authorized:

 



 

(a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount owing and unpaid
in respect of the Securities, and to file such other papers or documents as
may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee
(including any claim for reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and
for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances
made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as a result of
negligence or bad faith) and of the Holders allowed in any judicial
proceedings relative to Parent or other obligor upon the Securities, or to
their respective property;

 



 

(b) unless prohibited by and only to the extent required by applicable Law, to
vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee or a standby
trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceedings or Person performing similar functions in comparable
proceedings; and

 



 

(c) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable
on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the
claims of the Holders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee,
receiver, or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby
authorized by each of the Holders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the
event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the
Holders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover
reasonable compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and
liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee, except as a result of

 



      
 

 



 

its negligence or bad faith, and all other amounts due to the Trustee or any
predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 4.7. To the extent that such payment
of reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, advances and other
amounts out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any
reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid
out of, any and all distributions, dividends, moneys, securities and other
property which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceedings,
whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or
otherwise.

 



 

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize
or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Securities, or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee
to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding except,
as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar
person.

 



 

All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Agreement, or under
any of the Securities, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession
of any of the Securities or the production thereof and any trial or other
proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the
payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each
predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for
the ratable benefit of the Holders.

 



 

In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving
the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement to which the Trustee
shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders, and
it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Securities parties to
any such proceedings.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Application of Proceeds_. Any monies collected by the Trustee
pursuant to this Article 8 in respect of any Securities shall be applied in
the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee upon
presentation of the several Securities in respect of which monies have been
collected and stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the payment in exchange
for the presented Securities if only partially paid or upon surrender thereof
if fully paid:

 



 

FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses in respect of which monies have
been collected, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys and of all
expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and
each predecessor Trustee, except as a result of its bad faith, negligence or
willful misconduct, and all other amounts due to the Trustee or any
predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 4.7;

 



 

SECOND: To the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon all the
Securities, with interest at the Default Interest Rate on all such amounts,
and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount
so due and unpaid upon the Securities, then to the payment of such amounts
without preference or priority of any security over any other Security,
ratably to the aggregate of such amounts due and payable; and

 



      
 

 



 

THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to Parent or any other Person
lawfully entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Suits for Enforcement_. In case an Event of Default has occurred,
has not been waived and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion
proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Agreement by
such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual
to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at Law or in equity or in
bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the exercise of any
power granted in this Agreement or to enforce any other legal or equitable
right vested in the Trustee by this Agreement or by Law.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings_. In case the
Trustee or any Holder shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this
Agreement and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for
any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such
Holder, then and in every such case Parent and the Trustee and the Holders
shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder,
and all rights, remedies and powers of Parent, the Trustee and the Holders
shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Limitations on Suits by Holders_. Subject to the right of the
Acting Holders under Section 7.6, no Holder of any Security shall have any
right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Agreement to institute
any action or proceeding at Law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise
upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, or for the appointment of a
trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for any
other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the
Trustee written Notice of Default and of the continuance thereof, as
hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Acting Holders shall have made
written request upon the Trustee to institute such action or proceedings in
its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such
reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and the Trustee for fifteen (15)
days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall
have failed to institute any such action or proceeding and no direction
inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee
pursuant to Section 8.9. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions
of this Section 8.6, each and every Holder and the Trustee shall be entitled
to such relief as can be given either at Law or in equity.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Unconditional Right of Holders to Institute Certain Suits_.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and any provision of any
Security, the right of any Holder of any Security to receive payment of the
amounts payable in respect of such Security on or after the respective due
dates expressed in such Security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or
affected without the consent of such Holder.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.8 _Powers and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not Waiver of
Default_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 8.6, no right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive
of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any
other appropriate right or remedy.

 



 

(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right
or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as
aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject
to Section 8.6, every power and remedy given by this Agreement or by Law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often
as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Control by Holders_.

 



 

(a) The Acting Holders shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or
exercising any power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities
by this Agreement; _provided_ that such direction shall not be otherwise than
in accordance with Law and the provisions of this Agreement; and provided
further that (subject to the provisions of Section 4.1) the Trustee shall have
the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, being
advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed
may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of
directors, the executive committee or a committee of directors or responsible
officers of the Trustee shall determine that the action or proceedings so
directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if the Trustee in
good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or
pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of
Holders of the Securities not joining in the giving of said direction.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of the Trustee in its
discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not
inconsistent with such direction or directions by Holders.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Waiver of Past Defaults_.

 



 

(a) In the case of a default or an Event of Default specified in clause (b),
(c) or (d) of Section 8.1, the Acting Holders may waive any such default or
Event of Default, and its consequences except a default in respect of a
covenant or provisions hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the Holder of each Security affected. In the case of any such
waiver, Parent, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to
have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for
every purpose of this Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

 



 

Section 8.11 _The Trustee to Give Notice of Default, but May Withhold in
Certain Circumstances_. The Trustee shall transmit to the Holders, as the
names and addresses of such Holders appear on the Security Register (as
provided under Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable),
notice by mail of all defaults which have occurred and are known to the
Trustee, such notice to be transmitted within ninety (90) days after the
occurrence thereof, unless such defaults shall have been cured before the
giving of such notice (the term "default" for the purposes of this Section
8.11 being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with
notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); _provided_
that, except in the case of default in the payment of the amounts payable in
respect of any of the Securities, the Trustee shall be protected in
withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the
executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the
withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to Pay Costs_.
All Parties to this Agreement agree, and each Holder of any Security by his
acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Agreement or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it as the Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in
such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court
may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including attorneys fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and
good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the
provisions of this Section 8.12 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group of Holders holding in
the aggregate more than ten percent (10%) of the Securities Outstanding or to

 **ARTICLE 9** _ 
CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE OR CONVEYANCE_

 



 

Section 9.1 _Parent Successors and Assigns_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent may assign, in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Parent or to any purchaser or licensee of substantial rights
to the Product (each, an " _Assignee_ "). Any such Assignee may thereafter
assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more
additional Assignees; provided, however, that in connection with any
assignment to an Assignee, Parent and Merger Sub (or the other assignor) shall
remain liable for the performance by Parent and Merger Sub (and such other
assignor, if applicable) of their obligations hereunder. This Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Parents
successors and each Assignee, and this Agreement shall not restrict

 



      
 

 



 

Parents, any Assignees or any of their respective successors ability to
merge or consolidate. Each of Parents successors shall expressly assume by an
instrument supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, the due
and punctual payment of the CVRs and the due and punctual performance and
observance of all of the covenants and obligations of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by Parent.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Company May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms_. Parent
covenants that it will not merge or consolidate with or into any other Person
or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any Person,
unless, (i) Parent shall be the continuing Person, or the successor Person or
the Person which acquires by sale or conveyance substantially all the assets
of Parent (including the shares of Parent) shall be a Person organized under
the Laws of the United States of America or any State thereof and shall
expressly assume by an instrument supplemental hereto, executed and delivered
to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the due and punctual
payment of the Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual
performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this
Agreement to be performed or observed by Parent and (ii) Parent, or such
successor Person, as the case may be, shall not, immediately after such merger
or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, be in default in the performance
of any such covenant or condition.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Successor Person Substituted_.

 



 

(a) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and
following such an assumption by the successor Person, such successor Person
shall succeed to and be substituted for Parent with the same effect as if it
had been named herein. Such successor Person may cause to be signed, and may
issue either in its own name or in the name of Parent prior to such succession
any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder, in the case of Global
Securities, which theretofore shall not have been signed by Parent and
delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor corporation
instead of Parent and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in
this Agreement prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver
any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered to the
Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor
corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee
for that purpose. All of the Securities so issued shall in all respects have
the same legal rank and benefit under this Agreement as the Securities
theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the
execution hereof.

 



 

(b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, such
changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the
Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. The successor entity
to such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance may satisfy the obligations
of Section 5.4(a)(i) and (ii) of this Agreement by providing copies of such
successor entitys Exchange Act Documents in the case of Section 5.4(a)(i) or
such successor entitys financial information in the case of Section
5.4(a)(ii).

 



 

(c) In the event of any such sale, transfer or conveyance (other than a
conveyance by way of lease) Parent or any Person which shall theretofore have
become such in

 



      
 

 



 

the manner described in this Article 9 shall be discharged from all
obligations and covenants under this Agreement and the Securities and may be
liquidated and dissolved.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee_. The Trustee, subject to the
provisions of Sections 4.1 and 4.2, shall receive an Officers Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with Sections 1.3 and 1.4, as
conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance,
and any such assumption, and any such liquidation or dissolution, complies
with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, and if a supplemental
agreement is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental
agreement complies with this Article 9 and that there has been compliance with
all conditions precedent herein provided for or relating to such transaction.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Successors_. All covenants, provisions and agreements in this
Agreement by or for the benefit of Parent, the Trustee or the Holders shall
bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs
and personal representatives, whether so expressed or not. Parent may assign
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties to this
Agreement to one or more of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, _provided,
however_ , that in the event of any such assignment Parent shall remain
subject to its obligations and covenants hereunder, including but not limited
to its obligation to make the CVR Payments.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10**

 



 

 _PURCHASE OF SECURITIES UPON CVR FAILURE EVENT_

 



 

Section 10.1 _Notice of Trustee_. In the event that a Failure Purchase
Eligibility Date has occurred and Parent elects to purchase the Securities
pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.5 hereof (a " _Failure Purchase_ "),
it shall furnish to the Trustee, at least thirty (30) days (unless a shorter
period shall be agreed to by the Trustee) but not more than sixty (60) days
before the date on which Parent proposes to consummate the Failure Purchase
(any such date, a " _Failure Purchase Date_ ") (but in any event prior to the
notice provided pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof), an Officers Certificate (a
" _Failure Purchase Offer_ ") setting forth (i) the clause of this Agreement
pursuant to which the Failure Purchase shall occur, (ii) the Failure Purchase
Date, and (iii) the Failure Purchase Price, determined in accordance with
Section 10.5 hereof.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Notice of Failure Purchase_. At least thirty (30) days but not
more than sixty (60) days before a Failure Purchase Date, Parent shall mail or
cause to be mailed, a notice of Failure Purchase to each Holder at its
registered address (the " _Failure Purchase Notice_ ") and shall publicly
disclose the election of the Failure Purchase and the information required to
be contained in the Failure Purchase Notice pursuant to this Section 10.2. The
Failure Purchase Notice shall identify the number of Securities Outstanding
and shall state:

 



 

(a) the Failure Purchase Date;

 



 

(b) the Failure Purchase Price;

 



 

(c) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) that Securities must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the
Failure Purchase Price;

 



 

(e) that, unless Parent fails to make payment of the Failure Purchase Price,
all right, title and interest in and to the Securities and any CVR Payment or
any other amounts due under this Agreement, if any, on Securities called for
Failure Purchase ceases to accrue on and after the Failure Purchase Date;

 



 

(f) the clause of this Agreement pursuant to which the Failure Purchase shall
occur; and

 



 

(g) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the
CUSIP and ISIN number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the
Securities.

 



 

At Parents request, the Trustee shall give the Failure Purchase Notice in the
Parents name and at its expense; provided, however, that Parent shall have
delivered to the Trustee at least forty five (45) days (unless a shorter
period shall be agreed to by the Trustee) but not more than sixty (60) days
prior to the Failure Purchase Date, an Officers Certificate requesting that
the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in
such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Effect of Failure Purchase Notice_. Once the Failure Purchase
Notice is mailed in accordance with Section 10.2 hereof, the Securities shall
become irrevocably due and payable on the Failure Purchase Date at the Failure
Purchase Price. A Failure Purchase Notice shall be deemed to be given when
mailed, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. In any event, failure
to give a particular Holder his or her Failure Purchase Notice, or any defect
in such notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
Failure Purchase.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Deposit of Failure Purchase Price_. On or one (1) Business Day
prior to the Failure Purchase Date, Parent shall deposit with the Trustee or
with the Paying Agent (if different from the Trustee) money sufficient to pay
the Failure Purchase Price of all Securities Outstanding on that date. The
Trustee or the Paying Agent shall promptly return to Parent any money
deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by Parent in excess of the
amounts necessary to pay the Failure Purchase Price of all Securities
Outstanding.

 



 

If Parent complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and
after the Failure Purchase Date, all right, title and interest of a Holder to
any CVR Payment, if any, shall cease to accrue on the Securities. If any
Security called for Failure Purchase shall not be so paid upon surrender for
Failure Purchase because of the failure of Parent to comply with the preceding
paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid Failure Purchase Price from
the Failure Purchase Date, until such Failure Purchase Price is paid at the
Default Interest Rate.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Failure Purchase by Parent_. Parent may, for a period of thirty
(30) days after any Failure Purchase Eligibility Date, issue the Failure
Purchase Notice in accordance with Section 10.2. Upon issuance of the Failure
Purchase Notice and in compliance with the other provisions of this Article
10, Parent shall, on the Failure Purchase Date specified in such Failure
Purchase Notice, purchase and cancel all (but not less than all) of the
Outstanding Securities at a

 



      
 

 



 

cash price equal to 115% of the volume weighted average price paid per
Security for all Securities traded over the forty-five (45) trading days prior
to the fifth (5th) trading day prior to the date of the Failure Purchase
Notice (the " _Failure Purchase Price_ "). If Parent has not issued the
Failure Purchase Notice within such thirty (30) day period after the
occurrence of a Failure Purchase Eligibility Date, it shall not be entitled to
issue a Failure Purchase Notice and purchase and cancel the Securities until
the next instance in which a Failure Purchase Eligibility Date occurs.

Section 1. LAW, CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS

 



 

1.1. These by-laws are subject to the certificate of incorporation of the
corporation. In these by-laws, references to law, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws mean the law, the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and the by-laws as from time to time in effect.

 



 

Section 2. STOCKHOLDERS

 



 

2.1. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of
directors and the transaction of other business shall be held on such date and
at such place as may be designated by the board of directors. At each annual
meeting the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect a board of directors and
may transact such other proper business as may come before the meeting.

 



 

2.2. _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the stockholders may be called
at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the president or the board
of directors. A special meeting of the stockholders shall be called by the
secretary, or in the case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the
secretary, by an assistant secretary or some other officer, upon application
of a majority of the directors. Any such application shall state the purpose
or purposes of the proposed meeting. Any such call shall state the place,
date, hour and purposes of the meeting.

 



 

2.3. _Place of Meeting_. All meetings of the stockholders for the election of
directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such place within or
without the State of Delaware as may be determined from time to time by the
chairman of the board, if any, the president or the board of directors. Any
adjourned session of any meeting of the stockholders shall be held at the
place designated in the vote of adjournment.

 



 

2.4. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, a written
notice of each meeting of stockholders stating the place, day and hour thereof
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is
called, shall be given not less then one nor more than sixty days before the
meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, and to each stockholder
who, by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, is
entitled to notice, by leaving such notice with him or at his residence or
usual place of business, by depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, and addressed to such stockholder at his address as it appears in the
records of the corporation, or by sending it to him via email or facsimile at
his residence or usual place of business. Such notice shall be given by the
secretary, or by an officer or person designated by the board of directors, or
in the case of a special meeting

      
 

 



 

by the officer calling the meeting. As to any adjourned session of any meeting
of stockholders, notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was
taken except that if the adjournment is for more than thirty days or if after
the adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned session, notice of
any such adjourned session of the meeting shall be given in the manner
heretofore described. No notice of any meeting of stockholders or any
adjourned session thereof need be given to a stockholder if a written waiver
of notice, or a waiver by electronic transmissions by such stockholder,
executed before or after the meeting or such adjourned session by such
stockholder, is filed with the records of the meeting or if the stockholder
attends such meeting without objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
meeting of the stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be specified
in any written waiver of notice.

 



 

2.5. _Quorum of Stockholders_. At any meeting of the stockholders a quorum as
to any matter shall consist of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on
the matter, except where a larger quorum is required by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. Any meeting may be adjourned
from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question,
whether or not a quorum is present. If a quorum is present at an original
meeting, a quorum need not be present at an adjourned session of that meeting.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
any corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock,
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

 



 

2.6. _Action by Vote_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a plurality of
the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect to such office
and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any question other than an
election to an office shall decide the question, except when a larger vote is
required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. No
ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a stockholder
present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.

 



 

2.7. _Action without Meetings_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders
for or in connection with any corporate action may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing
or electronic transmission, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware by hand, electronic delivery, or certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, to its principal place of business or to an officer
or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded. Each such written consent shall bear
the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent. No written or
electronic consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless written or electronic consents signed by a

 



      
 

 



 

number of stockholders sufficient to take such action are delivered to the
corporation in the manner specified in this paragraph within sixty days of the
earliest dated consent so delivered.

 



 

If action is taken by consent of stockholders and in accordance with the
foregoing, there shall be filed with the records of the meetings of
stockholders the writing or writings comprising such consent.

 



 

If action is taken by less than unanimous consent of stockholders, prompt
notice of the taking of such action without a meeting shall be given to those
who have not consented in writing and a certificate signed and attested to by
the secretary that such notice was given shall be filed with the records of
the meetings of stockholders.

 



 

In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have
required the filing of a certificate under any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, if such action had been voted upon
by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such
provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision
concerning a vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given under
Section 228 of said General Corporation Law and that written notice has been
given as provided in such Section 228.

 



 

2.8. _Proxy Representation_. Every stockholder may authorize another person or
persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a stockholder is
entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting
to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent
without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by his
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the corporation generally. The authorization of a proxy may but
need not be limited to specified action; provided, however, that if a proxy
limits its authorization to a meeting or meetings of stockholders, unless
otherwise specifically provided such proxy shall entitle the holder thereof to
vote at any adjourned session but shall not be valid after the final
adjournment thereof.

 



 

2.9. _Inspectors_. The directors or the person presiding at the meeting may,
and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors of
election and any substitute inspectors to act at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best
of his ability. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares
of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect
of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine
all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote,
count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and
do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to
all stockholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the
inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter
determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.

 



      
 

 



 

2.10. _List of Stockholders_. The secretary shall prepare and make, at least
ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in his name. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who
are stockholders entitled to examine such list or to vote in person or by
proxy at such meeting.

 



 

Section 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 



 

3.1. _Number_. The corporation shall have one or more directors, the number of
directors to be determined from time to time by vote of a majority of the
directors then in office. Except in connection with the election of directors
at the annual meeting of stockholders, the number of directors may be
decreased only to eliminate vacancies by reason of death, resignation or
removal of one or more directors. No director need be a stockholder.

 



 

3.2. _Tenure_. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the certificate of
incorporation or by these by-laws, each director shall hold office until the
next annual meeting and until his successor is elected and qualified, or until
he sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.

 



 

3.3. _Powers_. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by
or under the direction of the board of directors who shall have and may
exercise all the powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and
things as are not by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws
directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



 

3.4. _Vacancies_. Vacancies and any newly created directorships resulting from
any increase in the number of directors may be filled by vote of the holders
of the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such director at
a meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the directors then in
office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, in each
case elected by the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such
directors. When one or more directors shall resign from the board, effective
at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those
who have resigned, who were elected by the particular class or series of stock
entitled to elect such resigning director or directors shall have power to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote or action by writing thereon to take
effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective. The
directors shall have and may exercise all their powers notwithstanding the
existence of one or more vacancies in their number, subject to any
requirements of law or of the certificate of incorporation or of these by-laws
as to the number of directors required for a quorum or for any vote or other
actions.

 



 

3.5. _Committees_. The board of directors may, by vote of a majority of the
whole board, (a) designate, change the membership of or terminate the
existence of any committee or committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the directors; (b) designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any such committee who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee; and (c) determine the extent to which
each such committee shall have and may exercise the powers of the board of
directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation,
including the power to authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to
all papers which require it and the power and authority to

 



      
 

 



 

declare dividends or to authorize the issuance of stock; excepting, however,
such powers which by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-
laws they are prohibited from so delegating. In the absence or
disqualification of any member of such committee and his alternate, if any,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another
member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any
such absent or disqualified member. Except as the board of directors may
otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its
business, but unless otherwise provided by the board or such rules, its
business shall be conducted as nearly as may be in the same manner as is
provided by these by-laws for the conduct of business by the board of
directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the board of directors upon request.

 



 

3.6. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be
held without call or notice at such places within or without the State of
Delaware and at such times as the board may from time to time determine,
provided that notice of the first regular meeting following any such
determination shall be given to absent directors. A regular meeting of the
directors may be held without call or notice immediately after and at the same
place as the annual meeting of stockholders.

 



 

3.7. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the board of directors may be
held at any time and at any place within or without the State of Delaware
designated in the notice of the meeting, when called by the chairman of the
board, if any, the president, or by one-third or more in number of the
directors. Notice of each such meeting shall be mailed to each director,
addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, or by electronic
communication or facsimile transmission at least five days before the date on
which the meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by
e-mail or facsimile, or be delivered personally or by telephone, not later
than the day before the day on which such meeting is to be held. Each such
notice shall state the time and place of the meeting. Notice of any meeting of
the board of directors need not be given to any director if he shall sign a
written waiver of notice or a waiver by electronic transmission thereof either
before or after the time stated therein for such meeting, or if he shall be
present at the meeting. Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver of a notice
need specify the purposes of the meeting.

 



 

3.8. _Quorum_. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the certificate
of incorporation or by these by-laws, at any meeting of the directors, a
majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum; a quorum
shall not in any case be less than one-third of the total number of directors
constituting the whole board. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time
by a majority of the votes cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is
present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.

 



 

3.9. _Action by Vote_. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, when a quorum is present at
any meeting the vote of a majority of the directors present shall be the act
of the board of directors.

 



 

3.10. _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the board of directors or a committee thereof may be taken
without a meeting if all

 



      
 

 



 

the members of the board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and such writing or writings
or electronic transmissions are filed with

 

the records of the meetings of the board or of such committee. Such consent
shall be treated for all purposes as the act of the board or of such
committee, as the case may be.

 



 

3.11. _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone_. Members of the
board of directors, or any committee designated by such board, may participate
in a meeting of such board or committee by means of conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating
in the meeting can hear each other or by any other means permitted by law.
Such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 



 

3.12. _Compensation_. In the discretion of the board of directors, each
director may be paid such fees for his services as director and be reimbursed
for his reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties as
director as the board of directors from time to time may determine. Nothing
contained in this section shall be construed to preclude any director from
serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving reasonable
compensation therefor.

 



 

3.13. _Interested Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) No contract or transaction between the corporation and one or more of its
directors or officers, or between the corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of the
corporations directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a
financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or
solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the
meeting of the board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or
transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such
purpose, if:

 



 

(1) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors
or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the
contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than
a quorum; or

 



 

(2) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or

 



 

(3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time
it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee
thereof, or the stockholders.

 



 

(b) Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence
of a quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee which
authorizes the contract or transaction

president, a treasurer, a secretary and such other officers, if any, as the

resignation in writing to the chairman of the board, if any, the president, or
the secretary or to a meeting of the board of directors. Such resignation
shall be effective upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some other
time, and without in either case the necessity of its being accepted unless
the resignation shall so state. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by
the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, a director (including
persons elected by stockholders or directors to fill vacancies in the board)
may be removed from office with or without cause by the vote of the holders of
a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the particular class or

signed by the chairman or vice chairman of the board, if any, or the president
or a vice president and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer or by the
secretary or an assistant secretary. Any of or all the signatures on the

Section 8. TRANSFER OF SHARES OF STOCK

 



 

8.1. _Transfer on Books_. Subject to the restrictions, if any, stated or noted
on the stock certificate, shares of stock may be transferred on the books of
the corporation by the surrender to the corporation or its transfer agent of
the certificate therefor properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
assignment and power of attorney properly executed, with necessary transfer
stamps affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as the
board of directors or the transfer agent of the corporation may reasonably
require. Except as may be otherwise required by law, by the certificate of
incorporation or by these by-laws, the corporation shall be entitled to treat
the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the owner of such stock
for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and the right to receive
notice and to vote or to give any consent with respect thereto and to be held
liable for such calls and assessments, if any, as may lawfully be made
thereon, regardless of any transfer, pledge or other disposition of such stock
until the shares have been properly transferred on the books of the
corporation.

 



 

It shall be the duty of each stockholder to notify the corporation of his post
office address.

 



 

8.2. _Record Date_. In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such
meeting. If no such record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

 



 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors. If no such record date has been fixed by the board of directors,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of
directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by
delivery to its registered office in Delaware by hand or certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, to its principal place of business
or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in
which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date
has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of
directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

 



 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record
date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such payment, exercise or
other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

Section 9\. INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

9.1. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Third Party Proceedings_.
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9, the corporation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding") (other than
an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was a
director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses
(including attorneys fees),

 



      
 

 



 

judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
such persons conduct was unlawful.

 



 

9.2. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions by or in the right
of the Corporation_. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9, the
corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by
or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation;
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the
court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.

 



 

9.3. _Successful Defense_. To the extent that a present or former director or
officer of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 9.1 or Section
9.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

 



 

9.4. _Indemnification of Others_. Subject to the other provisions of this
Section 9, the corporation shall have power to indemnify its employees and
agents to the extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or other applicable law. The board of directors shall have
the power to delegate to such person or persons the determination of whether
employees or agents shall be indemnified.

 



 

9.5. _Advanced Payment of Expenses_. Expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by an officer or director of the corporation in defending any
Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of the person to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that
the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 9 or the
General Corporation Law of

 



      
 

 



 

the State of Delaware. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid
upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section
9.8, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an officer of the
corporation (except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a
director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in
any Proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (a) by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, even
though less than a quorum, or (b) by a committee of such directors designated
by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, that facts known to the decision-making
party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and
convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such
person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation.

 



 

9.6. _Limitation on Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. Subject to
the requirements in Section 9.3 and the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, the corporation shall not be required to provide indemnification
or, with respect to clauses (a), (c) and (d) below, advance expenses to any
person pursuant to this Section 9:

 



 

(a) in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
person except (i) as otherwise required by law, (ii) in specific cases if the
Proceeding was authorized by the board of directors, or (iii) as is required
to be made under Section 9.7;

 



 

(b) on account of any Proceeding (or part thereof) against such person
providing for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to the
provisions of Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, or similar provisions of any
federal, state or local statutory law or common law;

 



 

(c) for expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of
such person under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or
otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid; or

 



 

(d) if prohibited by applicable law.

 



 

9.7. _Determination; Claim_. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses under this Section 9 is not paid in full within 60 days after a
written claim therefor has been received by the corporation, the claimant may
file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such
claim. In any such suit, the corporation shall have the burden of proving that
the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement
of expenses under applicable law.

 



 

9.8. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 9 shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other

 



      
 

 



 

rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under the certificate of incorporation or any statute, bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office. The corporation is specifically authorized
to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers,
employees or agents respecting indemnification and advancement of expenses, to
the fullest extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware or other applicable law.

 



 

9.9. _Insurance_. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 



 

9.10. _Survival_. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses
conferred by this Section 9 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be
a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.

 



 

9.11. _Effect of Repeal or Modification_. Any repeal or modification of this
Section 9 shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any
person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such
repeal or modification.

 



 

9.12. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Section 9, references to the
"corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed
in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued,
would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers,
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this
Section 9 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such
person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued. For purposes of this Section 9, references to "other
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall
include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee
benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the corporation"
shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director,
officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation"
as referred to in this Section 9.

10.1. Subject to alteration by the directors, the seal of the corporation
