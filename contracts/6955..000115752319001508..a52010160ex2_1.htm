Article II 
  Purchase and Sale

 

Section 2.01 Purchase  and Sale of the Purchased Interests and the Foreign
Notes. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller
agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to, or cause its direct  or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary to, purchase from Seller, the Foreign Notes
and all of the Purchased Interests at the Closing, free and clear of all Liens
other than restrictions on transfer arising under applicable securities Laws.

 

Section 2.02 Pre-Closing  Restructuring.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall effect or cause its Subsidiaries to
effect, as promptly as  practicable, all transfers and take all such actions
as are necessary so that as of the Closing the Internal Restructuring shall be
consummated, any assets, Contracts, rights, interests or properties of the
Group Companies described in _Schedule _ 2.02(a)(ii) (collectively, the "
_Retained Assets_ ") shall be transferred and assigned to Retained Companies,
any Liabilities of the Group Companies (x) to the extent not related to the
Business or (y) described in _Schedule_ 2.02(a)(iii)  (the " _Retained
Liabilities_ ") shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be assumed
by the Retained Companies and any assets (x) primarily related to the Business
that are not held by the Group Companies or (y) set forth on _Schedule _
2.02(a)(iv) and, in each case, the Liabilities to the extent related thereto
shall be transferred and assigned by the applicable Retained Companies to the
Group Companies (" _Transferred Business Assets_ "). The transactions
contemplated by  the foregoing clauses (i) to (iv) are collectively referred
to as the " _Preparatory Business Transfers_ ". Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Retained Asset  or Transferred Business Asset (or any
right thereunder) or any Retained Liability if an attempted assignment,
without the consent of, or other action by, any third party (other than a
Governmental Authority) would constitute a breach thereunder or  adversely
affect in any material respect the rights of any of the Retained Companies or
Group Companies, as applicable, thereunder (the " _Non-Assignable Assets_ ").
Seller and Buyer shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to 
use, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all applicable third
party consents required in order for the Preparatory Business Transfers to
occur prior to the Closing. If such consent is not obtained or such other
action is not taken prior  to the Closing, and except to the extent
substitute services are specifically provided in the Transition Services
Agreement for any Non-Assignable Assets, then (i) Seller and Buyer shall use,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates and  Subsidiaries to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts for twelve (12) months after the Closing to
obtain all applicable consents required in order for the Preparatory Business
Transfers to be consummated in full and shall take such other  actions as are
reasonably requested by Buyer or Seller in order to obtain such consents, and
(ii) Seller and Buyer agree to enter into alternative arrangements (such as a
license, sublease or operating agreement) until such time as such consent has
been obtained which result in Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries receiving all
the benefits and bearing all the Liabilities and burdens with respect to any
such  Non-Assignable Asset. Once a consent described in this _Section_
2.02(a) is obtained from, or such other action described in this _Section_
2.02(a) is taken by, such third party, the applicable Non-Assignable Assets
shall be  deemed to have been automatically assigned and transferred to (x) a
Retained Company designated by Seller in the case of Retained Assets and
Retained Liabilities or (y) a Group Company designated by Buyer in the case of
the Transferred Business  Assets, in each case, on the terms set forth in
this Agreement, as of immediately prior to the Closing, for no additional
consideration.

 

 

18  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that  Buyer
will purchase the Foreign Notes and all of the Purchased Interests, the assets
(including any Permitted Liens thereon) and Liabilities of the Group Companies
(excluding the Retained Assets and the Retained Liabilities) will remain the 
assets and Liabilities, respectively, of the Group Companies and all Business
Employees who are employed by the Group Companies at the close of business on
the  day immediately prior to the Closing will remain employees of the Group
Companies at and immediately after the Closing.

 

Section 2.03 Purchase  Price; Allocation of Purchase Price; Withholding.

 

(a) The " _Purchase Price_ " in the aggregate for the Foreign Notes and the
Purchased Interests shall, subject to the  adjustments for the Adjustment
Amount set forth in _Section_ 2.05, be an amount in cash equal to (i) two
hundred eleven million, five hundred thousand dollars ($211,500,000.00),
_minus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_   (iii) the
Estimated Closing Date Cash _minus_ (iv) the Estimated Transaction Expenses.

 

(b) _Allocation_.

 

 

(i) Seller shall prepare an allocation of the  Purchase Price among the
Subsidiary Interests and the Foreign Notes (the " _Proposed Allocation
Statement_ "), and shall deliver the Proposed Allocation Statement to Buyer
for its review within forty-five (45) days after the date of this  Agreement.
Buyer shall have twenty (20) days after receipt within which to review and
consent to the Proposed Allocation Statement (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event that Buyer does not agree with the
Proposed  Allocation Statement and provides Seller with written notice of,
and basis for, such disagreement during such period, Seller and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences; _provided_ that if Buyer
does not provide such  written notice during such period, the Proposed
Allocation Statement shall become the " _Closing Allocation Statement_." In
the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any differences within
twenty (20) days after delivery of the  Proposed Allocation Statement by
Seller to Buyer, the Parties shall submit any disputed items to the Auditor
for resolution. Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith to cause the Auditor
to deliver its comments to the Proposed Allocation  Statement within ten (10)
days after such submission, and the allocation statement as revised by the
Auditor shall become the Closing Allocation Statement. Promptly after the
Determination Date, Seller shall update the Closing Allocation  Statement to
reflect the final Purchase Price, taking into account the adjustments
determined pursuant to _Section_ 2.05. The fees and expenses of the Auditor
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by
Seller,  and the decision of the Auditor shall be final and binding on the
Parties.

 

 

19  

(ii) The Parties agree that they will not, and  will not permit any of their
respective Affiliates to, take a position (except as required pursuant to any
order of a Governmental Authority) on any Tax Return or in any audit or
examination before any Governmental Authority that is in any way 
inconsistent with the Closing Allocation Statement (as such may be adjusted in
accordance with this _Section_ 2.03(b)); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall prevent the Parties or any of their Affiliates from (A) 
settling, or require them to litigate before any court, any challenge,
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or
arising out of the Closing Allocation Statement or (B) complying with
applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price
such amounts as it is required  to deduct and withhold for Tax purposes under
Laws regarding Taxes. If Buyer determines that any deduction or withholding is
required in respect of a payment pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall
provide written notice to Seller no less than ten  (10) days prior to the
date on which such deduction or withholding is to be made or as soon as
reasonably practicable if Buyer determines in good faith within such ten (10)
day period that it is required to deduct or withhold for Tax, together with 
an explanation of the type of, and reason for, deduction or withholding. The
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to mitigate any
such requirement to the maximum extent permitted by Law. Buyer shall promptly
remit all  deducted or withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with Law and shall promptly provide Seller with a
receipt issued by the Governmental Authority or other reasonable evidence of
such remittance. Any amounts so  deducted, withheld and remitted consistent
with the terms of this _Section_ 2.03(c) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to Seller or the applicable Retained
Company.

 

Section 2.04 Closing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing (the "
_Closing_ ") of the purchase and sale of the Foreign Notes and the Purchased
Interests hereunder shall take  place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP,
330 North Wabash Avenue, Suite 2800, Chicago, Illinois 60611, (i) on the fifth
(5th) Business Day after all the conditions precedent set forth in _Article
_VIII shall have been  satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that,
by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such
conditions would be so satisfied)) or (ii) on such other date as the Parties
may mutually agree in writing. The date on  which the Closing actually occurs
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Unless otherwise
explicitly specified, all transactions taking place at the Closing shall be
deemed to occur simultaneously.

 

 

20  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, in consideration for  the sale of the Foreign Notes and the
Purchased Interests, Buyer shall pay to Seller or to one or more Retained
Companies designated by Seller located in the United States (except with
respect to payments attributable to the Foreign Notes, which  may be made to
the applicable Foreign Seller), the Purchase Price (prior to giving effect to
the adjustment set forth in _Section_ 2.05) in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by Seller, by  written
notice to Buyer, which written notice shall be delivered not later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) In addition, the following deliveries shall be made prior to or at the
Closing: 


 

 

(i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the certificates representing any
certificated Purchased Interests,  duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
stock powers (or other instruments of transfer) duly executed in blank by

(ii) Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,

and

 

(v) Seller shall deliver a certification in the form of _Exhibit _ _E_.

 

 

Section 2.05 Adjustment  Amount.

 

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the  Closing Date and in
no event more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith estimates of (i) the Closing Date
Net  Working Capital and the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment,
(ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Closing Date Cash and (iv) the amount of the
Closing Date Transaction Expenses  (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_
"), in each case, calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
Together with the Estimated Closing Statement, Seller shall provide to Buyer
such supporting documentation, information (including  reasonable access to
the records and personnel of the Group Companies and Seller) and calculations
as are reasonably requested by Buyer to review the calculations set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement. In the event that Buyer notifies Seller 
that there are reasonably apparent errors in the Estimated Closing Statement,
Buyer and Seller shall discuss such errors in good faith and Seller shall
consider in good faith whether to revise any of its calculations prior to
delivering a final  version of the Estimated Closing Statement in accordance
with this _Section_ 2.05(a).

 

 

21  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable  following the Closing Date, and in any
event within ninety (90) days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller (i) an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Group Companies as of
the Effective  Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of
the Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Adjustment, (iii) a  calculation of the Closing Date Indebtedness, (iv) a
calculation of the Closing Date Cash and (v) a calculation of the Closing Date
Transaction Expenses, (A) in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and  (iv),
determined without giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustments as a result of the
application of purchase accounting); _provided_ that, the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital hereunder shall take into account any non-
Income Tax deductions, credits or other Tax benefits accruing in a  Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including all such deductions, credits or benefits
accruing from costs incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and borne by Seller, (B) in each case, determined without
giving effect to  any financing transactions in connection therewith or by
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) at or after the
Closing and (C) in each case,  determined without giving effect to any action
or omission by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies)
with respect to the Group Companies following the Closing that is not in the
ordinary course of business  consistent with past practices. The Closing
Balance Sheet and calculations contemplated by clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and
(v) shall be prepared in accordance with the  Accounting Principles.
Following the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller and its Representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the records and personnel of
the Group Companies  and (subject to the execution of customary work paper
access letters if requested by) auditors of Buyer to the extent relevant to
the preparation of the Closing  Balance Sheet and calculations contemplated
by clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) and shall cause the personnel of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) to reasonably cooperate
with Seller and its Representatives in connection  with their review of the
Closing Balance Sheet and calculations contemplated by clauses (ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v).

 

(c) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Net  Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash or the Closing Date Transaction Expenses,
it shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such  disagreement, within sixty (60)
days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that Seller
does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such sixty (60)-day
period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing  Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing
Date Cash, and the Closing Date  Transaction Expenses delivered by Buyer,
which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In
the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a  period of forty-five (45)
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Net  Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash and the Closing Date Transaction Expenses.
If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements,
then Crowe LLP (or such other  independent accounting or financial consulting
firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and
Seller) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. The
Auditor shall determine as promptly as  practicable, but in any event within
forty-five (45) days of the date on which such dispute is referred to the
Auditor, whether the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and (only with respect to the  remaining disagreements
submitted to the Auditor) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment, the
Closing Date Indebtedness,  the Closing Date Cash or the Closing Date
Transaction Expenses require adjustment based on the written submissions of
Seller and Buyer. In resolving the remaining disagreements, the Auditor (i)
shall be bound by  the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Seller or Buyer
and (iii) shall base its decision  solely upon the written submissions of
Seller and Buyer and the terms of this Agreement (and not upon an independent
review). The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid in inverse
proportion by  Seller and Buyer as they may prevail on matters resolved by
the Auditor, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Auditor at the time the determination of the Auditor is rendered. The
determination of the Auditor  shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Parties. The date on which the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the
Closing  Date Cash and the Closing Date Transaction Expenses are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section_ 2.05(c) is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Determination Date_."

 

 

22  

(d) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, means (i)
the Closing Date Net  Working Capital Adjustment (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section _2.05(c)), _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, _minus_ the Closing Date Indebtedness (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section _2.05(c)),  _plus_ (iii) the Closing Date Cash (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section_ 2.05(c)), _minus_ the
Estimated Closing Date Cash, _plus_ (iv) the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
_minus_ the Closing Date  Transaction Expenses (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section_ 2.05(c)). If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount
(the " _Increase Amount_ "), and if the  Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute value of
the Adjustment Amount (the " _Deficit Amount_ "). The Adjustment Amount shall
be paid in accordance with _Section_ 2.05(e).

 

(e) If there is an Increase Amount, then, promptly following the Determination
Date, and in any event  within five (5) Business Days of the Determination
Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller (or one or more Retained Companies located in
the United States and designated by Seller) an amount in cash equal to the
Increase Amount in immediately available  funds by wire transfer to an
account or accounts designated by Seller, by written notice to Buyer. If there
is a Deficit Amount, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days of the Determination  Date, Seller
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the
Deficit Amount in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
or accounts designated by Buyer, by written notice to Seller. For U.S.
federal  income and other applicable Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by
Law, any Increase Amount or Deficit Amount pursuant to this _Section_ 2.05
shall be treated as an adjustment to the portion of the Purchase Price
attributable to the  relevant Foreign Notes and Subsidiary Interests.

 

 

23  

Section 2.06 Deferred Payment. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause any of its Subsidiaries to, pay to Seller an aggregate amount
equal to  $2,998,600 in accordance with this _Section 2.06_. The Deferred
Payment shall be paid in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated in writing by Seller to Buyer, in four
quarterly payments of  $749,650, with the first such payment being due on the
last Business Day of the first full fiscal quarter immediately following the
Closing Date (assuming a fiscal year end of August 31st).

by their terms address matters as of a specified date, then as of such date)
that:

 

Section 3.01 Existence. Seller, and each Foreign Seller, is duly organized,
validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing (or local
equivalent) under the Laws of its  jurisdiction of organization, formation or
incorporation, as applicable. Seller, and each Foreign Seller, is duly
licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or operation
of its assets or the character of its activities is  such as to require it to
be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, interfere with, prevent or delay its ability to enter into and 
perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party
or consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

Section 3.02 Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by Seller
and each Foreign Seller of the Transaction Documents, in each case, to which
it is a party and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
are within its organizational powers and have been (or will be prior to

of Seller or each Foreign Seller, as  applicable. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and each Foreign Seller and

constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of  Seller and each Foreign
Seller, enforceable against Seller and the Foreign Sellers in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies 
generally and to general principles of equity. Each other Transaction Document
shall be duly and validly executed by Seller or the applicable Foreign Seller
party thereto at or prior to the Closing and, upon such execution and delivery
by Seller or  such Foreign Seller, as the case may be, and the due and valid
execution and delivery of such Transaction Document by each other party
thereto shall constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller or
such Foreign Seller party thereto  enforceable against Seller or such Foreign
Seller party thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and to  general principles of
equity.

completeness of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this
Agreement, no consent, approval  or authorization of, or declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Seller or
the Foreign Sellers with respect to Seller's or such Foreign Seller's
execution or delivery of the Transaction Documents or the  consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby, except for applicable requirements of
Competition Laws and Share Transfer Laws, those consents disclosed in
_Schedule_ 3.03(b) and any other consents, approvals, authorizations, 
declarations or filings, the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business,
taken as a whole.

 

Section 3.04 Noncontravention. Subject to the receipt of the consents,
approvals, authorizations and other requirements set forth in _Section_
3.03(a) or in _Schedule_ 3.03(a)  or (b), and except as may result from any
facts or circumstances relating solely to Buyer, the execution and delivery by
Seller and the Foreign Sellers of the Transaction Documents to which each is a
party and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated thereby do not

or by which any property or asset of the Business is bound, violate any
provision of, or result in a breach of, the Organizational Documents  of
Seller or any Foreign Seller, violate any provision of, result in a breach of,

time, or both) under, result in or give rise to a right of termination,
assignment,  cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, require a
consent, notice, notification, waiver or the payment of any penalty pursuant
to, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon
any of the properties or  assets of the Business under any provision of any
Material Contract or result in a violation or revocation of any Permit, except
to the extent that the occurrence of any of the foregoing items set forth in
_clause_ _(c)_ or _clause  (d)_ would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business, taken as
a whole.

 

Section 3.05 Group Companies.

 

(a) Each Group Company other than the Restructuring Newcos is (and each
Restructuring Newco, as of its  formation or incorporation and the Closing,
is) duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, formation or incorporation, as applicable. Each Group Company
has all corporate powers and all Permits required  to carry on its business,
except for those Permits the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business,
taken as a whole.

 

(b) _Schedule_ 3.05(b)  sets forth, other than with respect to the
Restructuring Newcos, (x) the name and jurisdiction of organization of each
Group Company, (y) the number of authorized, issued and outstanding equity
interests of each Group Company and (z) holder(s) of  record of all of the
outstanding equity interests of each Group Company. Seller is the record and
beneficial owner of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the
Targets, free and clear of  any Lien (other than transfer restrictions under
applicable securities Laws), and Seller has the right, authority and power to
sell, assign and transfer such equity interests of the Targets. Buyer shall
acquire good, valid and marketable title to  the equity interests of the
Targets, free and clear of any Lien, other than Liens created by transfer
restrictions under applicable securities Laws. Seller has delivered to Buyer
complete copies of the  Organizational Documents of each Group Company as
currently in effect, and no Group Company is in violation of any provision of
such Organizational Documents in any material respect. Except as set forth on
_Schedule_ 3.05(b), there are no (and at the Closing, after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, there will not be any) outstanding
options, warrants, calls, purchase rights,  subscription rights, exchange
rights or other rights, convertible securities, agreements or commitments of
any kind pursuant to which any Group Company is or may become obligated to (i)
issue, transfer,  sell or otherwise dispose of any of its securities, or any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for its securities,

any Group Company.

 

 

25  

(c) As of the date hereof, all of the Shares of the Group Companies  other

Newco, as its formation or incorporation and the Closing) are (x) duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and (y) owned
beneficially and of  record by Seller or a Group Company, free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. None of the Shares have been issued in
violation of, or are subject to, any preemptive or subscription rights. Except

stock-based performance unit, arrangement, undertaking or agreement to which
any  Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) is a
party that requires, and there are no securities of any Group Companies
outstanding that upon conversion or exchange would require,  the issuance of
any capital stock or other equity interest of any Group Company or other
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to
subscribe for or purchase any capital stock or other equity interest of any
Group  Company. Except as contemplated by the Preparatory Business Transfers,
no Seller and no Group Company is a party to any voting trust or other
agreement with  respect to the voting, redemption, sale, transfer or other
disposition of the interests of any Group Company. There is no Indebtedness of
any Group Company having the right to vote (or that is convertible into, or
exercisable or exchangeable for,  securities having the right to vote) on any
matters which holders of Shares may vote.

 

Section 3.06 Financial Statements.

 

(a) Attached as _Schedule_ 3.06(a)(i) are true and complete copies of the

(other than the  Restructuring Newcos) for the fiscal years ended August 31,

(b) Seller has devised and maintained systems of  internal accounting
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of Seller's financial statements for the fiscal years ended August
31, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. There (i)
are no significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of  internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to materially adversely affect the Business's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, or (ii) is not any fraud,
whether or not material, that  involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in Seller's internal controls over financial
reporting.

preparation for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Preparatory Business Transfers), since the Balance Sheet Date, the  Business

practices, there has not been any event, occurrence or development that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a  Material Adverse Effect and through the date of this Agreement, no action
with respect to the Business or any Group Company has been taken that would,
if taken after the date hereof, have required the consent of Buyer under
clauses (i), (iii), (vi)  and (viii) - (xxi) of Section 5.01(a).

 

Section 3.08 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules, as of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is no Liability of the

with all applicable Laws in all material respects, and no Group Company or
Retained Company has received any notice to the effect that a Governmental
Authority claimed or alleged that the Business was not in compliance in all

respective officers, directors, employees, agents, distributors, and other
individuals or entities acting for or on behalf of the Business (collectively,
the " _Relevant Persons_ ") have not directly or indirectly violated or taken

behalf of, the Business engaged directly or indirectly in transactions: (i)
connected with any of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria; (ii)
connected with any government, country, or other  individual or entity that

(a) Buyer has been provided a true and correct copy of  the terms of the
standard warranties provided by the Business as of the date hereof with
respect to products sold by the Business. Except as would not reasonably be

Business, taken as a whole, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
provided any warranty with respect to a material amount of products of the
Business that remains in effect and materially deviates from such standard
warranties. There are  no claims pending or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened against any Group Company with respect to the quality of or absence
of defects in such products or services of the Business that would be expected
to result in a material Liability to the  Business, taken as a whole.

 

(b) There are no, and since January 1, 2016 there have  been no, product
liability Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the Business, which if
successful, would reasonably be expected to be material to the Business, taken
as a  whole. There have been no product recalls (whether voluntary or
involuntary) of the products produced by the Business since January 1, 2016.

 

Section 3.26 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article III, or any other
Transaction Document, none of the Retained Companies or any of their 
respective Representatives has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Seller or the Foreign Sellers,
Seller's Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) or any of the Shares or
with respect to any  other information provided, or made available, to Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Seller and its Affiliates and
Representatives will not have or be subject to any Liability  to Buyer, its
Affiliates or Representatives resulting from Buyer's use of, or the use by any
of its Affiliates or Representatives of, any such information, including
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to  Buyer, its Affiliates or Representatives in any "data rooms,"
teaser, confidential information memorandum or management presentations in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the

Article  IV 
  Representations and Warranties of Buyer

 

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date (or, in  the case of representations and warranties
that by their terms address matters as of a specified date, then as of such
date) that:

 

Section 4.01 Existence and Power. Buyer is a limited liability company duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws  of the State of
Delaware and has the requisite limited liability company power and authority
to own or lease its assets and to conduct its business in all material
respects as it is now being conducted. Buyer is duly licensed or qualified in
each  jurisdiction in which the ownership or operation of its assets or the
character of its activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
reasonably be expected to,  individually or in the aggregate, interfere with,
prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

Section 4.02 Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer
of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated thereby are within the limited liability
company powers of Buyer and have been (or will be prior to execution) duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and  delivered by Buyer and (assuming the due
and valid execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller) constitutes a
legal, valid and binding agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and to general principles of equity. Each other Transaction
Document shall be duly and validly executed by Buyer at or prior to  the
Closing and, upon such execution and delivery by Buyer and the due and valid
execution and delivery of such Transaction Document by each other party
thereto, shall constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of Buyer,
enforceable against  Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and to general principles
of equity.

 

Section 4.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the  transactions contemplated thereby require no
material action by or in respect of, or material filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Competition Laws and the Share Transfer Laws.

 

Section 4.04 Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation
of  the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (a) violate the
Organizational Documents of Buyer, (b) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in _Section _4.03, violate any Law, (c) require any consent or
other action by  any Person under, constitute a default under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material
right or obligation or to a loss of any material benefit to which Buyer or any
of its Affiliates is entitled under  any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (d) result in the
creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (except, in the case of clauses (c) and  (d), as would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, interfere with,
prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
consummate the  transactions contemplated thereby).

 

 

42  

Section 4.05 Financial Ability.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has  received an executed equity
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ "), from the Guarantor, pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed
to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of  $216,500,000, subject
to terms and conditions set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), which
Equity Commitment Letter expressly provides that Seller is a third-party
beneficiary thereto. A true and complete copy of the Equity Commitment 
Letter and the ABL Debt Commitment Letter has been previously provided to
Seller. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by such Equity Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date
hereof. The Equity  Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto,
in each case, except as limited by the application of bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws  relating to or affecting
creditors' rights or to general principles of equity, and is in full force and
effect, and has not been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded
in any respect. As of the date hereof, no amendment or  modification to, or
withdrawal, termination or rescission of, any Equity Commitment Letter is
currently contemplated. Assuming the funding in full of the Equity Financing
on the Closing Date, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of 
Seller set forth in _Article III_ and the performance by Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement, Buyer will have on the Closing Date
sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer has not  incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or
liability of any kind, and is not contemplating or aware of any obligation,
commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, in either case, which would
reasonably be expected to impair or  adversely affect Buyer's ability to use
the Equity Financing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this
Agreement, Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to
Buyer's consummation of any financing arrangements, Buyer's obtaining of any
financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing
to  Buyer. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other legally
binding agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the Equity Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the applicable Equity Commitment Letter
between the parties  thereto that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the availability of the Equity Financing to be funded on the Closing
Date pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter. The Equity
Financing to be funded on the Closing Date is  subject to no conditions
precedent other than those set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. As of
the date hereof, to the knowledge of Buyer, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Article III_   and the
performance by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement in satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.02, Buyer (A) is not in material
breach of the Equity Commitment Letter and no event has occurred which, with
or without  notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material
default or material breach on the part of Buyer under the Equity Commitment
Letter and (B) does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the availability of the Equity  Financing would not be satisfied by the
Closing Date or that the Equity Financing would not be available to Buyer on
the Closing Date.

 

 

43  

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,  Guarantor has
delivered to Seller the duly executed Guaranty. The Guaranty is in full force
and effect, has not been amended or modified, and is a legal, valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of the Guarantor. No event has occurred which
(with  or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a default
on the part of the Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 

Section 4.06 Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, threatened in writing against Buyer, except for such Actions as would
not reasonably be  expected to, individually or in the aggregate, interfere
with, prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
consummate the transactions contemplated  thereby.

 

Section 4.07 Solvency. Assuming that the conditions set forth in _Sections_
8.02(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied at the Closing, and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at and  immediately after
the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) on a
consolidated basis (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its
assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present fair 
saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required to pay
its probable liability on its recourse debts as they mature or become due),
(b) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its
business and (c) will  not have incurred and does not plan to incur debts
beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

 

Section 4.08 Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Purchased
Interests and Foreign Notes for investment for its own account and not with a
view to, or for sale in  connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer
(either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its investment in the  Purchased Interests and
Foreign Notes and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.
Buyer understands and agrees that the Purchased Interests and Foreign Notes
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated  or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, except
pursuant to an exemption from such registration available under the Securities
Act, and without compliance with state, local and foreign securities Laws, in
each case,  to the extent applicable.

 

Section 4.09 Finders' Fees. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf
of Buyer or any of its  Affiliates that might be entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.10 No Additional Representations; No Reliance.

 

 

44  

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the  Retained Companies or any
of their respective Representatives, or any other Person, has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Group Companies, the Shares or 
other matters that are not specifically included in Article III of this
Agreement (subject to the Disclosure Schedules) or any other Transaction
Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the
Retained Companies or any of  their respective Representatives, or any other
Person, has made a representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to, and
neither Seller nor any other Person shall be subject to any Liability to Buyer
or any other Person resulting from, Seller or  its Representatives making
available to Buyer, (i) any projections, estimates or budgets for the Group
Companies or (ii) any materials, documents or information relating to Seller
or the Group Companies made available to Buyer or its  Representatives in
certain "data rooms," offering memorandum, confidential information
memorandum, management presentations or otherwise, in each case, except as
expressly covered by a representation or warranty set forth in Article III of
this  Agreement or any other Transaction Document. In connection with Buyer's
investigation of the Group Companies, Seller has delivered, or made available
to Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives, certain projections and other
forecasts,  including but not limited to, projected financial statements,
cash flow items and other data of the Group Companies relating to certain
business plan information of the Group Companies. Buyer acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in  attempting to make such projections and
other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, and
that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other  forecasts and plans so
furnished to it. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that none of the Retained
Companies or any of their respective Representatives has made any
representation or warranty with respect to such projections and other
forecasts and  plans except as set forth in Article III of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, it is the explicit
intent of the Parties that  none of the Retained Companies or any of their
respective Representatives are making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in Article III of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,  including any implied
warranty or representation as to the value, condition, non-infringement,
merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose as to any of
the assets of the Group Companies and, except as expressly provided in 
Article III of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document, and subject
to the terms and conditions of Article III of this Agreement, it is understood
that Buyer is acquiring the Group Companies as is and where is with any and
all faults and  defects as of the Closing Date.

 

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that it is not 
relying on any representation or warranty of the Retained Companies or any of
their respective Representatives, other than those representations and
warranties specifically set forth in Article III of  this Agreement and any
other Transaction Document. Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
Liabilities, results of operations and projected operations of the Group 
Companies and the nature and condition of their properties, assets and
businesses and, in making the determination to proceed with the transactions
contemplated hereby, has relied solely on the results  of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
and any other Transaction Document.

Section 5.05 Group Company Guarantees.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts with the reasonable
cooperation of Seller to  replace or substitute the Group Company Guarantees

counterparty may reasonably request, and to the  extent any Group Company
Guarantee is replaced, obtain from the respective beneficiary, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, on or before the Closing Date,
valid and binding written unconditional release of the Retained  Companies,
as applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on or after the
Closing Date, under the Group Company Guarantee, which shall be effective as
of the Closing.

 

(b) If the Group Company Guarantee has not been fully and unconditionally
released as of the Closing, (i)  Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to terminate, or, if the
Parties are unable to so terminate, cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be
substituted or backstopped in all respects for any  Retained Company in
respect of, all obligations under such Group Company Guarantee, (ii) Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees for any Damages
arising from or relating to such Group Company Guarantee, including any claim
or  demand for payment made on any Retained Company under, and any fees in

that Seller shall renew or extend any Group Company  Guarantees that are
surety bonds for no less than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date if
Buyer has not replaced such bonds prior to the date such bonds would have
otherwise expired. To the extent that the Retained Companies have
performance  obligations under the Group Company Guarantee, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) perform such obligations on behalf of
the Retained Companies or (y) otherwise take such action as reasonably
requested by Seller so as to put the  Retained Companies in the same position
as if Buyer, and not a Retained Company, had performed or were performing such
obligations.

 

 

52  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that at any time on  or after the Closing Date, none of the
Retained Companies will have any obligation to renew the Group Company
Guarantee after its expiration.

 

Section 5.06 Use of Retained Marks.

Retained Marks; _provided_ , _however_ , that as promptly as practicable after
Closing, but in no event after the conclusion of such nine (9)-month period, 
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, cease and discontinue any
use of the Retained Marks and, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, remove all
Retained Marks from all such supplies and materials, in each case, whether
such supplies or  materials are held by Buyer or the Group Companies or under
the control of Buyer or the Group Companies. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not require the Group Companies to modify any existing books
and records of the Group Companies  that bear the Retained Marks ( _provided_
that such books and records are used for historical reference in a non-
trademark manner and not for marketing or promotional purposes) or prevent

assets or the character of its activities  is such as to require it to be
licensed or qualified in such jurisdiction, and providing notice to all
customers, vendors and other suppliers of such name change.

(d) If, after the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Group  Companies) identifies any Intellectual Property Rights (other than
Trademarks) that are owned by Seller and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof and that were used or held for use by Seller and its Subsidiaries
during the twelve (12) month period  prior to the Closing for purposes of
conducting the Business, then Seller, on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries,
and each of its and their successors and assigns, agrees not to sue Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (or any of its or their contractors  providing services
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Business) for
infringement or other violations of such Intellectual Property Rights. solely
to the extent arising from, in each case, Buyer's or its Affiliates' conduct
of  the Business (and the natural evolution thereof). The foregoing covenant

the business of the Group Companies to which such Intellectual Property Rights
pertain. The  foregoing covenant shall run with title to such Intellectual
Property Rights and Seller agrees to obtain an enforceable written agreement
to abide by this covenant from any assignee or other Person to whom Seller or
its Subsidiaries may convey any  interest in any such Intellectual Property
Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding Seller's failure to
obtain such a written agreement, such covenant shall nevertheless be binding
upon any successor or assignee of any  interest in any such Intellectual
Property Rights.

Insurance Policy necessary to the binding of the RandW Insurance Policy. The RandW
Insurance Policy shall provide that PartnerRe Ireland Insurance DAC (the " _R
andW Insurer_") shall have no right of subrogation against the Retained
Companies, and the RandW Insurer has waived any such right of subrogation,
except in the  case of Fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy is not a condition to the
Closing and Buyer shall remain obligated, subject only to the  satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article _VIII of this Agreement, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer will
promptly pay all premiums required  for the full term of the RandW Insurance
Policy, and will otherwise comply in all material respects with all of its
obligations under the RandW Insurance Policy.

commercially reasonable efforts to continue to carry, prior to the Closing,
the Insurance Policies with respect to the Business in force as of the date of
this Agreement, including renewing any policies expiring during such  period,
and (ii) shall not cause any intentional breach, default or cancellation
(other than expiration and replacement of policies in the ordinary course of

agreements that  would have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material and adverse effect on the Business, taken as a whole. In the event
that any claim or occurrence occurs after the date hereof for which coverage
may be afforded to the Group Companies  under the Insurance Policies, Seller
shall take commercially reasonable actions necessary to preserve and pursue
the Group Companies' coverage rights for such claim or occurrence.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and  shall cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) not to, assert
any right, claim or interest to or under any insurance policies of the
Retained Companies (excluding any insurance policies of and solely with
respect to  the Group Companies or their respective predecessors) or rights
to proceeds thereof in effect on or prior to the Closing Date relating to the
Group Companies, other than in accordance with _Section_ 5.08(c).

 

(c) From and after the Closing, with respect to any  claim or occurrence
relating to the Group Companies, the Business, Business Employees or former
employees of the Group Companies that would be covered by any of the Retained
Companies' occurrence-based (but not claims-made or occurrence-reported) 
insurance policies (such policies, the " _Available Insurance Policies_ " and
such claims, the " _Coverage Claims_ "), Buyer, on behalf of the Group
Companies, may access, submit claims and seek coverage for such Coverage
Claims under the  Available Insurance Policies, subject to the terms and
conditions of such Available Insurance Policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that

claims,  (iv) the Group Companies shall be liable for any out-of-pocket fees,
costs or expenses incurred by Seller through the insurers or reinsurers of the
Available Insurance Policies relating to any unsuccessful coverage claims and

abrogate in any manner any  rights of Seller to insurance coverage for any
matter, whether relating to the Group Companies or otherwise, and (y) Seller
shall retain the exclusive right to control all of their insurance policies
and programs, including the Available Insurance  Policies, including the
right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and to amend, modify,
terminate or waive any such insurance policies and programs or any rights 
thereunder; _provided_ that Seller shall not amend, modify, terminate or waive
any coverage under any Available Insurance Policies with respect to periods
prior to the Closing Date in a manner that would impair coverage thereunder
available  for Coverage Claims or otherwise limit the rights of Buyer under
this _Section_ 5.08(c); _provided_ _further_ , that the Group Companies shall
cooperate with Seller, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, with
respect to  Coverage Claims and requests for benefits and sharing such
information as is reasonably necessary in order to permit Seller to manage and
conduct its insurance matters as Seller reasonably deems appropriate.

 

 

55

the rights and obligations of the Parties under Article IX; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any insurance proceeds actually collected with respect to a
particular set of Damages shall be taken into account under  and to the
extent required by _Section_ 9.04. No payments due under this _Section_ 5.08
shall affect, be affected by, or be subject to set off against, any adjustment
to Purchase Price. Whenever this _Section_ 5.08 requires any  Group Company
to take any action after the Closing, such requirement shall be deemed to
constitute an undertaking on the part of Buyer to take such action or to cause
such Group Company to take such action.

of the Retained Companies),  on the one hand, and Buyer (or any of its

Liability of a Group Company, in order to settle or compromise, or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to, any  such Action, Seller and
Buyer, and their respective Subsidiaries, must comply with the provisions of

compromise or consent.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall use their  commercially reasonable efforts to make
available to each other, upon reasonable written request, their (and their
Affiliates') respective officers, directors, employees and agents for fact-
finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to  the extent that any
such individual may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions, in
which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the
conduct of the Business or the Retained Businesses prior to or after the 
Closing, other than Actions that are brought by one Party against the other
Party including any claims made under Article IX. Access to such Persons shall
be granted during normal business hours at a location and in a manner
reasonably calculated  to minimize disruption to such individuals, the Group
Companies and the Retained Companies, as applicable. Seller and Buyer agree to
reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorneys' fees, but excluding officers' or  employees' salaries or other
wages, incurred by any other Party in connection with providing individuals
and witnesses pursuant to this _Section _5.09.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions in Article VI shall govern
with  respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article
VI is in conflict with _Section _5.09. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party
shall have an obligation to cooperate, make available personnel or disclose
any documents or  other information pursuant to _Section _5.09, _Section
_5.10(b) or Article VI, if Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in
any Action and such  assistance, testimony, documents or other information is
reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ that, nothing in this _Section _5.09
shall limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with respect to
discovery or the production of  documents or other information in connection
with any such Action.

that exist as of the Closing and not to destroy or dispose of such copy for a
period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be

Buyer's request and at Buyer's expense.

Representatives to cooperate with and assist, Buyer and its Representatives,
in any audit or other preparation of financial statements by or on  behalf of
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) or the Business for
any period prior to the Closing (it being agreed that Buyer will reimburse
Seller for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses 
incurred by Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection with providing such
cooperation and assistance), and (C) use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the employees of the Retained Companies to cooperate with  Buyer and

the Party granting such access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may
withhold such access, as and to the extent necessary to avoid violation or
waiver, to any  document or information the disclosure of which could
reasonably be expected to violate any Contract or any Law or would result in
the waiver of any legal privilege  or work-product privilege; _provided_ that
such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such 
documents or information in a manner that does not result in the waiver of any
such privilege or violate such Contract or Law, including making reasonable
and  appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which these restrictions apply; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this
_Section _5.10(b) shall limit in any respect any rights any Party may have to
assert any legal privilege or work-product privilege or other defense with
respect to discovery or the production of documents or other information  in
connection with any litigation.

 

 

57  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related  matters to the extent any provision in Article
VI is in conflict with _Section _5.10(a) or _Section _5.10(b).

(d) Upon the completion of the French  Works Council Consultation Process,
Seller may elect, by sending notice to Buyer (the " _French Restructuring
Notice_ "), to execute the Preparatory  Business Transfers in respect of the
French Target, in which case the Preparatory Business Transfers in respect of
the French Target (including the French Seller's  transfer of French Target's
equity to the French Newco) shall be subject to the provisions of Article II
and the French Target will be deemed part of the Group Companies from and
after the date of the French Restructuring Notice.

Companies for any Straddle Tax Period, and (z) all Tax Returns  of the Group
Companies for any Tax periods beginning after the Closing Date. Each such Tax
Return that is Buyer's responsibility for a Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date or for a Straddle Tax Period (collectively, the " _Buyer-Filed
Tax Returns_ "), shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the most recent
past practices of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to such Tax 
Returns and without a change of any election or any accounting method, except,
in each case, as required by applicable Law.

 

(v) Each Party responsible for the preparation of an Income or other material
Tax Return under _Sections_ 6.01(a)(iii) and (iv) (other than Seller Combined
Tax Returns) shall submit such Tax Return to the other Party (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested by such other
Party, supporting documentation) at least  twenty-five (25) days prior to the
due date (including any applicable extension) therefor. The Parties shall
notify each other in writing if either objects to any items in any such draft
Tax Return within a reasonable amount of time after receipt  of such draft
Tax Return, and, if such draft Tax Return was provided to the Party at least
twenty (20) days prior to such due date, no less than fifteen (15) days prior
to such due date. Any such disputed item shall be resolved in good faith and 
in a manner mutually agreeable to both Parties, and if not so resolved by the
Parties, then may be submitted by any such Party to a jointly retained
accountant (which may be the same as or different from the Auditor retained
pursuant to _Section _2.05, if any). Upon resolution of all disputed items,
the relevant  Tax Return shall be adjusted or revised to reflect such
resolution and shall be binding upon the Parties without further adjustment.
The costs, fees and expenses of such accountant shall be borne equally by
Buyer (or its Affiliates) and Seller  (or its Subsidiaries). Except as
required by applicable Law, neither Party nor any of their Affiliates shall
amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Buyer-Filed Tax
Return without the prior written consent of the other Party.  Subject to each
Party's obligations under Article IX and reflecting any Taxes taken into
account in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, the  Party
responsible for the filing of a Tax Return shall remit or cause to be remitted
all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return.

 

 

70  

 

(b) Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid to, Seller any Tax Refund of  Pre-
Closing Income Taxes of any Group Company. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly claim and receive any such Tax Refunds to which
Seller would be entitled pursuant to this _Section  6.01(b)_ , including by
taking any action reasonably requested by Seller to obtain any such Tax
Refunds promptly, and shall pay any Tax Refunds, net of any Tax cost and
reasonable expenses incurred in  connection with obtaining such Tax Refund,
no later than ten (10) days following receipt thereof. Subject to _Section
6.03(d)_ , Buyer shall be entitled to  all other Tax Refunds in respect of
Taxes of the Group Companies (including to the extent such Tax Refund results
from the carryback of any Tax loss or other Tax attribute from a Post-Closing
Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period), and Seller  shall pay any such Tax
Refunds to Buyer, net of any Tax cost and reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining such Tax Refund; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
agrees to waive to the extent permitted by Applicable Law any carryback of any
Tax loss or other Tax attribute from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a  Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all excise,
sales, use, value added,  registration stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, and similar Taxes, levies,
charges and fees arising from the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ")  shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller and timely paid by
the Party required by Law to pay; _provided_ , _however_ , Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the Preparatory Business Transfers shall be borne
solely by Seller. In addition, the Party that is required to by Law shall
prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed with respect to such Transfer  Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Sections_ 6.01(a)(iii) and (iv), Seller shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, at its own expense, all Tax Returns
that  are required to be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the Preparatory Business Transfers. The Parties will
reasonably cooperate and provide such information as the other Party may
reasonably request from time to time in connection with the filing of all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes. If any value
added or similar Tax is or becomes chargeable  on any supply made by any
Seller to Buyer under this Agreement and Seller is required to account to the
relevant Taxing Authority for such Tax, Buyer must pay to Seller (in addition
to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such  supply)
an amount equal to the amount of such Tax (and Seller shall promptly provide
an appropriate invoice to Buyer).

 

(d) In the case of any Straddle Tax Period, (i) real, personal and intangible
property Taxes and any other  similar Taxes levied on a per diem basis of any
Person for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days during the  Straddle Tax Period that are in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Straddle Tax Period and (ii) any other Taxes of any Person for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such Tax  period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation
set forth in the previous sentence shall be made in a manner consistent with
the prior practice of Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

 

71  

Section 6.02 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
fully, and Buyer shall cause each of its Affiliates, including the Group
Companies, to cooperate fully,  as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the applicable other Party, in connection with the preparation, execution and
filing of Tax Returns and any Tax Claim. Such cooperation shall include access
to records and information which are  reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return or Tax Claim, making personnel available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder, executing Tax Returns and executing powers of  attorney. Buyer
shall cause its Affiliates, including the Group Companies, (i) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Group Companies
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the 
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods (including any extensions thereof), (ii) to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority and (iii) to give
Seller ninety (90)  days written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records. If Seller so requests, Buyer shall, and
Buyer shall cause its Affiliates, including the Group Companies, to, allow
Seller to take possession of such  books and records designated for
destruction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to transfer to Buyer any Tax Returns or other Tax
work papers of or including any of the Retained Companies to  the extent not
constituting Transferred Records. Any information obtained under this
_Section_ 6.02 shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise permitted to be
disclosed under _Section_ 5.11 or may be otherwise necessary in  connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting any
audit, examination or other proceeding. Buyer and Seller agree that the
sharing of information and cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ 6.02
shall be  done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Parties.

 

Section 6.03 Buyer Covenants. Buyer shall not cause or permit any Group
Company or any Affiliate of Buyer to (a) make any Tax election or deemed Tax
election that would be effective for any  Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) make
any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the purchase of the
Purchased Interests, (c) amend (i) any Income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or (ii) any Tax Return, other than an Income Tax  Return, for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period prior to the Tax Release Date, in each case, unless
required by applicable Law (and for which Buyer has given Seller at least
thirty (30) days written notice and explanation of the requirement to so file)
or  upon the prior written consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , any material
increase in the amount of any Tax Liability (or material decrease in the
amount of any Tax asset  or contra-liability) of Seller or its Subsidiaries
that is not compensated by Buyer shall be a reasonable basis for withholding
such consent), or (d) make any voluntary Tax filing with a non-U.S.
Governmental Authority with respect to the indirect  transfer of any of the
Group Companies pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 6.04 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax sharing, Tax
allocation or Tax indemnity agreements, except for this Agreement, between any
Group Company, on the one hand, and  any of the Retained Companies, on the
other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date to the extent they
relate to the Group Companies.

 

 

72  

Section 6.05 Tax Claims.

 

(a) If any Tax Claim shall be initiated, which, if successful, might result in
an indemnity payment under  Article IX or increase the amount of any Tax
Liability (or decrease the amount of any Tax asset or contra-liability)
included  in the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital, the
Indemnified Parties shall notify the Indemnifying Parties within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of notice of such a Tax Claim; _provided_ , that the failure
to give such  notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except (i) to the extent the Indemnifying Parties have actually been
prejudiced by such failure or (ii) if the Indemnified Parties fail to notify
the Indemnifying Parties of such claim  in accordance with this _Section
_6.05 prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

 

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating (i) to Income Taxes for a  Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (ii) otherwise to Taxes for which the Retained Companies
could reasonably be expected to be liable (including pursuant to Article IX or
any Taxes included in the calculation of  Closing Date Net Working Capital),
except as provided below, Seller shall have the right to control all
proceedings and make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel), and shall be the sole representative before
any Taxing Authority. Buyer shall execute all documents reasonably necessary
for Seller to control such Tax Claims, including Buyer or the Group Companies
granting to Seller a power of attorney  to take any action in the name of
Buyer or the Group Companies. Buyer shall control any Tax Claim that Seller is
entitled to, but does not choose to, control pursuant to this _Section
_6.05(b). Buyer shall control, at its own expense, all proceedings with
respect to any Tax Claim against the Group Companies with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period that is  not described in the first sentence of this
_Section _6.05(b). Except with respect to Tax Claims related to Seller
Combined Tax Returns, the Party  controlling such Tax Claim shall (A) notify
the other Party of significant developments with respect to such Tax Claim and
keep the other Party reasonably informed and consult with the other Party as
to the resolution of any issue that would  materially affect such other
Party, (B) give to the other party a copy of any Tax adjustment proposed in
writing with respect to such Tax Claim and copies of any other written
correspondence with the  relevant taxing authority relating to such Tax
Claim, (C) not settle or compromise any issue without the consent of such
other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and (D)
otherwise permit the other Party to participate in all aspects of such Tax
Claim, at such other Party's own expense.

_Section _6.05 and Article IX, the provisions of this _Section _6.05  shall
control.

 

Section 6.06 Post-Closing Payments. The parties agree that any (i) payment of
the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section _2.05(e) or (ii) indemnification
payment made  pursuant to Article IX shall be treated as an adjustment to the
portion of the Purchase Price attributable to the relevant Foreign Notes and
Subsidiary Interests and to treat such adjustments consistently therewith for
U.S. federal income and other  applicable Tax purposes, to the extent
permitted by Law.

 

 

73  

Article  VII 
  Employee Matters

 

Section 7.01 Employee Communications and Consultations. Except as expressly
contemplated by _Section_ 5.18, from and after the date hereof until the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith  regarding any
written communications to be distributed to any Business Employees relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or post-Closing terms of
employment, and Buyer and Seller shall each consult with the other and obtain
the  other's consent before distributing any communications to any Business
Employees, works councils, unions or other labor representatives. In addition,
each of Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and provide such
information as the other may  reasonably request from time to time in
connection with any information and consultations processes relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Business Employees or any
works council, union or other labor representative.

 

Section 7.02 Effect of Transfer. Seller shall use its reasonable good faith
efforts as part of the Preparatory Business Transfers such that on or prior to
the Closing Date each Business Employee will be employed by a  Group Company,
and Seller shall promptly inform Buyer if Seller has knowledge that fewer than
all Business Employees will be so employed by the Group Companies. To the
extent that Seller needs to transfer the employment of a Business Employee to
a  Group Company, Seller and Buyer agree that Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts so that such transfer will occur in a manner that will not
constitute a separation, termination or severance of employment of any
Business Employee prior to  or upon the occurrence of such transfer, and that
such employee will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately
before and immediately after such transfer. Seller shall bear all the
Liabilities and obligations relating to, and shall  indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and the Group Companies from and against, any claims made by
any Business Employee for any statutory or common law severance, gratuity or
other separation benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation 
benefits and any other legally mandated payment obligations (including any
compensation payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any
payments pursuant to a judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the
Parties) and for any other  claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether
related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of
or in connection with (i) the transfer or termination of employment of any
Business Employee with the Group Companies in  connection with the
Preparatory Business Transfers; (ii) the failure of Buyer or its Affiliates to
continue the employment of any Business Employee or any other individual who
is entitled to automatically transfer to a Group Company, Buyer or its 
Affiliates pursuant to the Preparatory Business Transfers; or (iii) otherwise
arising or incurred in connection with the Internal Restructuring. Buyer shall
also bear all the Liabilities and obligations relating to, and shall indemnify
and hold  harmless the Retained Companies from and against any claims
relating to the employment of any Business Employee after the Closing,
including in respect of any act or omission relating to the employment of any
Business Employee or termination of  employment after the Closing.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if there is
any Business Employee receiving short-term disability benefits under any
Seller Plan who would lose such benefits as a result of the Internal 
Restructuring or the Closing or who would cease to be eligible for long-term
disability benefits under a Seller Plan as a result of the Internal
Restructuring or the Closing, then the employment of such Business Employee
shall be retained by Seller  or a Retained Company following the Closing
until such Business Employee is cleared to return to work, at which time Buyer
or a Group Company shall commence to employ such Business Employee; _provided_
that such return to work occurs within  six (6) months of the Closing Date
(or such longer period required under applicable Law).

 

 

74  

Section 7.03 Continuation  of Benefits. With respect to each Business
Employee, following the Closing until the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the
Closing Date or such longer period required by Law (such period, the "
_Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Buyer  shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to (and shall cause any other Person providing compensation and
benefits on their behalf to): (a) provide to such Business Employee no less
favorable base salary, wage rates and cash target short-term incentive 
opportunities (excluding equity and transaction-related incentives), as
applicable, than the base salary, wage rates and cash target short-term
incentive opportunities (excluding equity and transaction-related incentives)
provided by Seller and its  Subsidiaries (or any other Person providing
compensation and benefits on their behalf) immediately prior to the Closing;
and (b) maintain employee benefits under plans, programs and arrangements that
will provide benefits to such Business Employee  that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided by Seller and its
Subsidiaries (or any other Person providing compensation or benefits on their
behalf) immediately prior to the Closing (excluding any defined benefit 
pension, deferred compensation, or retiree medical or transaction-related
benefits (other than those assumed under _Sections 7.04_ and _7.05_ )).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be
construed as  (i) limiting the obligations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
under Law or any Collective Bargaining Agreement, or as necessary to preclude
claims from Business Employees for severance, notice, termination pay or other
economic compensation, to  maintain the terms, conditions and employee
benefits of any Business Employees for any period of time, or (ii) requiring
either Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any
Business Employee for any period after the Closing  Date; _provided_ that any
such employee terminated during the Benefits Continuation Period shall receive
from Buyer the severance benefits set forth in _Section _7.05 if such
termination qualifies such Business Employee therefor.

 


 

 

Section 7.04 Assumed Retention and Incentive Payments. As of the Closing,
Buyer or the Group Companies shall assume and honor, or Buyer shall cause its
Affiliates to assume and honor, in accordance with their terms, the

Agreements" on _Schedule_ 3.17(a) and (b) bonus amounts up to $2.3 million in
the  aggregate under each cash incentive plan maintained by Seller or its
Subsidiaries for Business Employees for (x) all completed performance periods
for which such bonuses have been earned and not yet paid and (y) for the
interim period commencing at  the end of the most recently completed
performance period and ending immediately prior to Closing for which such
bonuses have been earned in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and not yet paid (the " _Assumed Incentive  Payments_ "). Such
Assumed Incentive Payments shall be determined in accordance with the terms of
the applicable plan or agreement, and Buyer shall or shall cause its
Affiliates to pay such Assumed Incentive Payments in accordance with the 
terms of the applicable plan or agreement to the extent that the Business
Employees thereunder shall otherwise become eligible to receive payment of
such bonus amounts under the terms of the applicable plan or agreement.

 

 

75  

Section 7.05 Severance Benefits. With respect to each Business Employee
terminated during the Benefits Continuation Period and whose termination
qualifies therefor, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide 
severance or termination benefits to each such Business Employee that are no
less favorable than those severance or termination benefits applicable to each
such Business Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date under the
severance plan  identified in _Schedule_ 7.05, subject to the terms thereof.

 

Section 7.06 Service Credit. With respect to each Business Employee, effective
from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,

termination benefits and vacation accrual) under all plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the
benefit of such  Business Employees, service with the Seller and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing to the extent such service was recognized
under the corresponding Seller Plan covering such Business Employee, in each
case, except where it would result in a  duplication of benefits, (b) waive
any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting
period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans established
or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit  of the Business
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Group Company Plan covering such Business Employee and (c)
provide  full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments
made or incurred by a Business Employees under a corresponding Seller Plan
covering such Business Employee prior to the Closing for the plan year in
which the Closing occurs. As a  condition to Buyer's obligations under
clauses (b) and (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, and to the extent
not already in the possession of the Group Companies, Seller shall cause such
information reasonably requested by such clauses to be  provided to Buyer in
a manner reasonably requested by the Buyer within ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing.

 

Section 7.07 Work Authorization. If any Business Employee requires a work
permit, employment pass, visa or other legal or regulatory approval for his or
her employment with Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer and Seller  shall, and
each shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass, visa or other approval to
be obtained and in effect prior to the Closing.

 

Section 7.08 Vacation. As of the Closing Date and unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, Buyer shall assume all liabilities associated with accrued
vacation and paid time off balances of any Business Employees and  shall
credit and honor, in accordance with the terms of the applicable policy of
Seller or its applicable Subsidiaries, all vacation days and other paid time
off accrued but not yet taken by the Business Employees.

 

 

76  

Section 7.09 Health and Welfare Benefits. Other than with respect to any Group
Company Plan, Seller shall, or shall cause the Retained Companies to, bear all
the Liabilities and obligations relating to, and shall  indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and the Group Companies from and against, all (a) medical,
vision, dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any
Business Employee or his or her dependents and former employees of the Group 
Companies (including COBRA continuation coverage where the qualifying event
occurred prior to the Closing), (b) claims for short-term and long-term
disability income benefits incurred by any Business Employee and (c) claims

any Business Employee or his or her dependents, (ii) claims for short-term and
long-term disability income benefits incurred by  any Business Employee and
(iii) claims for group life, travel and accident and accidental death and
dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Business Employee, in each

vision, dental or prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses),
upon provision  of the services, materials or supplies comprising any such
benefits and (y) short- and long-term disability, life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death,
illness, injury or accident  giving rise to such benefits.

 

Section 7.10 Workers' Compensation. Other than with respect to any Group
Company Plan, the Retained Companies shall be responsible for all claims for
workers compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the Closing  by any
Business Employee to the extent such claims are covered under a workers'

Companies. Without limiting any obligations under any Group Company Plan,
Buyer and its  Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the Closing by any
Business Employee. A claim for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed
to be incurred when the event giving rise  to the claim (the " _Workers
Compensation Event_ ") occurs. If the Workers Compensation Event occurs over a
period both preceding and following the Closing, the claim shall be the joint
responsibility and liability of Seller and Buyer and shall  be equitably
apportioned between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, based
upon the relative periods of time that the Workers Compensation Event
transpired preceding and following the Closing.

 

Section 7.11 Group Company Benefit Plans; Seller Retention of Seller Plan
Liabilities. No later than the Closing Date, the Group Companies shall
establish or cause to be established (including through the Transition 
Services Agreement), all retirement, pension, employee welfare and employee
benefit plans for Business Employees as are necessary to comply with its
obligations pursuant to this Article VII (each, a " _Buyer Plan_ "). Buyer
shall indemnify and  hold harmless the Retained Companies from any
Liabilities, obligations, commitments incurred by any of the Retained
Companies relating to any Group Company Plan or any delay in establishing any
such Buyer Plan. Unless otherwise provided in the  Transition Services
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, each Business Employee shall cease to
participate in any Seller Plan (other than any Group Company Plan) as an
active employee. In addition to the foregoing, except as otherwise provided 
in the Transition Services Agreement, effective as of the Closing, the Group
Companies shall cease to participate in any Seller Plan and, except as
expressly set forth in _Sections_ 7.03, 7.04, 7.08, 7.09, 7.10, 7.12 and 7.13,

who participate in Seller's 401(k) Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ "). 
Following the Closing Date, Business Employees may elect to rollover their
account balances in the Seller 401(k) Plan, including any promissory notes
evidencing any loans to such participant, to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, and Buyer
401(k) Plan will  accept such rollovers including participant loans. Buyer
will cooperate with Seller in effecting a transition of all outstanding 401(k)
loans of Business Employees in a manner designed to prevent a deemed
distribution from the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

Section 7.13 FSA Transfer. As of the Closing Date, the Group Companies shall
have established or maintained a flexible spending account plan for  medical
and dependent care expenses (" _Buyer 's FSA_") for each Business Employee who

in Buyer's FSA and shall honor and continue, through the end of the plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs, the elections made by each such Business
Employee under the Seller FSA in respect of such flexible spending accounts
that are in effect  immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer or one of
its Affiliates shall credit or debit, as applicable, effective as of the
Closing Date, the applicable account of each Business Employee under Buyer's
FSA with an amount equal to the balance of  each such Business Employee's
account under the Seller FSA as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. To
the extent that Buyer and Seller mutually agree that it would be practicable
and material to do so, then as soon as practicable after the  Closing Date,
Seller shall pay to Buyer or one of its Affiliates the net aggregate amount of
the account balances credited under Buyer's FSA, if such amount is positive,
and Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall pay to Seller the net aggregate 
amount of the account balances credited under Buyer's FSA, if such amount is
negative. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims by the Business
Employees under the Seller  FSA incurred at any time during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs, whether incurred prior to, on or after such
date, that have not been paid in full as of such date. For purposes of this
_Section_ 7.13, a claim for  reimbursement shall be deemed to have been
incurred on the date on which the charge or expense giving rise to such claim
is incurred.

 

Section 7.14 Third-Party Rights. The provisions contained in this Agreement
with respect to any Business Employee are included for the sole benefit of the
Parties and shall not create any right in any other Person,  including any
Business Employee (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the foregoing).
Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment to or creation of any plan
providing benefits to any Business Employee or shall be deemed to prohibit or
restrict  Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of
any Business Employee following the Closing; _provided_ that any such employee
terminated during the Benefits Continuation Period shall receive from Buyer
the severance  benefits set forth in _Section _7.05.

of an earlier specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of such
date), (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article
III of this Agreement (other than the  Fundamental Representations and
_Section_ 3.07(b) (Absence of Certain Changes)), without giving effect to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications, shall be true
and correct as  of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing as if made at
and as of the Closing (other than such representations and warranties that by
their terms address matters only as of an earlier specified date, which shall
be true and correct only as of  such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties described in this clause (ii) to be so true and
correct would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the  representations and warranties of
Seller contained in _Section_ 3.07(b) (Absence of Certain Changes) shall be
true and correct in all respect as of the date hereof and at and as of the
Closing as if  made at and as of the Closing; and (iv) the Fundamental
Representations of Seller contained in the _Section_ 3.05 (Group Companies)
shall be true and correct in all respects (other than de minimis  exceptions)
as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing as if made at and as of the
Closing (other than such representations and warranties that by their terms
address matters only as of an earlier specified date, which shall be true
and  correct only as of such date);

 

 

79  

(c) since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred a Material
Adverse Effect;

 

(d) Seller shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate signed by  an
executive officer of Seller, on behalf of Seller and not in such officer's
personal capacity, that the conditions set forth in _Sections_ 8.02(a),
8.02(b) and 8.02(c) have been satisfied;

 

(e) Seller shall have delivered to Buyer the French  Restructuring Notice;
and

 

(f) Seller shall have completed the Preparatory  Business Transfers, except
where such failure to complete such actions would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the CrossControl, Elliott Manufacturing, Gits Manufacturing
Company, Maximatecc, Power-Packer or Weasler brands individually  or the
Business as a whole.

 

Section 8.03 Conditions to the Obligations of Seller. The obligations of
Seller to consummate, or cause to be consummated, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are  also subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived in writing by
Seller:

 

(a) Buyer shall have performed, in all material respects, all of its
obligations hereunder required to be  performed by it at or prior to the
Closing;

 

(b) the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in Article IV of
this Agreement, without giving  effect to materiality or similar
qualifications, shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and at and as
of the Closing as if made at and as of the Closing (other than such
representations and warranties that by their terms address matters  only as
of an earlier specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of such
date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct would not reasonably be expected to interfere with,
prevent or  delay the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

 

(c) Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a certificate signed  by an officer
of Buyer, and not in such officer's personal capacity, that the conditions set
forth in _Sections_ 8.03(a) and 8.03(b) have been satisfied.

the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ 8.01, _Section_ 8.02 or
_Section_ 8.03 to be satisfied  if such failure was caused by the failure of
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, respectively, to (a) use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) otherwise comply with  their obligations under this
Agreement in all material respects.

Section 9.01 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is
twelve (12) months after the  Closing Date; _provided_ that, the Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties contained in _Sections_
4.01 (Existence and Power), 4.02 (Authorization)  and 4.09 (Finders' Fees)

been validly delivered to the Party against whom such indemnity may be sought
prior to the applicable Survival Expiration  Date in accordance with _Section
_9.03. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim that
any Party may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Survival Expiration Dates  set forth and agreed
to in this _Section _9.01 shall govern when any such claim may be brought and
shall replace and supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be
applicable.

 

Section 9.02 Indemnification.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, effective at and after the
Closing, Seller shall  indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective equityholders, Affiliates and Representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by any Buyer  Indemnitee to the extent arising
from or relating to: 
 

 

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this

pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(iii) any Retained Liability or other Liability of the Buyer Indemnitees

of such Group Company being included in any consolidated, affiliated, combined
or unitary group at any time on or before the Closing  Date, and any Tax
(other than a Transfer Tax) attributable to Seller's gains arising from the
transfer of a Group Company pursuant to this Agreement;

 

 

81  

(vi) any Tax Liability attributable to the Preparatory Business Transfers; or

 

(vii) the matters disclosed as Items #2-4 on _Schedule  3.10_ ;

 

 

_provided_ that, (A) with respect to indemnification by Seller pursuant to
_Section _9.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations
and the representations and warranties contained in  Section 3.20 (Taxes)),
Seller shall not be liable for any breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller (1) attributable to a single claim or all claims arising from the same
or substantially related  facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of
Damages (excluding costs and expenses of the Buyer Indemnitees incurred in
connection with making such claim under this Agreement) incurred or paid by
the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach exceeds  $40,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_
") and, if such Damages do not exceed the Mini-Basket, then such Damages shall
not be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of Damages under the following clause (2); and (2)  unless the
aggregate amount of Damages incurred or paid by the Buyer Indemnitees for all
such breaches exceeds $1,057,500.00, and then only to the extent such
aggregate Damages exceed such amount, (B) in no event shall Seller's aggregate
Liability  arising out of or relating to _Section _9.02(a)(i) exceed
$1,057,500.00 and (C) in no event shall Seller's aggregate Liability arising
out of or relating to _Section _9.02(a)(ii) (excluding any Liability arising
out of a breach of the  covenants contained in _Section _5.13(c)) exceed the
Purchase Price.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, effective at and after the
Closing, the Retained Companies and their respective equityholders or
Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") shall be entitled
to indemnification from Buyer for any and all Damages incurred or suffered
by  any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising from or relating to:

have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee for any Damages to  the
extent arising from or related to: (i) any change in any Environmental Law or
new remedial or corrective action standard adopted or imposed after the
Closing Date, or from any changes in land use, cessation of operations, or
site closures after  the Closing Date (in each case, with respect to breaches
of representations and warranties only); (ii) any remedial action beyond what
is ordered, directed or otherwise required by a Governmental Authority; or
(iii) any voluntary environmental  sampling or subsurface investigation
conducted by any of the Group Companies or voluntary reporting of any
information by any of the Group Companies to any third party (including a
Governmental Authority) after the Closing Date with respect to 
environmental, health or safety conditions at the Real Property. Furthermore,
neither Buyer nor Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, undertake any investigation at any Real Property after the Closing
Date that would  involve subsurface sampling unless such investigation is (A)
necessary to comply with requirements of applicable Environmental Law or any
Permit; (B) ordered, directed or otherwise required by any Governmental
Authority; or (C) required by the  landlord under any Lease.

 

Section 9.03 Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall
only be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming indemnification under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnified  Party_ ") with respect to any claim
asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_
") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under _Section
_9.02 shall (i) promptly (but no later  than twenty (20) days after receiving
notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party
a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") stating  the nature, basis, the
amount thereof (to the extent known or estimated, which amount shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim), the method of
computation thereof (to the extent known or estimated), any other remedy 
sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto, and, to the
extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto, along with
copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim (subject to
preservation  of any privilege or work-product doctrine) and the basis for
indemnification sought. Failure to notify the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with this _Section _9.03(a) will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
Liability that it may have  to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent
(1) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's
failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the
Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim  in accordance with this
_Section _9.03(a) prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date. The
Parties will act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling
or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims.

 

 

83  

(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect within twenty (20) days after receiving a
Claim Notice to assume and  thereafter conduct the defense of any Third Party
Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice, and each Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such defense by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,  the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , if the Indemnified Party
shall have determined in good faith in consultation with  outside counsel
that (i) an actual or likely conflict of interest makes representation of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel
inappropriate, or (ii) there are or likely to be available to the Indemnified
Party one  or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one
or more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
engage separate counsel, and  the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will
not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
compromise with respect to such Third Party Claim  without the Indemnified
Party's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement (A) provide for a complete
and unconditional release of the claims that are the subject of such  Third
Party Claim in favor of the Indemnified Party and (B) do not impose relief
other than the payment of monetary damages for which the Indemnifying Party
has acknowledged responsibility under this Article IX. If the Indemnifying
Party (1) does  not, within twenty (20) days after such notice is given, give
notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim or (2) elects to assume the defense but thereafter fails to
promptly assume such defense,  then the Indemnified Party may conduct the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the
Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to  such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing is a Damage subject to this
Article IX without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and  (y) notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges in writing that such Third Party Claim results in Damages that
are fully indemnifiable without limitation under this Article IX, the 
Indemnifying Party may thereafter assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Article VI and not this _Section
_9.03(b) shall govern the conduct of any Tax Claim.

 

(c) If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstances that may give
rise to a claim for  indemnification pursuant to _Section _9.02 for any
matter not involving a Third Party Claim, then such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (i) notify the Indemnifying Party and (ii) deliver to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice describing  in reasonable detail the
nature of the claim, describing in reasonable detail the basis of the
Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under this Agreement and
including the Indemnified Party's best estimate of the amount of Damages
that  may arise from such claim. Failure to notify the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this _Section _9.03(c) will not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the
extent (A) the  Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice or (B) the Indemnified Party
fails to notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim in accordance with this
_Section _9.03(c) prior to the  applicable Survival Expiration Date.

 

(d) At the reasonable request of the  Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified
Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives all
reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters  to which
the applicable indemnification claim relates. All such access shall be granted
during normal business hours and shall be granted under conditions which shall
not unreasonably interfere with the  business and operations of such
Indemnified Party and in a manner to preserve any privilege or work-product
doctrine and comply with confidentiality obligations to  third parties (
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and direct its and their Representatives to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to provide  such access and documents in a manner that preserves such
privilege or doctrine and complies with such confidentiality obligations,
including making reasonable and appropriate substitute access and disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in  which such restrictions apply).

 

 

84  

Section 9.04 Calculation of Damages; Other Indemnification Limitations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein:

 

(a) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent a
Liability or reserve relating  to the matter giving rise to such
indemnification has been specifically included in the final determination of
Closing Date Net Working Capital or Closing Date Indebtedness;

 

(b) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for Damages with
respect to (i) Taxes that  arise from any breach of a covenant or agreement
made or to be performed by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, from and after
the Closing, the Group Companies) pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) Taxes that
arise from any action taken by Buyer or its  Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Group Companies) on or after the Closing Date following
the Closing outside the ordinary course of business, (iii) the amount of any
net operating loss, Tax basis, Tax credit or other Tax  attribute (or the
loss, unavailability or reduction thereof), except to the extent resulting
directly in additional cash Tax liability of the Group Companies for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period that otherwise would not have been imposed or (iv) any 
Transfer Taxes allocated to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.01(c);

 

(c) (i) each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Damages for  which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but
not the obligation, and shall be afforded the opportunity by the Indemnified
Party to the extent reasonably possible, to  take all available steps to
minimize Damages for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification before such Damages actually are incurred by the Indemnified
Party;

 

(d) the amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement  shall be reduced by (i) any available
insurance proceeds with respect to such Damages (including under the RandW
Insurance Policy) actually received and (ii) all available Tax benefits
actually realized by the Indemnified Party in the year, and  the following
year, in which the Indemnified Party received a payment from an Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Damages and determined on a "with and without"
basis after use of all Tax deductions, losses and other attributes and (iii)
all  other amounts actually recovered from a third party pursuant to
indemnification or otherwise in respect of such Damages, in each case, net of
out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that if  an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a
third party in respect of Damages that are the subject of indemnification
hereunder after all or a portion of such Damages have been paid by an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX, then the  Indemnified Party
shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (A) (1)
the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Damages plus (2)
the amount received by the Indemnified Party in respect thereof (net of  out-
of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining such recovery)
over (B) the full amount of the Damages;

 

 

85  

(e) no Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section_
9.02(a)(i), _Section_ 9.02(a)(ii), _Section_ 9.02(b)(i) or _Section_
9.02(b)(ii), to sue for, or to assert any other right or remedy with respect
to, any  Damages, causes of action or other claims to the extent they are
Damages, causes of action or claims with respect to which such Indemnified
Party has taken action (or caused action to be taken) to accelerate the time
period in which such matter is  asserted or payable;

 

(f) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of
determining whether there is an  inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty and calculating the amount of Damages for purposes
of this Article IX with respect to an inaccuracy in or a breach thereof (other
than with respect to the representations and warranties in _Section _ 3.07(b)
(Absence of Certain Changes) and _Section_ 3.09(a) (Material Contracts)), no
materiality standards or qualifications or qualifications by reference  to
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases in such representation or
warranty shall be taken into account or given any effect; and

 

(g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein  (unless actually awarded
and paid on account of a Third Party Claim), no Party shall be liable for any
(i) punitive, or exemplary damages or (ii) damages that are not reasonably
foreseeable.

 

Section 9.05 Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to
claims based on Fraud solely in respect of any representation or warranty
expressly given in this  Agreement, claims for injunctive or equitable
remedies, claims under _Section_ 7.11 and claims under the RandW Insurance
Policy, following the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
will be the sole and exclusive remedy of  the Parties and any Person claiming
by or through any party (including the Indemnified Parties) related to or
arising from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement and  neither Buyer nor
Seller will have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of
this Agreement or any other liability arising out of the negotiation, entry
into or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise.
All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual
in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth in
this Article IX.  Nothing in this _Section _9.05 shall limit a party's right
to bring a claim for Fraud in respect of any representation or warranty
expressly given in this Agreement. Furthermore, Buyer and Seller acknowledge
and agree that, except in the case  of Fraud solely in respect of any
representation or warranty expressly given in this Agreement:

 

 

(a) the parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this
Agreement and hereby waive any statutory and common law remedies, with respect
to matters; and

 

(b) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this Article IX
were specifically bargained for between the Parties and were taken into
account by the Parties in arriving at the Purchase Price.

 

 

86  

 

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section _2.05  shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes
of this _Section _9.05 and shall not be limited by the terms of this _Section
_9.05.

 

Article  X

Section 10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by written notice from either Party  to the other Party, if (i) any
Governmental Authority set forth in _Schedule_ 5.03(b) or (ii) any other
Governmental Authority not acting pursuant  to Competition Laws and, in each
case, having competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order,
judgment, decree, ruling or injunction (other than a temporary restraining
order) or taken any other  Action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

Party whose failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement has
been the primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, such order, decree,
ruling, injunction or other Action;

 

(c) by written notice from Buyer to Seller, if there is a  material breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in Article III hereof or any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or performed by Seller pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, in each case, that would cause the failure of a  condition
set forth in _Section_ 8.01 or _Section _8.02 to be satisfied at the Closing;
_provided_ that, in each case under this _clause_ (c), Buyer may not terminate
this Agreement unless (i) (A) Buyer has given written  notice of such
material breach to Seller and Seller has not substantially cured such breach
by the earlier of thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice and the
Outside Date or (B) such breach is not  capable of being cured and (ii) Buyer
is not then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 

(d) by written notice from Seller to Buyer, if there is a  material breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in Article IV hereof or any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms

set forth in _Section_ 8.01 or _Section_ 8.03 to be satisfied at the Closing;
_provided_ that, in each case under this _clause (d)_ , Seller may not
terminate this Agreement unless (i) (A) Seller has given written notice of

warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 

(e) by written notice from either Buyer to Seller or Seller to Buyer, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2019 (the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , that this right of termination shall not be available
to any Party whose  failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement primarily resulted in the failure of the conditions provided in
_Sections_ 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 as applicable, to be satisfied before such
date; or

 

 

87  

(f) by written notice from Seller to Buyer, if (i) all of the  conditions set
forth in _Section _8.01, _Section _8.02 and _Section_ 8.03 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, (ii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that
Seller is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (iii) Buyer
fails to consummate the Closing within two (2) Business Days following the
first date the Closing should have  occurred pursuant to _Section _2.04(a).

 

Section 10.02 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section_ 10.02 or _Section_ 10.03, in the event of the termination of this
Agreement  pursuant to _Section_ 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any Liability on the part of any Party or its
Affiliates, Representatives or stockholders, other than Liability of Seller or
Buyer, as the  case may be, for any Willful Breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination. The provisions of _Section_ 5.12, Section
5.19(f), this _Section_ 10.02, _Section_ 10.03, Article XI and the
Confidentiality Agreement  shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.03 Termination Fee.

 

(a) In the event that Seller terminates  this Agreement pursuant to (i)
_Section_ 10.01(d) or _Section_ 10.01(f) or (ii) _Section_ 10.01(e), and at
the time of, or prior to, such termination Seller would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant  to _Section_ 10.01(d) or _Section_
10.01(f), Buyer shall  promptly and in any event within two (2) Business Days
of such termination, pay Seller a non-refundable termination fee, without
offset or reduction of any kind, in an amount of $12,690,000 (the "
_Termination  Fee_ "). Any Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section_
10.03(a) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one
or more accounts specified by Seller in writing to Buyer.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, in the event
that the Termination Fee is paid pursuant to _Section_ 10.03(a) _,_ Buyer
shall not have any liability of any nature whatsoever to Seller with respect
to any breach of this Agreement or the failure of the Closing  to occur,
other than the liability of Buyer to pay (i) the Termination Fee in accordance
with _Section_ 10.03(a) and (ii) any amounts payable under Section 5.19(f);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer fails to pay the  Termination Fee when
due as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, (A) Buyer shall additionally pay to Seller interest on the
amount of the Termination Fee from the date such judgment was entered until 
the date of payment at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum and (B) if, in
order to obtain such payment, Seller commences an Action in a venue permitted
by _Section 11.06_ that results in a judgment against Buyer, Buyer shall
reimburse  Seller for its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Action to the
extent awarded in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in
such Action; _provided_ ,  that, if Buyer prevails in such Action or such
court otherwise enters a final judgment that the Termination Fee was not due
and payable by Buyer, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'  fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such Action to the extent awarded in a final judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction in such Action. Seller and Buyer acknowledge
and agree that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather  is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in  reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount
would otherwise be uncertain and incapable of accurate determination.

 

 

88  

(c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the  agreements contained in
_Section_ 10.02 and _Section_ 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
Buyer nor Seller would enter into this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, other than _Section_ 11.13, the right to
terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Termination Fee (plus any
interest thereon and any losses or damages payable pursuant to  Section
5.19(f)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer, the
Debt Financing Sources, the Guarantor or any of their respective former,
current or future stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates
or  Representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Related Parties_ ") for all
losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder  or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Buyer Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any Willful Breach of  this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Buyer
Related Parties shall have any further liability or  obligation relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including as may arise out of the Commitment Letters).

 

(d) Other than seeking to terminate this  Agreement and receive payment of
the Termination Fee, plus any interest thereon and any indemnification for any
losses or damages payable pursuant to Section 5.19(f), none of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or Representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller  Related Parties_ ") shall seek to recover any
other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law  or
in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or
damages suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated  hereby or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith. In no event shall Buyer be subject to (nor shall any
Seller Related Party seek to recover) monetary damages in excess  of an
amount equal to the Termination Fee (plus any interest thereon and any losses
or damages payable pursuant to Section 5.19(f)), in the aggregate, for any 
losses or other liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches by
Buyer of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in  this Agreement (whether willful, intentional, unilateral or otherwise,
including Willful Breach) or arising from any claim or cause of action that
any Buyer Related Party may have hereunder, including  for a breach of
_Section_ 2.04(a) as a result of the Debt Financing not being available to be
drawn down or otherwise arising from the Debt Commitment  Letter or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith.

91  

(a) The Parties hereby consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the  State of Delaware or, to the extent such court
declines jurisdiction, first to any federal court, or second, to any state
court, each located in Wilmington, Delaware, and hereby waive the right to

jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY  JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION BASED UPON,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING (OR AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND EACH OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS  AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION_ 11.06(b).

 

Section 11.07 Rights of Third Parties. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person,
other than the Parties,  any right or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the past, present and future
directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
stockholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys,  advisors and other

and Seller Indemnitees shall be intended third party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, Article IX and (c) Prior Counsel and the Designated Persons shall be

92  

Section 11.09 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified, in whole
or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the
same manner (but not  necessarily by the same individuals) as this Agreement
and which makes reference to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 11.09 to the contrary, to the extent any amendment or modification to
Section 10.03 _(c)_ , Section  11.05, _Section_ 11.06, Section 11.07, this
Section 11.09 or _Section_ 11.14 (and any provision or definition of this
Agreement to the extent an amendment or modification of such provision or
definition would modify the substance of  the aforelisted Sections) is sought
which is adverse to the rights of the Debt Financing Sources, the prior
written consent of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter shall be required
before such amendment or modification is rendered effective.

 

Section 11.10 Bulk Sales Laws. Buyer hereby waives any rights against Seller
and its Subsidiaries with respect to non-compliance by Seller or its
Subsidiaries with the provisions  of the "bulk sales", "bulk transfer" or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the Preparatory Business
Transfers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 11.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary  to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held  invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
Parties.

 

Section 11.12 Disclosure Schedules. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the inclusion of any item, information or other matter in the Disclosure
Schedules that is not  required by this Agreement to be so included is solely
for the convenience of Buyer, (b) the disclosure by Seller of any item,
information or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgement by Seller  that such item, information or other
matter is material, (c) if any section of the Disclosure Schedules lists an
item or information in such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure
required by or provided in another section of the  Disclosure Schedules or
Article III reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, such item or
information shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such
other section, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate  cross-
reference to such other section or the omission of a reference in the
particular representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure
Schedules, (d) except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been
inserted in the  Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, and
(e) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and statements contained
therein are not intended to broaden or constitute, and shall not be construed
as broadening or constituting,  representations, warranties or covenants of
Seller except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement.

 

Section 11.13 Enforcement.

 

 

93  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would  occur, and that the
Parties would not have an adequate remedy at Law, in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, 
except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ 11.13, the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or anticipated
breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this  Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise,
in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at Law or in
equity. Each Party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such  remedy. The Parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

 

(b) The remedies available to Seller pursuant to this _Section _ 11.13 shall
be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in
equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall
not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Seller from, in the alternative,
seeking  to terminate this Agreement and collect the Termination Fee under
_Section_ 10.03. For the avoidance of doubt, although Seller may pursue both a
grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by this _Section_ 11.13
and the  payment of the Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall Seller
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to
require Buyer to consummate the Closing and payment of the Termination Fee.

 

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, the  Parties hereby further acknowledge
and agree that prior to the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance of Buyer's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
and to cause  Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including to effect the Closing in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if (i) all conditions in
_Section _ 8.01, _Section_ 8.02 and _Section_ 8.03 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, (ii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing within two
Business Days following the date the Closing is  required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section_ 2.04(a), and (iii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed that
if specific performance is granted and the Equity  Financing is funded, then
the Closing will occur.

 

Section 11.14 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties (together
with any assignee of Buyer pursuant to _Section _11.04) and then only with
respect to the specific obligations  set forth herein with respect to such
named Party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or other Representative of any Party, or Affiliate of any of  the
foregoing (excluding Seller and Buyer), shall have any Liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
Liabilities of Seller or  Buyer under this Agreement (whether for
indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any claim based on, arising out of
or related to this Agreement (including the Debt Financing).

 

Section 11.15 Privileged Matters; Conflicts of Interest.

 

 

94  

(a) The Parties agree that their  respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert or waive any attorney-client and work product
privileges belonging to the other Parties with respect to the Group Companies
and the Retained Businesses (collectively, " _Privileges_ ") shall be governed
by the provisions of this _Section _11.15(a).  With respect to matters
relating to the Retained Businesses or the Retained Assets, and with respect
to all Transferred Records, documents or communications (collectively, "
_Information_ ") of any of the Retained Companies prepared in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller
shall have sole authority to  determine whether to assert or waive any
Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege against Buyer and its
Affiliates. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Group Companies) not to, take  any action without the prior
written consent of Seller that would reasonably be expected to result in any
waiver of any such Privileges of Seller. After the Closing, Buyer shall have
sole authority to  determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with
respect to matters relating to the Group Companies (except for the Information
prepared in connection with the Transaction Documents or the  transactions
contemplated thereby). However, Buyer may not assert any such Privileges of
Buyer related to pre-Closing advice or communications relating to the Group
Companies against the Retained  Companies. Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, take any action after the Closing without the prior
written consent of Buyer that would reasonably be expected to result in any 
waiver of any such Privileges of Buyer. The rights and obligations created by
this _Section _11.15 shall apply to all Information as to which the Retained 
Companies or the Group Companies would be entitled to assert or has asserted a
Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Privileged  Information_ "). Upon
receipt by the Retained Companies, or Buyer or its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Group Companies), as the case may be, of any subpoena,
discovery or other request  from any third party that actually or arguably
calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of another
Party or if the Retained Companies or Buyer or its Affiliates (including,
after  the Closing, the Group Companies), as the case may be, obtains
knowledge that any current or former employee of the Retained Companies or the
Group Companies has received any subpoena, discovery or other request from any
third party that actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure
of Privileged Information of the other Party, such Party shall promptly notify
the other of the existence of the request and shall provide the  other Party
a reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to assert any rights it
may have under this _Section _11.15 or otherwise to prevent the  production
or disclosure of Privileged Information. Seller's transfer of any Transferred
Records or other Information to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and
Seller's agreement to permit Buyer to obtain Information existing prior to the
Closing are made in reliance on the Parties' respective agreements, as set 
forth in _Section _5.11 and this _Section _11.15, to maintain the 
confidentiality of such Information and to take the steps provided herein for
the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or be asserted by Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be. The access to Transferred  Records and other
Information being granted pursuant to _Sections_ 5.02, 5.09, 5.10 and 9.03 and
Article VI, the agreement to provide witnesses and individuals pursuant to
_Section_ 5.09 and the disclosure to Buyer and Seller of Privileged
Information relating to the Group Companies or the Retained Businesses
pursuant to this Agreement in  connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall not be asserted by Seller or Buyer to constitute, or
otherwise be deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or may be
asserted under this _Section _11.15 or otherwise.

 

 

95  

(b) _Conflicts of Interest_. Buyer hereby waives  and agrees not to assert,
and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to waive and not
assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing, of any of the Retained Companies or other 
Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, employees or directors (any
such person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving the
Transaction Documents or transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal
counsel (" _Prior Counsel_ ")  currently representing any Designated Person
in connection with the Transaction Documents or transactions contemplated
thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, following the Closing, Prior Counsel
may serve as counsel to any Designated Person in  connection with any matters
related to the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated 
thereby notwithstanding any representation by Prior Counsel prior to the
Closing, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Group Companies)) hereby agrees that, in the event that a
dispute arises after  the Closing between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Group Companies), on the one hand, and any
Designated Person, on the other hand, Prior Counsel may represent one or more
Designated Persons in such dispute even  though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Group Companies) and even though Prior Counsel may have
represented such Group Company in a matter substantially related to  such
dispute.

 

Section 11.16 Currency. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or as
required by Law, all references to currency, monetary values and dollars set
forth herein mean United  States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder
shall be made in U.S. dollars. To the extent this Agreement provides for any
valuation, measurement or test as of a given date based on an amount specified
in U.S. dollars and the subjects of such  valuation, measurement or test are
comprised of items or matters that are, in whole or in part, denominated other
than in U.S. dollars, such non-U.S. dollar amounts shall be converted into
U.S. dollars using the foreign exchange rates published by  Bloomberg as the
Composite 5:00 p.m. New York closing rates (CMPN) one (1) Business Day prior
to the date in question; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of any
calculation or estimate to be provided by one Party to another Party 
hereunder, such calculation or estimate shall be made using the foreign
exchange rates published by Bloomberg as the Composite 5:00 p.m. New York
closing rates (CMPN) one (1) Business Day prior to the delivery of such
calculation or estimate.

 

Section 11.17 Captions; Counterparts. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of  any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.
