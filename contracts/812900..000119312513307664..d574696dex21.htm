Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in
_Section 3.2(b)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions in that
letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is

any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in
accordance with this _Section 3.2_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration upon due surrender of their Shares. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by

 



-15-   shareholders of the Company as of a date that is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become

included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,

resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_.

(g)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate
that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in

preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or

converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Restricted Shares the cash
amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Law relating to Tax with respect to the making of such
payment, within seven calendar days following the Effective Time.

(c) Each award of performance shares granted pursuant to any of the Company
Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested (each, a " _Company Performance Share Award_ "),
shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Performance Share Award (determined pursuant to the last two sentences of this
_Section 3.3(c)_) by (ii) the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of
Company Performance Share Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately
preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law
relating to Tax with respect to the making of such payment, within seven
calendar days following the Effective Time. For any Company Performance Share
Award with respect to which the applicable performance period is complete as
of the Effective Time, the number of Shares subject to such Company
Performance Share Award shall be determined based upon actual performance. For

performance period is not complete as of the Effective Time, the number of
Shares subject to such Company Performance Share Award shall be equal to the
target number of Shares subject to such Company Performance Share Award.

Stock Plans that corresponds to an amount of cash and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (each, a

fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of units
subject to such Company Performance Unit Award (determined pursuant to the
last two sentences of this _Section 3.3(d)_) by (ii) $1.00. The Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the
holders of Company Performance Unit Awards the cash amounts described in the
immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law relating to Tax with respect to the making of such payment,
within seven calendar days following the Effective Time. For any Company
Performance Unit Award with respect to which the applicable performance period
is complete as of the Effective Time, the number of units subject to such
Company Performance Unit Award shall be determined based upon actual
performance. For any Company Performance Unit Award with respect to which the
applicable performance period is not complete as of the Effective Time, the
number of units subject to such Company Performance Unit Award shall be equal
to the target number of units subject to such Company Performance Unit Award.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions necessary
(including adopting such resolutions of the Board of Directors (or any
appropriate committee of the Board of Directors) and providing all required
notices in connection therewith) to terminate each of the Company Stock Plans
and to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 3.3_.

case as of its date, or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as of the date filed with the SEC, and

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established

respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of February 2, 2013, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective and did not identify
any (A) "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the Exchange Act) or (B) fraud or
allegation of fraud that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
Such internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. Since January 29, 2012, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors
or officers has received any material written complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures

(y) exercising or threatening exercise of any termination rights with respect

the Tennessee Business Combination Act, Section 48-103-301 et seq. of the
Tennessee Control Share Acquisition Act and Section 48-103-101 et seq. of the
Tennessee Investor Protection Act) (each, a " _Takeover Law_ ") is applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.5 ___Financing_ __.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as
of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed equity investment agreement
(together with any related documents delivered to the Company in connection
therewith, the " _Equity Investment Agreement_ ") by and among HS Investment
L.P. (the " _Equity Provider_ "), Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board, as
guarantor, and Parent, pursuant to which the Equity Provider has agreed to
invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (being referred to as the " _Equity Financing_ ") and
(ii) an executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letters (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Investment Agreement, the "
_Financing Documents_ ") from the financial institutions identified therein
(including any lenders who become party thereto by joinder, the " _Lenders_
") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein (collectively the " _Debt Financing_ ,"
and together with the Equity Financing and any other equity financing of
Parent undertaken to finance the Acquisition, the " _Financing_ "). As of the
date hereof, the Equity Investment Agreement has not been amended or modified,
no such amendment or modification is contemplated and the obligations and
commitments contained in the Equity Investment Agreement have not been
withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified (subject to any flex
provisions in the Redacted Fee Letter), no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and the obligations and commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Equity Investment Agreement and the Debt
Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, Parent
has issued the Execution Warrants (as defined in the Equity Investment
Agreement) pursuant to the terms thereof, and Parent and the Equity Provider
have executed the Nominating Rights Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement
appended to the Equity Investment Agreement and such agreements will be
effective as of the Closing as so executed. Assuming the Financing is funded

 



-34-   in accordance with the Equity Investment Agreement and the Debt Commitment
Letter, as applicable, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Investment
Agreement and Debt Commitment Letter will in the aggregate be sufficient for
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this
Agreement or the Financing Documents), and any other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the date
hereof, the Financing Documents are (i) valid and binding obligations of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, of each of the other parties thereto
(subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) and (ii) in full force and effect.
As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any other parties thereto, or any failure to satisfy a condition
precedent, under the Equity Investment Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letter; provided that Parent is not making any representation or warranty
regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
in Article IV (it being acknowledged that Parent is not aware of any such
inaccuracy as of the date hereof). As of the date of this Agreement Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to
Parent or Merger Sub on the date of and at the Closing; provided that Parent
is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of the
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article IV (it being
acknowledged that Parent is not aware of any such inaccuracy as of the date
hereof). The Financing Documents contain all of the conditions precedent to
the obligations of the parties thereunder to make Financing available to
Parent on the terms therein and all of the provisions that would permit the
Lenders or the Equity Provider to reduce the total amount of the Financing. As
of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts
or arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Documents. Parent possesses
an irrevocable written consent from, and duly authorized and executed by,
Hudsons Bay Company Luxembourg S.a.r.L. , which is the only consent required
under applicable Law or stock exchange rule or regulation to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 5.1(10) of the Equity Investment Agreement (and
which consent has been provided to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement), and Parent will cause such consent to remain effective and not to
be withdrawn or modified or amended in any material manner between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has received conditional approval from the TSX which approval, together
with the written consent referred to above, would satisfy the condition set
forth in Section 5.1(10) of the Equity Investment Agreement.

(b) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any
Affiliate or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Parents obligations hereunder.

Section 5.6 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per

apply to, any Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended or
modified Alternative Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the
No-Shop Period Start Date.

(e) After the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly (and, in
any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of the Companys Knowledge of any
such event) notify Parent of its entry into any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
of the Companys Knowledge of any such event) notify Parent of the receipt of
any Alternative Proposal or any amendment thereto, or any proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative Proposal (such
proposal or offer, a " _Qualifying Proposal_ "), indicating the identity of
the Person or group making such Alternative Proposal or amendment thereto or
Qualifying Proposal and provide (i) a copy of such written Alternative
Proposal or amendment thereto and any other written Qualifying Proposal
provided (including financing commitments with customary redaction) to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to any Alternative
Proposal or amendment thereto or Qualifying Proposal not made in writing, a
written summary of the material terms and conditions of each such Alternative
Proposal or such amendment thereto or Qualifying Proposal, and shall
thereafter keep Parent informed in reasonable detail, on a prompt basis (and,
in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of the Companys Knowledge of any
such event), of any material developments or modifications to the terms of
any such Alternative Proposal or amendment thereto or Qualifying Proposal
(including copies of any written proposed agreements) and the status of any
discussions or negotiations relating to such material developments or
modifications. The Company hereby agrees that it shall not and shall not
permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement that prohibits or
restricts it from providing to Parent the information contemplated by this
_Section 6.4(e)_ or the other provisions of this _Section 6.4_.

 



-45-  (f) Except as set forth in this _Section_ _6.4(f)_ , neither the Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) change, withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent (or publicly
propose or resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), the
Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (B) fail to include the
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) approve, adopt, endorse or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse or recommend to the
shareholders of the Company, an Alternative Proposal or (D) if a tender offer
or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes
an Alternative Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company shareholders (including,
for these purposes, by disclosing that it is taking no position with respect
to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
shareholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer, and _provided_ that a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be prohibited),
within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such tender offer or
exchange offer (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or
(ii) authorize, adopt or approve or publicly propose to authorize, adopt or
approve, an Alternative Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Board of
Directors may (I) effect a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor) that, as a result of a development, occurrence, event,
state of facts or change (other than an Alternative Proposal) with respect to
the Company that was not known to the Board of Directors as of or prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ "),
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law (taking into account
any adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent
in response to such Intervening Event); _provided_ that such Change of
Recommendation shall be solely with respect to such Intervening Event, and
(II) if the Company receives an Alternative Proposal ( _provided_ that such
Alternative Proposal does not arise from any material breach of the
restrictions in this _Section 6.4_) that the Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustments
to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent in response to
such Alternative Proposal), authorize, adopt, or approve such Superior
Proposal, grant a waiver, amendment or release under any Takeover Law with
respect to such Superior Proposal and cause or permit the Company to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Board of Directors may take the actions described in clauses (I) or
(II) if and only if:

 

(1) the Company shall have provided (i) prior written notice to Parent of the
Board of Directors intention to take such actions at least four (4) Business
Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify, as
applicable, a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event or the
material terms of the Alternative Proposal received by the Company that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, including the identity of the party making
the Alternative Proposal, (ii) if applicable, a copy of such written
Alternative Proposal or amendment thereto and any other written terms or
proposals provided (including financing commitments subject to

 



-46-   customary redaction) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with such Alternative Proposal and (iii) with respect to any Alternative
Proposal or amendment thereto not made in writing, a written summary of the
material terms and conditions of each such Alternative Proposal or such
amendment thereto;

 

(2) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing as
would permit the Board of Directors not to take such actions; and

(3) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement and the Financing that may be offered in writing by Parent by
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4)
Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect
to the actions described in clause (I) above, after consultation with outside
counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Change of
Recommendation, and (B) with respect to the actions described in clause (II)
above, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that
the Alternative Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were given effect.

Each time material modifications to the terms of an Alternative Proposal
determined to be a Superior Proposal are made (it being understood that any
change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material
modification), the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and comply
again with the requirements of clauses (1)  (3) above, with the time period
set forth in each of the preceding clauses (1) and (2) to be three (3)
Business Days. With respect to any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, the Company shall notify
Parent of such material change and comply again with the requirements of
clauses (1)  (3) above, with the time period set forth in each of the
preceding clauses (1) and (2) to be (3) Business Days; _provided_ that, with
respect to an Intervening Event that is not an Alternative Proposal and with
respect to which there has been no material change of facts or circumstances
since the Board first complied with the requirements of clauses (1)  (3)
above, the Company shall be required to comply only once with clauses (1) 
(3) above.

(g) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 6.4(g)_, nothing contained in
this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Board of
Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal securities Law with regard to an
Alternative Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); (ii) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
shareholders of the Company); or (iii) making any disclosure if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under 

 



-47-   applicable Law; _provided_ that neither the Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall effect a Change of Recommendation unless the
applicable requirements of  _Section 6.4(f)_ shall have been satisfied.

(h) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, the approval of the Board
of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be inapplicable to
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be
amended and no Change of Recommendation or other action shall change such
approval.

Section 6.5 _Filings; Other Actions_. 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to _Section
6.4_, include the Recommendation and (ii) Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be included in the
Proxy Statement.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any written request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and Parent shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide the other(s) with copies of all correspondence
between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act applicable thereto and (ii) respond (with
the assistance of, and after consultation with, Parent, as provided by this
_Section 6.5(b)_) as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Company Meeting,
any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement or the other filings shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
thereof, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. Prior to the
filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any SEC comments on the Proxy Statement, each of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall (i) provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement and all amendments or supplements to the
foregoing documents and (ii) consider in good faith such comments reasonably
proposed by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, as applicable.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law (including the
TBCA) and its charter and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders as 

 



-48-   promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company
Meeting_ "), and (ii) unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 6.4_, use reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, no Change of
Recommendation shall obviate or otherwise affect the obligation of the Company
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval in accordance with this
_Section 6.5_.

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period
of two years following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of
termination of the relevant employee), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("
_Company Employees_ "), (i) base compensation (including commission rates) and
annual cash bonus opportunities that, in each case, are equal to the
base compensation (including commission rates) and annual cash bonus
opportunities that were provided to the applicable Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits (excluding, for
this purpose, any defined benefit or cash balance pension plan, equity-based
compensation and post-termination health, medical or other welfare or life
insurance benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits that were provided to the applicable Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) commencing with the 2014
fiscal year, long-term incentive opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the long-term incentive opportunities provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for the 2014 fiscal year a Company Employee who received
long-term incentive opportunities in Fiscal Year 2013 shall receive long-
term incentive opportunities in the 2014 fiscal year the value of which shall
be substantially comparable in the aggregate to the long-term incentive
opportunities that were provided to the applicable Company Employee during
Fiscal Year 2013. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, long-
term incentive opportunities shall include equity-based compensation. Any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Company
Employee whose employment terminates during the two-year period following the
Effective Time, severance benefits equal to the greater of (1) the severance
benefits provided for under the Company Severance Plan in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (2) the severance benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent
as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall

 



-49-   not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents and domestic
partners shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section
6.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) The Company may establish a cash retention program with a retention pool
in the aggregate amount of $3.75 million, with any retention awards from such
retention pool to be paid upon the earlier of (i) the 60th day following the
Effective Time, and (ii) the termination of the applicable participants
employment on a basis that would entitle such participant to severance under
the Company Severance Plan or the participants employment agreement, as
applicable. The retention awards contemplated by this _Section 6.6(d)_ shall
be allocated to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries identified,
and in the amounts determined, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
(or his designees); _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making any award
the Company shall consider in good faith whether an award to an individual
under the retention program would reasonably be expected to result in
payments to such individual being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999
of the Code, or increase the amount of payments to such individual that are
subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, and, if the Company
so determines, the Company shall consult in good faith with Parent regarding
a grant of an award to such individual, with the goal of minimizing any such
negative tax consequences or any associated tax gross-up payments; it being
understood that the Company shall consult in good faith with Parent with
respect to a grant to any individual who is among the thirty highest
compensated individuals at the Company (excluding the individuals listed on
_Section 6.6(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), as reasonably determined
by the Company. If a retention award or portion thereof is forfeited by a
participant prior to the Effective Time, the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (or his designees) may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid
portion thereof) to existing employees or new hires of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, subject to the provisions of this _Section 6.6(d)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.6(d)_, no
retention award pursuant to this _Section 6.6(d)_ shall be made to any
individual set forth on _Section 6.6(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



-50-  (e) The Company shall have the right to pay full year annual bonus awards in
respect of Fiscal Year 2013 upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) following completion of Fiscal Year 2013, with such
payments to be based upon the greater of (x) actual performance (linearly
extrapolating in good faith the Companys performance as of the Closing Date
through the end of Fiscal Year 2013 if the Effective Time occurs prior to the
end of Fiscal Year 2013) and (y) target performance; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that an individuals right to payment contemplated by this _Section 6.6(e)_
shall be subject to such individual waiving in writing the right to receive a
pro rata bonus payment in respect of Fiscal Year 2013 upon a qualifying
termination of employment during Fiscal Year 2013 under the Company Severance
Plan or the individuals employment agreement, whichever is applicable. For
individuals covered by the Company Severance Plan, the written waiver
condition described in the immediately preceding sentence may be satisfied by
an amendment to the Company Severance Plan to the effect that no plan
participant who receives a payment pursuant to this _Section 6.6(e)_ shall be
entitled to receive a pro rata bonus payment in respect of Fiscal Year 2013
upon a qualifying termination of employment during Fiscal Year 2013 so long as
the Company effectuates such amendment more than three months prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(f) Prior to making any material written communications to the Company
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication (
_provided_ that Parent shall review and comment promptly), and Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication.

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement
shall (i) confer upon any Company Employee any right to continue in the employ
or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent,
or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Company
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except
to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent and the
Company Employee, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement or (iii) limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate in accordance with its terms any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement at any time assumed, established sponsored or maintained by any
of them. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall create any third party rights in any
other Person, including any current or former director, officer, employee or
other service provider of the Company or its Affiliates or any participant in
any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other
arrangement (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



-51-  Section 6.7 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of
waiting periods, including the Specified Approvals and the Parent Approvals,
from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval,
clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, subject to _Section 6.12_ and related
provisions, Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay any fee, penalty or
other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Contract or agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly, but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, file any
and all required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) use their reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any
filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations,
waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting
periods are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other
Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) supply to any Governmental Entity
as promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may
be requested pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental Entity and (iv) take,
or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may
assert under any Law (other than with respect to any Action by any
shareholder related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the End Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or

 



-52-   Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or
committing to take any actions that after the Closing Date would limit the
freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or delaying the Closing; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is
binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs. Except as
otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Section 6.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their Subsidiaries and Affiliates
not to) take or agree to take any action that would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially delay the Closing. 

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material actions
pursuant to this _Section 6.7_, and, subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other material communications received by the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written
communications or submissions, and with respect to any such notification,
filing, written communication or submission, any documents
submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third
parties with respect thereto, (y) as necessary or appropriate to address
reasonable privilege concerns or reasonable confidentiality concerns relating
to proprietary or commercially sensitive information regarding Parent and its
operations, provided that Parent shall contemporaneously provide summaries to
Companys counsel of the information redacted pursuant to this subclause (y).
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to participate in any
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited or required otherwise by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.7_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any

 



-53-   proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied
with its obligations under this _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8  _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub and the members of their respective boards of directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of
any press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby without first providing
the other party the opportunity to review and comment upon such release or
announcement, unless such party determines in good faith that it is required
by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, in which
event such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide an
opportunity for the other party to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement prior to making any such press release or other
announcement; _provided_ that (i) the Company shall not be required to provide
any such review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and
existence of an Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or a Change
of Recommendation and (ii) each party and their respective Affiliates may make

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective charters or bylaws or other
organizational documents and/or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions
of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries charters and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
and/or in any agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their
respective

 



-54-   directors or officers as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the
Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification and advancement in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for,
and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its other Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.10_.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of
each of the foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law following receipt if
requested in writing by Parent of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such Person
was not entitled to indemnification under this  _Section 6.10_), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including acts
or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as an
officer, director, member, trustee or other fiduciary in any other entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies and any
policies in place immediately prior to the Effective Time of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time,
Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect
of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. The
Company may (or, if requested by Parent, shall) purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies and any
policies in place immediately prior to the Effective Time of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or

 



-55-   before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that if such tail policy is requested by the
Company, the aggregate premium for such insurance policy shall not exceed
600% of the current annual premium for such insurance. If such "tail" prepaid
policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder.

 

(d) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section
6.10_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the charters or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
arrangement, the TBCA, the DGCL or other applicable Law or otherwise. The
provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors or officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their officers or
directors.

 

(g) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

 

Section 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is or may be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions (including
the "market flex" and "securities demand" and other similar provisions)
described in the Financing Documents, and shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, (i) permit any amendment, supplement or
modification (it being understood that any Alternative Financing shall not be
deemed an amendment, supplement or modification) to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, or replace, the Financing Documents if such
amendment, supplement,

 



-56-   modification, waiver or replacement (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid in respect of
the Debt Financing or original issue discount in respect of the Debt
Financing only if such changes would reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing), unless the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by
a corresponding amount, (B) would (1) add new or additional or otherwise
expand, amend, modify or affect any of the conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend, modify or affect (including with respect to timing)
any other provision of the Financing Documents in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate, or prevent, impede or delay
consummation of, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (2) be reasonably expected to delay or prevent or make less
likely the timely funding of the Financing (or timely satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing), (C) adversely impacts the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against any of the
other parties to the Financing Documents or the Definitive Agreements relative
to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights
against any of such other parties to the Financing Documents as in effect on
the date hereof or (D) would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ that no consent from the Company shall be
required for any (x) amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the
Debt Commitment Letter that is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (including in
replacement of a Lender) and who are (I) set forth on Section 6.12(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, (II) approved in advance by the Company, or (III) a
nationally recognized lender or arranger which in the ordinary course
finances similar transactions or (y) implementation or exercise of any "market
flex" or "securities demand" or other similar provisions provided in the
Redacted Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof, or (ii) terminate any
Financing Document, unless a replacement for such Financing Document
consistent with the foregoing clause (i) has been executed and is in full
force and effect prior to, or simultaneously with, such termination. Upon any
such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with the proviso to this _Section 6.12(a)_,
the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be the Debt Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Financing Documents, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (together with the
Equity Investment Agreement, the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") on the terms
and conditions (including, as necessary, the "market flex", "securities
demand" and similar provisions contained in any related fee letter) contained
therein, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing
Documents and the Definitive Agreements applicable to Parent and its
Affiliates to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing and (iv)
comply with its obligations under the Financing Documents in a timely and
diligent manner ( _provided_ that in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) Parent
and Merger Sub shall not be deemed to have breached their obligation under
such clauses if the failure to satisfy or comply is the result of a breach by
the Company of its obligations contained in this _Section 6.12_ which
prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the Financing). In the
event that all conditions contained in the Financing Documents have been
satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Financing

 



-57-   Sources and the Equity Provider to fund the Financing required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses at the Closing (including by seeking through litigation to enforce
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Investment Agreement and
Definitive Agreements, as applicable). In furtherance of and not in limitation
of the foregoing, in the event that (A) any portion of the Debt Financing
structured as high yield financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor (other than a breach by the Company of this Agreement which prevents
or renders impracticable the consummation of the high yield financing), (B)
all closing conditions contained in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ shall be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction (or waiver in
accordance with this Agreement by the party having the benefit of the
applicable condition) of all conditions at the Closing) and (C) the bridge
facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge
facilities obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.12(b)_) are available
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (or
replacements thereof), then each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the
proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such affected portion
of the high yield financing to consummate the Closing when Parent is required
to do so pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor (other than as the result of a breach by
the Company of its obligations contained in this _Section 6.12_, or a
material breach by the Company of its other obligations contained in this
Agreement, in each case which prevents or renders impracticable the
consummation of the Financing and with respect to which Parent has provided
the Company with prior written notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the
effect of such breach on the availability of the Financing), Parent will (i)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event and in any event no later than the last
day of the Marketing Period, alternative financing (in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with Parents cash on hand, any then-available Equity
Financing and Debt Financing pursuant to any then-available Financing
Documents, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to pay related fees and expenses earned, due and payable as of the Closing
Date) from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than such unavailable Financing
(including the "market flex", "securities demand" and other
similar provisions contained in any related fee letter) and which do not
include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative financing that
are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Financing (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor; _provided_ that in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent required by clause (i) be deemed or
construed to require Parent to (A) seek any additional Equity Financing above
the amount of the Equity Financing or (B) pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Financing Documents (but including any "market flex",
"securities demand" or similar provisions in the Redacted Fee Letter). For
the purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term "Debt Commitment Letter" or
"Equity Investment Agreement," as applicable, shall be deemed to include
any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative
Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter or
Equity Investment Agreement, as applicable, remaining in effect at the time in
question) and the term "Financing Documents" shall be deemed to include any
Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Investment Agreement with respect to any
Alternative Financing

 



-58-   arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter or Equity
Investment Agreement, as applicable, remaining in effect at the time in
question), (2) the term "Redacted Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any
fee letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt
financing arranged in compliance with this _Section 6.12_, (3) the term
"Lenders" shall be deemed to include any lenders providing the alternative
debt financing arranged in compliance herewith, (4) the term "Equity
Investment Agreement" shall be deemed to include any investment agreement,
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
equity financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Equity Investment
Agreement remaining in effect at the time in question), (5) the term "Equity
Provider" shall be deemed to include any Persons providing the alternative
equity financing arranged in compliance herewith and (6) the term "Definitive
Agreement" shall be deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect to
Alternative Financing.

 

(d) Parent shall (i) provide the Company with prompt notice of (A) any breach
or default that could reasonably be expected to impair or impede Parents
ability to obtain the Financing in a timely manner by any party to any
Financing Documents or the Definitive Agreements by Parent or with respect to
any other party of which Parent gains Knowledge, (B) the receipt of any
notice or other communication from any Lender, Equity Provider, or other
financing source (or Parent giving any such notice) with respect to any actual
or threatened breach, default (or accusation of breach or default),
termination or repudiation that could reasonably be expected to impair or
impede Parents ability to obtain the Financing in a timely manner by any
party to any Financing Documents or the Definitive Agreements of any provision
thereof or (C) any dispute or disagreement that could reasonably be expected
to impair or impede Parents ability to obtain the Financing in a timely
manner between or among Parent, on the one hand, and the Lenders and/or the
Equity Provider on the other hand, or among any Lenders to any of the
Financing Documents or the Definitive Agreements, and (ii) keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and
accounting advisers, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any
permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing
(collectively with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ ," it being
understood that for purposes of this _Section 6.12_, for the avoidance of
doubt, Available Financing shall include any offering of debt securities or
incurrence of loans contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and any public
offering of equity securities of Parent) ( _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), which reasonable best efforts shall include (i)

Representatives, gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material
breach of this Agreement, or (B) with respect to any material misstatement or

expressly for use in connection therewith.

(a) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in Parents review of
and planning for any internal restructuring or reorganization of Subsidiaries,
assets or liabilities

(c) If the Company at any time in good faith reasonably believes that it has
delivered the Required Information to Parent, it may (but is under no
obligation to) deliver to Parent a notice to such effect, in which case the
Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Required Information at the time
of delivery of such notice, unless Parent shall provide to the Company within

that describes with reasonable specificity the information that constitutes
Required Information that Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company

Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such information may be shared on a
non-public basis with participants in the Financing who enter into
confidentiality arrangements customary for financing transactions of the same
type as the applicable Financing covering such information reasonably
acceptable to the Company. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective intellectual property rights.

to transfer, as applicable) and (ii) transfer (or cause its Subsidiaries to
transfer, as applicable) to Newco, concurrently with the Closing any real
property identified by Parent; _provided_ that, other than establishing the
legal existence of Newco to the extent doing so does would not in the
Companys judgment have any adverse effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries
or the Companys or its Subsidiaries business, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any Contract, transfer any
property or assets, pay or agree to pay money or any other consideration or
take or agree to take, or refrain or agree to refrain from taking, any other
action relating to the foregoing other than immediately prior to and

of any equivalent governing body of any Subsidiary of the Company) prior to
the Effective Time (or earlier termination of this Agreement), the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any such shareholder Action and shall

(a) (i) The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth
in this Agreement which are qualified by a "Parent Material Adverse Effect"
qualification shall be true and correct in all respects as so qualified at and
as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as though
made at and as of the Closing Date and (ii) the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement which are not
qualified by a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" qualification shall be true
and correct at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the
Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date, except for such
failures to be true and correct as would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) hereof, representations and
warranties that are made as of a particular date or period shall be true and
correct (in the manner set forth in clauses (i) or (ii), as applicable), only
as of such date or period.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations and complied in all material respects with all covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by them prior to the
Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall have delivered to the Company a certificate, dated as of the
Closing Date and signed by its Chief Executive Officer or another senior
officer, certifying that the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_ and

Section 7.3 _Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to Effect the
Merger_. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger and the

_Section 4.2(a)_ (other than the last sentence thereof) and _Section 4.2(b)_
shall be true and correct in all respects, as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of such date (except to
the extent any such representation or warranty expressly speaks of a
particular date, in which case only as of such particular date), except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
are de minimis, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in the last sentence of _Section_ _4.2(a)_ , the second sentence of
_Section 4.1_,  _Section 4.2(c)_, _Section 4.2(d)_ and _Section_
_4.2(e)_ shall be true and correct in all material respects, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of such
date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly
speaks as of a particular date, in which case only as of such particular
date), (iii) the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Article IV_  which are qualified by a

 



-64-   "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification shall be true and correct in
all respects as so qualified, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the

qualifiers) as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Solely
for the purposes of clause (i) above, "de minimis" shall mean that one or more
inaccuracies in or breaches of _Sections 4.2(a)_ (other than the last
sentence thereof) and _Section 4.2(b)_ would cause the aggregate amount
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Article II_ to
increase by $15,000,000 or more.

 

(b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
and complied in all material respects with all covenants required by this

the other transactions contemplated hereby or terminating this Agreement and
abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or  _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied
if such failure was caused by such partys breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

conditions would be satisfied or waived by the Company as of such date)) and
(2) the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing;
and 

(d) by Parent:

(i) at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, in the event of a
Change of Recommendation; or

to _Section 6.12(e)_ and (C) the provisions of _Section 6.3(b)_, this 
_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_ , will survive the termination
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, in no
event shall specific performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligation to
consummate the Merger survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee; Parent Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that:

 

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ if, at the time of such termination, Parent would have

_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, (B) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ or (C) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, (y) the
Company or any other Person shall have publicly disclosed or announced, or
otherwise made generally known to the shareholders of the Company, an
Alternative Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement but prior to
the Company Meeting, and such Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn or
expired by the time of the Company Meeting (or prior to the termination of
this Agreement if there has been no Company Meeting), and (z) within twelve
(12) months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal or an Alternative
Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not the Alternative Proposal
was the same Alternative Proposal referred to in clause (y)); _provided_ that,
for purposes of this clause (z), the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Alternative Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%";

(ii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_; or

(iii) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.1(d)(i)_;

then, the Company shall, (A) in the case of clause (i) above, no later than
two (2) Business Days after the date the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal, pay Parent (or one or more
of its designees) the Company Termination Fee; (B) in the case of clause (ii)
above, prior to or on the day of such termination, pay Parent (or one or more

one or more of its designees) the Company Termination Fee, in each case by

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Following receipt by
Parent (or one or more of its designees) of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with this _Section 8.3_, the Company shall have no further
liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein to Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent related party.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or (ii) by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ if, at the time of or prior
to such termination, the Company would have been entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, then
Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company within
two (2) Business Days of such termination (it being understood that in no
event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion).

_Section 8.3_, the defaulting party shall pay the non-defaulting party
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment is actually received.

 



-68-  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent
fails to effect the Closing when required by _Section 2.2_ for any or no
reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or fails to perform hereunder (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then (A) a decree or
order of specific performance or an injunction or injunctions or other
equitable relief if and solely to the extent permitted by _Section 9.5_ or
(B) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _8.1(b)(i)_ ,
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ and receipt of payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement Obligations shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company (and any
other Person) against any of Parent, Merger Sub, the Lenders, the Equity
Provider, any Financing Sources or any other financing source of Parent, and
any of their respective former, current or future, direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, attorneys, advisors or other Representatives, or any of
their respective successors or assigns or any of the former, current or future
direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, attorneys, advisors or other Representatives or
successors or assignees of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse
Person_ " and together, the " _Non-Recourse Persons_ ") for any breach, cost,
expense, loss or damage suffered as a result thereof or in connection
therewith or related thereto, and in no event shall the Company (or any other
Person) seek or be entitled to multiple, special or punitive damages against
the Non-Recourse Persons, or any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind
against the Non-Recourse Persons.

(e) Other than with respect to the Retained Claims, all Actions or claims
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out of or by reason of,
be in connection with (i) this Agreement, (ii) the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), (iii) any
breach of this Agreement, (iv) any failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and (v) the

tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any Actions or claims
arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the
items in the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (v) except for Actions
or claims that the Company may assert: (A) against any Person that is party
to, and solely pursuant to the terms of, any confidentiality agreement with
the Company; and (B) against Parent and Merger Sub, solely in accordance with,
and pursuant to the terms of, this Agreement, including _Section_ _8.2_ (the
Actions or claims in clauses (A) through (B) of this _Section 8.3(e)_, the "
_Retained Claims_ "). Other than with respect to any Retained Claim described
in clause (A) of the definition thereof, the parties acknowledge and agree
that in no event will Parent and/or Merger Sub have liability for monetary
damages (including monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) in the
aggregate in excess of the Parent Termination Fee (less any portion thereof
that has been paid) plus any expense reimbursement pursuant to _Section
6.12(e)_ (collectively and in the aggregate, " _Parent Expense Reimbursement
Obligations_ "), and the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement Obligations shall be the maximum aggregate liability of Parent
and Merger Sub hereunder.

 



-69-  (f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

(g) The parties acknowledge that the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee are
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ are reasonable forecasts of the actual
damages which may be incurred, and in the event that the Company shall receive
full payment pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, the receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee shall be deemed liquidated damages, and not a penalty, for any
and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company and any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, and upon such payment of
such amount and the Parent Expense Reimbursement Obligations none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
have any further liability or obligation related to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) neither
the Company nor any of its shareholders, Affiliates, Representatives,
directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or agents shall have any
rights or claims against any Lenders and Equity Providers or their
shareholders, Affiliates, Representatives, directors, officers, employees,
controlling persons or agents in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Equity Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (ii) neither the Lender nor any of its shareholders, Affiliates,
Representatives, directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or
agents shall have any liability to the Company or any of its shareholders,
Affiliates, Representatives, directors, officers, employees, controlling
persons or agents relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (iii) neither
the Equity Provider nor any of its shareholders, Affiliates, Representatives,
directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or agents shall have any
liability to the Company or any of its shareholders, Affiliates,
Representatives, directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or agents
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Equity Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. This _Section
9.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
in any document or instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement that by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in part after
the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.12_
and _Section_ _8.3_ , whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs

transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be accepted
as originals for all purposes of this Agreement.

in or in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; _provided_ that, to
the extent required under the Debt Commitment Letter, the law of the State of
New York shall apply (but, for the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect
to the definition, interpretation of the meaning and application of Company
Material Adverse Effect (or other similar event) and whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred, with respect to which issues, Delaware
law shall apply in all cases). In addition, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal
courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a

irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.

over any such Action,

 



-71-   arbitration, claim or proceeding brought against any Financing Source under
the Debt Commitment Letter (including each Lender and any Financing Source) or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, any
Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or
the failure of such transactions to be consummated, and nothing in this
_Section 9.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to provide
otherwise. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.4_,
(b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service
of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective
if such process is given as a notice in accordance with  _Section 9.7_.

Section 9.5 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that,
subject to _Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 9.5(c)_, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or
equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (i) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. Each party acknowledges and agrees that, subject to
_Section 8.3(e)_ and  _Section 9.5(c)_, (A) each party is entitled to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
notwithstanding the availability of any monetary remedy, (B) the availability
of any monetary remedy (1) is not intended to and does not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and
(2) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
partys right to specific enforcement, and (C) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement, in no event shall specific performance of
Parents or Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each party further agrees that (i) no such party will oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity and (ii) no other party or any other Person shall be required
to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.5_,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



-72-  (c) Subject to _Section 9.5(a)_ and _Section 9.5(b)_, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance
to cause Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Closing in accordance with
_Article II_ , if and only if (i) all conditions in _Section 7.1_ and 
_Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such
conditions would be capable of being satisfied as of the Closing Date), and
other than those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by

-74-  Section 9.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted by this _Section 9.8_ shall be null and void;
_provided_ , _however_ , without the consent of the Company, (i) Parent may
assign this Agreement or any of its rights or interests hereunder to any
lender or agent in connection with a secured financing undertaken by Parent or
any of its Affiliates and (ii) Parent may assign this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any of its wholly owned
Affiliates, or any successors by operation of law, or to any Person in
connection with a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of assets or
other similar transaction; _provided_ _further_ that (x) nothing herein shall
relieve Parents obligations hereunder and (y) no such assignment shall impede
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remainder of such term or
provision or the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits, annexes and schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and,
except for the provisions of _Article II_ (which, from and after the
Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of the Common Stock and
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance Share Awards
and Company Performance Unit Awards as of the Effective Time) and _Section
6.10_ (which shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties), is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ that the Financing Sources
and the Equity Provider and its respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers or
Affiliates shall be express third-party beneficiaries of _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3(d)_, _Section 8.3(e)_, _Section 8.3(h)_, _Section 9.4_, 
_Section 9.6_ and this _Section 9.10_.

Section 9.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that after receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE
require further approval of the shareholders of the Company, the
effectiveness of such

 



-75-   amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders of
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company
or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

-76-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
