subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company
intends to distribute to its existing stockholders immediately prior to the

WHEREAS, as a condition to Buyer entering into this Agreement and incurring

Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the

read in its entirety as the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition Sub
except that the corporate name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Digital
Generation, Inc." (or any such name as Buyer may select) and, as so amended,
such Company Certificate shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
and by applicable Law, subject to Section 6.7(a).

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Acquisition Sub, the Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company

 **ARTICLE III. _

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries or held by Buyer or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled,
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock; Aggregate Purchase Price_.

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(a) hereof with respect to sub-clauses (x) and (y) and Dissenting Shares
with respect to sub-clause (y) only) shall be (x) partially redeemed by
conversion into the right to receive the Redemption Consideration and (y)
partially converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, in cash, without interest. The " _Redemption Consideration_ "
shall be a pro rata number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock for each share of
Company Common Stock as determined by the Companys Board of Directors. The "
_Per Share Merger Consideration_ " shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the
Aggregate Purchase Price _less_ the amount of Funded Debt on the Closing Date,
_divided by_ (ii) the Aggregate

 



      
 

 



 

Fully Diluted Common Shares. " _Aggregate Purchase Price_ " shall mean Four
Hundred and Eighty-Five Million Dollars ($485,000,000.00).

 



 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive the Redemption Consideration and Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease
to exist. The holders of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Common Stock shall, other than Dissenting Shares,
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than
the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement, the Redemption Consideration
and the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Payoff of Funded Debt; Exchange of Company Common Stock_

 



 

(a) _Payoff of Funded Debt_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 having been
satisfied or waived by Buyer, Buyer shall pay-off in full the Funded Debt of
the Company pursuant to written instructions provided by JP Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A. as Administrative Agent (the " _Administrative Agent_ ") under the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of July 26, 2011 among the
Company, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (the "
_Company Credit Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Payment Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to Buyer for the payment of the Redemption
Consideration and Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section
3.1(b)(i). At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Buyer shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, cash constituting an amount equal to the
Aggregate Purchase Price less the Funded Debt (such amount as deposited with
the Paying Agent, the " _Payment Fund_ ") and (ii) the Company shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, shares of SpinCo Common Stock constituting the
aggregate Redemption Consideration. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the

 



      
 

 



 

Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions
as Buyer and the Company may reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Redemption Consideration and the Per Share Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide
that at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares may be surrendered, and the Redemption Consideration and the Per Share
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery).

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Redemption Consideration and the Per Share Merger Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for
collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) as soon as
reasonably practicable, after which the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled.
The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Redemption Consideration and the Per Share Merger Consideration
(or the cash pursuant to Section 3.2(e)) payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund or
Redemption Consideration which remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Buyer (or its designee), upon demand, and any such
holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws), as general creditors thereof for
payment of their claim for cash, without interest, to which such holders may
be entitled.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company, SpinCo, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash held in the Payment Fund or any portion of the Redemption
Consideration, in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Buyer or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation in (i) direct obligations of the United States
of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and
interest, or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating
from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division
of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a

 



      
 

 



 

combination thereof. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to and be income of Buyer. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully
satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent
hereunder, Buyer shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Subject to the conditions set forth in each of
Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c), each Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, shall by action of the Companys Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, and without any action on
the part of any holder of any Company Option, become fully vested and be
exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock on a net exercise basis two
Business Days prior to the Spin-Off Transaction (the " _Exchange Date_ "). As
of the Spin-Off Transaction there shall be no Company Options Outstanding.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Subject to the conditions set forth
in each of Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c), each Restricted
Stock Unit, whether vested or unvested shall by action of the Companys Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and without any further
action on the part of any holder of any Restricted Stock Unit, become fully
vested and be converted into a share of Company Common Stock on the Exchange
Date. As of the Spin-Off Transaction there shall be no Restricted Stock Units
outstanding.

 



 

(c) _Necessary Action_. Prior to the Spin-Off Transaction, the Company shall
take any and all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 3.3, including, without limitation, providing holders of Company
Options and Restricted Stock Units with notice of exchange on a net exercise
basis of Company Options for Company Common Stock and the conversion of their

Company Common Stock, Company Options, Restricted Stock Units or other rights
with respect to Company Common Stock shall be granted thereunder.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration and Redemption
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE
III.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.1(b) hereof, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
of Delaware Law, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
exercised and perfected his or her demand for

 



      
 

 



 

appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, but, instead, the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive the Redemption Consideration and such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under
Delaware Law, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Redemption Consideration and Per Share Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law received
by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
or delivered in connection with such demands and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to timely participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law. The
Company shall not (x) make any payment with respect to any such demand, (y)
offer to settle, settle or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of, any
such demand or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with Delaware Law, except in each case, with the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ that no such consent shall be required if such actions
are required by Delaware Law or court order. Any payments required to be made
with respect to the Dissenting Shares to the holders thereof shall be made by
Buyer (and not the Company, SpinCo or Acquisition Sub).

 



 

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
cancelled against delivery of the Redemption Consideration and the Per Share
Merger Consideration, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes in connection with the Spin-
Off Transaction shall be borne by SpinCo and all Transfer Taxes in connection
with the Merger shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. The parties
hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all Tax Returns, applications or other documents with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes.

Authority affecting the rights of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with
respect thereto and no Person or any of such Persons products or services or

Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have in place

to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of their information
technology assets (and all information stored or contained therein or
transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized use, access, interruption,
modification or corruption and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
implemented commercially reasonable data backup, data storage, system
redundancy and disaster avoidance and recovery procedures, as well as a
commercially reasonable business continuity plan, in each case consistent with

Material Adverse Effect, (i) the use and dissemination by the Company and its
Subsidiaries of any and all data and information concerning users of their
websites is in compliance with Companys and its Subsidiaries applicable
privacy policies and terms of use, and (ii) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not violate any such privacy
policies or terms of use.

 



 

(e) _Source Code_. None of the material products or services offered by the
Company or any Acquired Subsidiary with respect to the Television Business
includes or incorporates any software that is subject to license rights
customarily referred to as "open source" in a manner that would require any
source code that is material to such product or service to be made available
to the public.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein, this Section
4.14 represents the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company with regard to matters arising under or relating to Material
Intellectual Property matters.

Company or any Company Subsidiary received written notice of the expected
commencement of any, audits, assessments or other actions with respect to any
Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (iii) there are no waivers
or extensions of any statute of limitations currently in effect with respect
to any Taxes of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2010,

following the Effective Time (i) in all material respects and (ii) in a manner
consistent with the operation of such business immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that the immediately preceding sentence shall not be deemed a representation
or warranty as to any revenue, costs or expenses associated with the conduct
of the Surviving Corporations or its Subsidiaries business immediately
following the Effective Time, and the immediately preceding sentence assumes
the receipt of all necessary authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers

other hand.

closing or mass layoff required by the WARN Act or similar state or local Law,
or incurred any Liability or obligation under WARN or any similar state or

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND ACQUISITION SUB_**

 



 

The following representations and warranties are made jointly and severally by
Buyer and Acquisition Sub:

 



 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Buyer and
Acquisition Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation and has the requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Buyer and Acquisition
Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement (and each other agreement, certificate, document and instrument
contemplated hereby to be executed and delivered by the Buyer or Acquisition
Sub), to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement (and each other agreement,
certificate, document and instrument contemplated hereby to be executed and
delivered by Buyer or Acquisition Sub) by Buyer and Acquisition Sub and the
consummation by Buyer and Acquisition Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action of Buyer and Acquisition Sub
(and, with respect to Acquisition Sub, by its sole stockholder), and no other

delivered by Buyer and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Acquisition Sub
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Buyer and Acquisition Sub
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of (A) Buyer or (B) Acquisition
Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals and authorizations specified in
Section 5.3(b) have been received and the waiting periods referred to therein

any Law applicable to Buyer or Acquisition Sub or by which any property or
asset of Buyer or Acquisition Sub is bound or

which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Buyer or Acquisition Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture
or credit agreement, or any other contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Buyer or Acquisition Sub
is a party or by which Buyer or Acquisition Sub or any property or asset of
Buyer or Acquisition Sub is bound or affected, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences of the type referred to above which would not prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Acquisition Sub
does not, and the consummation by Buyer and Acquisition Sub of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization, order, registration, waiver or permit of, or
filing or declaration with or notification to, any Governmental Authority,
except for the filing of a pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act,
for applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Antitrust Laws, and the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by Delaware
Law and the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market, and where failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Compliance with Law_. Neither Buyer nor Acquisition Sub is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, any Law applicable to Buyer or
Acquisition Sub or by which any property or asset of Buyer or Acquisition Sub
is bound or affected that would prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no claim, action, proceeding, or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against any of
Buyer or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective properties or assets at
law or in equity, and there are no orders before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority, in each case, that would prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Financial Ability_. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has
received and accepted (a) an executed equity financing letter dated the date
hereof (the " _Equity Financing Letter_ ") from Spectrum Equity Investors VI,
L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ ") to provide equity financing (the "Equity Financing")
in an aggregate amount of $47,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, (b) executed debt financing letter dated August 12, 2013 (the "
_Debt Financing Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Financing Letter, the
" _Financing Letters_ ") from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and SunTrust Bank
(collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have
indicated their intent to use reasonable best efforts to structure and
syndicate a debt financing (the " _Debt Financing_ ") in an aggregate amount
of $475,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. A true
and complete copy of each Financing Letter has been previously provided to the
Company. The Debt Financing Letter does not constitute a commitment by the
Lenders to provide funds for the Debt Financing and, subsequent to the date
hereof, Buyer and Acquisition Sub intend to use reasonable best efforts to
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing with the
Lenders or an alternative

 



      
 

 



 

lender group at the discretion of Buyer and Acquisition Sub. Buyer has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or fees required by such Financing Letters to
be paid on or before the date hereof and will pay all additional fees as they
become due. As of the date hereof, (a) each Financing Letter (i) is valid and
in full force and effect without amendment or modification, (ii) does not
contain any material misrepresentation by Buyer and (iii) has not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect, and the Financing Letters
constitute all of the contracts and arrangements entered into between each of
the Lenders, the Sponsor and/or their affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Buyer and/or its affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the Financing,
other than fee letters relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing
contemplated pursuant to the Debt Financing Letters (complete copies of which
have been provided to the Company, with only fee amounts and pricing caps
redacted) (collectively, the " _Fee Letters_ ") and (b) no event has occurred
which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach on the part of Buyer or Acquisition Sub under
any Financing Letter or Fee Letter. In addition, as of the date of this
Agreement, Buyer has received and accepted a letter (the " _Company Equity
Commitment_ ") from the Company by which the Company has agreed to cause
SpinCo to invest $40,000,000 in Buyer at closing for preferred equity
securities of ER having a nominal value of $45,000,000 (the " _Company
Investment_ "), and ER has agreed to accept such investment from SpinCo or to
pay SpinCo $5,000,000 at Closing. The equity commitment and debt arrangements
contemplated by the Financing Letters, the Company Investment and the
definitive financing arrangements entered into after the date hereof with the
Sponsor and the Lenders or an alternative lender group are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Financing_ ". The aggregate proceeds contemplated
by the Financing Letters and the Company Investment together with available
cash of Buyer and Acquisition Sub, will be sufficient for Acquisition Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to satisfy all of the obligations of Buyer and Acquisition Sub
under this Agreement, including (i) paying the Aggregate Purchase Price at
Closing, including effecting the repayment or refinancing of all Funded Debt
of the Company as of the Closing Date and (ii) paying all related fees and
expenses. Neither Buyer nor Acquisition Sub has incurred any obligation,
commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, and neither of them is
contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or liability
of any kind, in either case which would reasonably be expected to cause the
prior sentence to no longer be accurate. As of the date hereof, neither Buyer
nor Acquisition Sub (a) has any reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the financing pursuant to the Financing Letters would not reasonably be
expected to be satisfied or that the financing pursuant to the Financing
Letters would not reasonably be expected to be available to Buyer and
Acquisition Sub on the Closing Date and (b) is aware of any event that has
occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Buyer or, to the knowledge
of the Buyer, any other party thereto, under any of the Financing Letters.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Brokers_. Except for the Buyers financial advisor, no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Buyer.

should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
such party shall promptly inform the other. Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and
the Company agree to correct any material information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. All

Proposal, (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iv) grant any waiver,

discussions or negotiations with such person with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking any action described
in clause (i) or (ii) above, (x) the Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, failure to consider such Acquisition Proposal would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to stockholders and such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal and (y) the Company shall give written notice to Buyer of
any such determination. The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than

_Change of Recommendation_ ") or, in the absence of a Change of Recommendation
made in compliance with this Agreement, fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose to authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise), an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative

Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of Section 6.6(a) or
6.6(b)) that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes
a Superior Proposal, approve, recommend or declare advisable, and authorize
the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to, such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d) if:

 



 

(i) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
be a violation of its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law
and the Company shall have complied with all of its obligations under this

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Buyer, at least
four Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), which

relating to such Superior Proposal;

 



 

(iii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of

a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Buyer were to be
given effect; _provided_ that, in the event of any material revisions to the
Acquisition Proposal (with any change in the per share price contemplated
thereby being deemed material for purposes of this Agreement) that the Board
of Directors has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Buyer in respect of such modified
Acquisition Proposal and to again comply with the requirements of this Section
6.6(c) with respect to such new written notice, except that the applicable
time periods for purposes of this Section 6.6(c) with respect to such new
written notice shall be reduced to two Business Days from the four Business
Day period otherwise contemplated.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Company
acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 6.6 by any representative of the Company or its subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.6 by the Company. The Company
shall not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
contract (other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted by Section
6.6(b)) contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal unless
and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and the
Company has paid all amounts due to Buyer pursuant to ARTICLE VIII.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof from (i) complying
with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-
and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company) (it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to be a
Change of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company
expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
communication).

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify
Buyer (orally and in writing) if any Acquisition Proposal is received by or
any non-public information or access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or its Subsidiaries is requested from the
Company or any of its representatives, indicating the identity of the person
or group of persons making such offer or proposal and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers, and thereafter shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of
any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status
of any discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys
intentions as previously notified.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) The Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any person relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date of this Agreement except for an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as permitted or required pursuant to this
Section 6.6, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall enter
into any agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Buyer any
information provided or made available to any other person pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Acquisition Proposal for or in respect of, or that if consummated would be
reasonably likely to result in the ownership of all of the outstanding Company
Common Stock (whether by merger or otherwise) or all or substantially all of
the Companys and its subsidiaries assets (whether measured exclusive or
inclusive of SpinCo and the assets of the Companys online business as the
case may be), made by any person on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of
Directors of the Company in good faith considers to be appropriate (including
the conditionality and the timing, the likelihood of consummation of such
proposal and the financing thereof), to be more favorable to the Company and
its stockholders from a financial perspective than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger. Reference to "this Agreement"
and "the Merger" in this Section 6.6(h) shall be deemed to include any
proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger that is
agreed to by Buyer.

 



 

(i) The understanding of the parties is that prior to the termination of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement prohibit the Company from, among
other matters, soliciting or engaging in discussions regarding an Acquisition
Proposal for the Company or the Television Business (subject to the terms,
conditions and exceptions contained in Section 6.6(b) and (c)), but allow the
Company to, among other matters, solicit or engage in discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal for the Online Business, _provided_ that any such
soliciting or discussions shall not be allowed to interfere with or delay the
Companys obligations under this Agreement or any of the Spin-Off Agreements.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees that it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been
permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred). Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of the Acquired Subsidiaries (i) to maintain
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions
in its certificate of

 



      
 

 



 

incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Companys and such Acquired Subsidiaries former and
current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable
to those persons than the provisions of the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and other organizational documents of the Company or such Acquired
Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and
(ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect
that would adversely affect the rights of those persons thereunder, in each
case, except as required by Law. Buyer shall assume, and be jointly and
severally liable for, and shall cause the Company and the Acquired
Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this Section 6.7.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys or any of its subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which will be made
available to Company or its agents or representatives) on terms not materially
less favorable in the aggregate than the terms of such current insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation may
cause coverage to be extended under the current directors and officers
liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing terms not
materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. If any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, any
insurance required to be maintained under this Section 6.7 shall be continued
in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary: (i)
this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and SpinCo; and (ii) SpinCo will be solely
responsible for all costs of any nature whatsoever in providing the
indemnification and insurance coverage contained in this Section 6.7. In the
event that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or SpinCo or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation, or SpinCo as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the consent
of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer and (ii) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by such party that would reasonably be
expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a),
respectively, not to be satisfied. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Buyer of, and cooperate with Buyer in connection with, (i) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or

 



      
 

 



 

proceedings commenced, pending, relating to, involving or otherwise affecting
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors
or employees, which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Spin-Off Transaction) and (ii) any
stockholder litigation or claims against the Company, any of its subsidiaries
or their respective officers, directors or employees relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Spin-Off Transaction). No settlement in connection with any claim, suit,
hearing, proceeding or litigation referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above
shall be agreed to without Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Spin-Off Transaction, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of
the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as may be required by Law or any stock exchange listing agreement to
which Buyer or the Company is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall be permitted to make such announcements and disclosures as it
reasonably deems necessary or advisable to the extent such statements relate
solely to the Spin-Off Transaction or the Online Business and are not
inconsistent with _Section 6.6_ hereof. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, all rights and obligations arising from any
employment contract or employment relationship existing in the Company or in
any of its subsidiaries not assumed or required to be assumed by SpinCo or the
SpinCo Subsidiaries under the Spin-Off Agreements, shall remain with the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to (after giving effect to the Spin-Off Transaction)
each employee of the Company and any of its subsidiaries at Closing who
remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary at the
Closing (each, a " _Company Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Company
Employees_ ") with compensation and benefits under employee benefit plans that
are the same or substantially comparable in the aggregate to, in the sole
discretion of Buyer, those provided by Buyer and its subsidiaries to
comparably situated employees from time to time.

 



 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, determination of the level of
benefits and benefit accrual under the Employee Benefit Plans of Buyer, the
Company, the Companys subsidiaries and their respective affiliates providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), and
for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance
benefits under New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service

 



       
 

 



 

under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under any Company
Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to fully comply with all notice, consultation, effects bargaining or
other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor organization, works
council or group of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect
to any Company Employees based outside of the United States, Buyers
obligations under this Section 6.10 shall be modified to the extent necessary
to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and political
subdivisions thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

 



 

(e) This Section 6.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.10,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.10.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 6.10 will create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director
or consultant of the Company or its subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this
Section 6.10 is intended to amend any Company Benefit Plan, or interfere with
Buyers or the Surviving Corporations right from and after the Effective Time
to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or the employment or provision
of services by any director, employee, independent contractor or consultant.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.10 shall not apply to any
current or former employees, officers, directors or consultants of SpinCo.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Cooperation with Financing_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, at Buyers sole expense, to cooperate
with Buyer as necessary in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
its subsidiaries or the Spin-Off Transaction), including (i) participation at
reasonable times in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions,
presentations, road shows, and rating agency and due diligence sessions, (ii)
furnishing Buyer and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company

 



      
 

 



 

as shall be reasonably requested by Buyer, (iii) reasonably assisting Buyer
and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents for any portion of the Financing and (B) materials for
rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Buyer and its financing sources for any portion of the Financing,
(v) reasonably cooperating with Buyers legal counsel in connection with any
legal opinions that such legal counsel may be required to deliver in
connection with the Financing, and (vi) using commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Buyer in obtaining surveys and title insurance as reasonably
requested by Buyer, provided, in each case, that (A) none of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries shall be required to incur any liability in connection
with the Financing (other than the Company Investment) prior to the Effective
Time, (B) the pre-Closing Board of Directors of the Company and the directors,
managers and general partners of the Company Subsidiaries shall not be
required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Financing (other than the Company
Investment) is obtained, (C) none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to execute prior to the Effective Time any definitive
financing documents, including any credit or other agreements, pledge or
security documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents in
connection with the Financing (other than the Company Investment), (D) except
as expressly provided above, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
shall be required to take any corporate actions prior to the Effective Time to
permit the consummation of the Financing (other than the Company Investment),
and (E) Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries, and their
respective pre-Closing directors, officers and representatives, from and
against any liability or obligation to providers of the Financing (other than
the Company Investment) in connection with the Financing (other than the
Company Investment) and any information provided in connection therewith.
Except for the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
ARTICLE IV of this Agreement, the Company shall not have any liability to
Buyer or Acquisition Sub in respect of any financial statements, other
financial information or data or other information provided pursuant to this
Section 6.11. Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Company and its subsidiaries
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its
subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b), as
it applies to the Companys obligations under this Section 6.11, shall be
deemed satisfied unless the Company has knowingly and willfully materially
breached its obligations under this Section 6.11.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing_. Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, on a timely basis, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Letters and the Company Equity Commitment including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and contingencies
applicable to Buyer and Acquisition Sub (or their affiliates) and within their
control in obtaining the Financing set forth therein, (ii) maintain in effect
the Financing Letters except in connection with entering into definitive
documentation with respect to the Financing, which definitive documentation
shall replace the Financing Letters on the terms set forth therein, (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Letters or on other terms
in the aggregate not materially less favorable to Buyer, (iv) timely prepare
the necessary offering circulars, private placement

 



      
 

 



 

memoranda, or other offering documents or marketing materials with respect to
the Financing, (v) commence the syndication activities contemplated by the
Debt Financing Letter and (vi) consummate the financing pursuant to the
Financing Letters and, to the extent contemplated by the Company Equity
Commitment, the Company Investment, at or prior to Closing. Buyer shall give
the Company prompt written notice (A) of any breach or default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in breach or default) by any party to any
Financing Letter or other Debt Document of which Buyer or Acquisition Sub
becomes aware, (B) if and when Buyer or Acquisition Sub becomes aware that any
portion of the Financing contemplated by any Financing Letter may not be
available to consummate the Merger, (C) of the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any Person with respect to any (1) actual
or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Debt Document or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Financing Letter or other Debt Document (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms
of the Financing or Debt Documents), and (D) of any termination of any
Financing Letter (other than in connection with entering into definitive
documentation for the Financing, which definitive documentation shall replace
the Financing Letters on the terms set forth therein). Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts
to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of executed copies
of the definitive documents related to the Financing (excluding any unredacted
fee letters, engagement letters or other agreements that, in accordance with
customary practice, are confidential by their terms) and copies of any of the
written notices or communications described in the preceding sentence. Buyer
and Acquisition Sub shall (1) comply in all material respects with each
Financing Letter and each definitive agreement with respect thereto (to the
extent related to the Debt Financing, collectively, the " _Debt Documents_ "),
and (2) not permit, without the prior written consent of the Company, any
material amendment or modification to be made to, or any material waiver of
any provision or remedy under, any Debt Document or the Fee Letters (except
that the addition of lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities shall be permitted), including any such amendment,
modification or waiver that (individually or in the aggregate with any other
amendments, modifications or waivers) would reasonably be expected to reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing under any Debt Document (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof)
below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Financing Letters and the binding agreements with respect thereto, or
substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same or alternative financing sources, provided that any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to, or waiver
of, any provision of the Financing Letters that amends the Financing or
substitution of all or any portion of the Financing shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) (A) prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against the counterparties to the Financing Letters, or (C) reduce the
aggregate amount of Financing below the amount required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall
provide notice to the Company promptly upon receiving the

 



      
 

 



 

Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall not be required to institute any legal or equitable
proceedings against any counterparty to the Financing Letters in the event of
such counterpartys breach of any of the provisions thereof.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Non-Solicitation_. During the period from the date hereof until
the earlier of the Effective Time or 30 days following any termination of this
Agreement, Buyer and Acquisition Sub and their Affiliates shall not without
the Companys prior written consent, except pursuant to a general solicitation
which is not directed specifically to any such employees, directly or
indirectly, (i) induce or attempt to induce any person employed with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to leave the employ of the Company or
applicable Subsidiary or in any way interfere with the relationship between
the Company or applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate and such persons, or (ii)
solicit for employment or hire any person who is employed with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall restrict Buyer from soliciting
or hiring any person who is no longer employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any reason. The Company shall endeavor in good faith to
notify Buyer of any Television Business employee known to senior management of
the Company who has declared their intention to leave at or before Closing.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Delay of Meeting_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event Buyer has not delivered to the Company an executed
definitive credit agreement or evidence of other arrangement, in each case
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with respect to the Debt Financing at
least seven (7) calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the Stockholders
Meeting which the Company is otherwise prepared and qualified to hold, the
Company may delay or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting and shall re-convene or
set a date for a new Stockholders Meeting within two (2) Business Days of
delivery of such letters from Buyer, such Stockholders Meeting to be held as
soon as practicable thereafter but not later than ninety (90) days following
the record date of the originally scheduled Stockholders Meeting. If it
becomes necessary to set a new record date for the Stockholders Meeting
pursuant to the prior sentence or as required by Law in connection with the
matters pursuant to the prior sentence, the Company shall do so within two (2)
Business Days of receipt of such letters from Buyer, and the Stockholders
Meeting shall be held no later than twenty (20) Business Days of such new
record date.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 8.2, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to

without any liability on the part of any party

 



      
 

 



 

hereto or its respective affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders other
than for intentional and willful breach of this Agreement. The provisions of
Sections _6.4(i)_ , _8.2_ , _8.3_ , _8.4_ , _8.5_ , _8.6_ , _8.7_ , _8.8_ and
Article IX herein, and the Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Reverse Break Fee_.(a) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company (a) pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i), (b) pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) when all conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
(excluding the condition set forth in Section 7.2(f)), shall have been
satisfied, or (c) pursuant to Section 8.1(f) when all conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(a), where the failure to have obtained the
Requisite Stockholder Approval is due to the Stockholders Meeting not having
been held prior to the End Date pursuant to and in compliance with Section
6.15) and Section 7.2 (excluding the condition set forth in Section 7.2(f))
shall have been satisfied, and as of the date of such termination by the
Company, Buyer was not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i), Buyer shall pay the Company the Reverse Break Fee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(f) shall, in no event, be required in
determining whether Buyer is required to pay the Company the Reverse Break
Fee. The Reverse Break Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
specified by the Company in writing to Buyer on the second Business Day
following termination of this Agreement by the Company as set forth in this
Section 8.3 without offset or deduction of any kind. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall Buyer and Acquisition Sub be obligated to pay, or
cause to be paid, the Reverse Break Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 on more
than one occasion.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Failure of Requisite Stockholder Approval_. In the event this
Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(e) and the Company has not paid the Break Fee to Buyer as contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse Buyer for its reasonable expenses
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed $7,500,000 within two (2) Business Days by wire
transfer of same day funds following presentation of reasonable documentation
setting forth such expenses.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Break Fee_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Buyer pursuant to either Section
8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(g), the Company shall pay Buyer the Break Fee. The
Break Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to one or more accounts specified by Buyer in
writing to the Company on (i) the date of termination of the Agreement by the
Company (in accordance with Section 8.1(d)) or (ii) the second Business Day
following termination of this Agreement by Buyer, without offset or deduction
of any kind. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Break Fee pursuant to this _Section
8.5_ on more than one occasion.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Failure to Pay_. If a party fails promptly to pay the Break Fee
or the Reverse Break Fee or the payment contemplated by Section 6.4(i) or
Section 8.4, as applicable, when due, the obligor shall additionally pay to
the other party (A) interest on the amount of the fee from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the rate publicly
announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as of the date such payment was
required to

 



      
 

 



 

be made, as such banks prime lending rate and (B) if, in order to obtain such
payment, the party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
obligor, the obligor shall reimburse the other party for its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit. The Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub acknowledge
and agree that each of the Break Fee and the Reverse Break Fee and the
payments contemplated by Section 6.4(i) and Section 8.4 is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Merger.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Subsequent Transaction_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), the Company shall pay Buyer the
Break Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts specified by Buyer in writing to the Company in the event that (i)
following the execution of this Agreement and prior to termination of this
Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced, publicly
known or communicated to the Company and (ii) within twelve months following
the termination of this Agreement the Company enters into a definitive
agreement for or consummates a transaction with the party which made the
Acquisition Proposal (or an affiliate thereof) prior to the termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Integral Provisions_. The Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub
acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Sections _6.4(i)_ ,
_6.15_ , _8.2_ , _8.3_ , _8.4_ , _8.5_ , _8.6_ , and _8.7_ , are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, neither Buyer nor Acquisition Sub nor the Company would
enter into this Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to
an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor statutes. References to a person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties hereto agree that if any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that, except as set forth in Section 9.4(b), the parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at law or equity, without any requirement to the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.4(a), it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Buyers obligation
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (x) to cause the Equity Financing and,
to the extent contemplated by the Company Equity Commitment, the Company
Investment to be funded to fund the Merger, and/or (y) to consummate the
Merger only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions in Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 shall have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to be
satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which to be satisfied, is caused by
a material breach by Buyer and Acquisition Sub of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement), (ii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing and, to the extent contemplated by the Company Equity Commitment,
the Company Investment is funded at the Closing, (iii) Buyer and Acquisition
Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2, and (iv) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Buyer that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and, to the extent
contemplated by the Company Equity Commitment, the Company Investment and Debt
Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur, and that it is willing to
waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.3. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Buyers obligations to cause the Equity Financing and the Company
Investment to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has
not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing
and, to the extent contemplated by the Company Equity Commitment, the Company
Investment is funded at the Closing). Under no

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such
grant of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and
payment of the Reverse Break Fee with respect to the same underlying event.

 



 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or
Section 8.1(f) and the Company is entitled to payment of the Reverse Break
Fee, other than with respect to any intentional or willful breaches of this
Agreement by Buyer or Acquisition Sub, the Companys right to receive payment
of the Reverse Break Fee pursuant to Section 8.3 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company or any other Person in such instance, and all
other remedies (including equitable remedies) shall be deemed waived against
Buyer, Acquisition Sub, or any of their Affiliates and upon payment of the
Reverse Break Fee, none of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, except that Buyer or Acquisition Sub upon written notice
to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly- owned subsidiary or affiliate of Buyer, but no such assignment shall
relieve Buyer or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, of any of its obligations
hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits, annexes and schedules hereto), a Letter of Credit
issued by Toronto Dominion Bank naming the Company as a beneficiary in the
amount of $10,000,000 as partial security for Buyers obligations hereunder,
such letters and other documents the parties (and the Sponsor) are exchanging
concomitantly herewith and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and except for: (a) the rights of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Redemption Consideration and the Per
Share Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock held by them
at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.1, and (b) the provisions of
Section 6.7 hereof, is not intended to and shall not confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any

 



      
 

 



 

choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent such Court does
not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred
to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding
for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it
is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts
are an inconvenient forum or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or
that this Agreement or any such documentation may not be enforced in or by
such Chosen Courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims,
actions, suits and proceedings or their causes of action (whether at Law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated b this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the Chosen Courts. The parties hereby consent to
and grant any such Chosen Courts jurisdiction over the person of such parties
and, to the extent permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.9 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid, effective and
sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company irrevocably consents to the
service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any other action
or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on
behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such
process to such party. Nothing in this Section 9.9 shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claims of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Debt Financing sources in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Letters or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 



 

Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two (2) or more counterparts, and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.11 _No Strict Construction_. The parties hereto acknowledge that
this Agreement has been prepared jointly by them and shall not be strictly
construed against any party hereto.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
in writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
before or after the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained and prior
to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State;
provided that, after the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made that by
Law requires the further approval of the holders of the Company Common Stock
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or
supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 9.12 waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party hereto against whom the waiver is to be
effective. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



 

Section 9.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF BUYER, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF.
