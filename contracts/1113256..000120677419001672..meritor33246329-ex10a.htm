If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to the provisions of <U>Section 12.5(a)</U>, it will not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement (i) is solely for money damages in an amount less than the amount available for indemnification payments under the applicable terms of <U>Section 12.4</U>, (ii) does not include a finding or admission of wrongdoing or any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party or any Affiliated thereof and (iii) is accompanied by an unconditional release of all indemnifiable claims against the Indemnified Party.</FONT></P>

No delay in, or failure to give such notice will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies of the Indemnified Party or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such delay or failure has not materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party.

In the event that a Dispute Notice is delivered prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) calendar day period, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections raised by the Indemnifying Party in such Dispute Notice. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree to a resolution of such objection (or any portion thereof), then a memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be prepared and signed by both parties and such resolution shall be final and binding on the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party for purposes of this <U>Article XII</U>.

Subject to the terms of this <U>Article XII</U>, upon the final resolution of any Direct Claim or any portion thereof in which Buyer is the Indemnified Party (whether as a result of the failure to deliver a Dispute Notice, the mutual agreement of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or the determination of a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with <U>Sections 13.6</U> and <U>13.13</U>) if cash remains in the Indemnity Escrow Account, then Buyer and Holder Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the amount of the applicable Losses from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.</FONT></P>
