any In the Money Options held by such Pre-Closing Holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time); and

 

(iv) Each Pre-Closing Holder of In the Money Options shall be entitled to
receive in respect of the In the Money Options held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time a portion of the Net Merger Consideration Amount
equal to (A) the product of (x) the Per Fully-Diluted Unit Merger
Consideration, _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the aggregate number of Units issuable
upon exercise in full of all In the Money Options held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _minus_ (B) the aggregate cash
exercise price payable upon exercise of all In the Money Options held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, (i) holders of Units shall cease to
have any rights as members of the Company and (ii) the consideration paid
pursuant to this _Article III_ upon the delivery of a Letter of Transmittal in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Units, subject to the continuing
rights of the Pre-Closing Holders under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 

3.2 _Payment_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 3.2(b)_ , immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Buyer shall deposit with an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") selected
by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount (the " _Funding Amount_ ") equal to (A)
the Merger Consideration (determined before giving effect to the adjustments
provided for in _Section 3.4_ ) _minus_ (B) the sum of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided_ , that the Funding Amount
shall be reduced by the portion of the Merger Consideration into which the In
the Money Options were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (determined before
giving effect to the adjustments provided for in _Section 3.4_ ), which
portion of the Merger Consideration shall be paid by Buyer to the Surviving
Company on the Closing Date and the Surviving Company shall pay such amount to
the Pre-Closing Holder thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(c)_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time (and in any event no later than ten days after
the date hereof), the Company shall mail or hand deliver to each holder of
record of Units or In the Money Options as of the business day immediately
prior to the date of such mailing or delivery a letter of transmittal in the
form attached hereto as Annex B (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "). As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each Pre-Closing Holder who did not receive such materials prior to the
Effective Time a Letter of Transmittal.

 

(c) After the Effective Time, (i) each Pre-Closing Holder of Units, upon
delivery of a Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled
to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor (subject to the
provisions of _Section 3.4_ ) such portion of the Merger Consideration into
which such Pre-Closing Holder's Units (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Units issuable upon exercise of any In the Money Options held by such Pre-
Closing Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall have been
converted as a result of the Merger, and (ii) on the Closing Date, the Company
will pay to each Pre-Closing Holder of In the Money Options the portion of the
Merger Consideration into which the In the Money Options held by such were
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ through the Surviving Companys payroll
system; _provided_ , _however_ , that a portion of the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to each Pre-Closing Holder pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(iii)_
and _Section 3.1(c)(iv)_ equal to the product of (x) the sum of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ (y) such Pre-
Closing Holders Fully-Diluted Percentage shall be held in escrow in
accordance with _Section 3.4(e)_ and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that any Pre-Closing Holder delivers a complete Letter
of Transmittal to Buyer at the Closing, Buyer shall pay the cash amount which
such Pre-Closing Holder is entitled in consideration for the Units held by
such Pre-Closing Holder (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Units
issuable upon exercise of any In the Money Options held by such Pre-Closing
Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) directly to such Pre-Closing
Holder at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds and the
Funding Amount payable to the Exchange Agent shall be reduced by such amount.
Pending such surrender and exchange of a Pre-Closing Holders Letter of
Transmittal, a holders Letter of Transmittal shall be deemed for all purposes
to evidence such holders right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration into which such Units shall have been converted as a result of
the Merger.

   

(d) At the Closing, (i) Buyer shall pay a portion of the Merger Consideration
equal to the sum of (A) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, to be held by the Escrow
Agent for deposit in a separate escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow
Account_ "), in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (B) the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, to be held by the Escrow Agent for deposit in a
separate escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause
Merger Sub to, pay to the Persons identified in writing by the Company to
Buyer prior to the Closing (in the case of fees and expenses, by invoices) (X)
the Funded Debt other than of the type described in clauses (iii) or (v) of
the definition of "Funded Debt" in accordance with the instructions set forth
in payoff letter(s) in respect of such Funded Debt delivered to Buyer by the
Company pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ and (Y) the Company Transaction Expenses
to the intended beneficiaries thereof as identified by the Company to Buyer
prior to the Closing.

 

(e) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Buyer with payoff letters and forms of Lien releases to satisfy
the Funded Debt paid pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ above, and release all Liens
related thereto, in each case, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer.

 

3.3 _Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount; Estimated Closing Date
Funded Debt; Estimated Closing Date Cash; Estimated Closing Date Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 8.5(k)_ , not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in no event more
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth its good faith estimate of (a) Closing Date Net Working Capital ("
_Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (b) Closing Date Funded Debt
(" _Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt_ "), (c) Closing Date Cash ("
_Estimated Closing Date Cash_ ") and (d) Closing Date Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses_ "), in each case consistent with the terms of this Agreement
(including definitions of defined terms used therein) and in accordance with
the Accounting Principles, together with such schedules and data with respect
to the foregoing as Buyer deems reasonably appropriate to support such
calculations and estimates; _provided_ , that, in no event shall such request
for schedules or data delay the Closing.

   

3.4 _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within ninety (90) calendar days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Holder Representative, together with such schedules and data
with respect to the determination of each of the following as the Holder
Representative deems reasonably appropriate to support such calculations and
estimates, (i) a calculation of Net Working Capital (" _Closing Date Net
Working Capital_ "), (ii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Funded
Debt of the Company (" _Closing Date Funded Debt_ "), (iii) a calculation of
Cash of the Company (" _Closing Date Cash_ ") and (iv) a calculation of the
consolidated liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Company
Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses_
"), in each case, calculated as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing
Date (x) consistent (except as provided in this _Section 3.4(a)_ ) with the
definitions of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash, and Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses (and
in each case any definitions of defined terms used therein) (such amounts
defined by such definitions, the " _Price Components_ ") and (y) in accordance
with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the same accounting principles,
practices, policies, methodologies and judgments applied in the preparation of
the most recent audited balance sheet included in the Financial Statements
(the " _Reference Balance Sheet_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) the
Price Components shall reflect no changes in reserves from amounts contained
in the Reference Balance Sheet, other than changes therein attributable to
changes in facts and circumstances occurring after the date of the Reference
Balance Sheet, (II) except as set forth in the following clause (V), the
calculation of the Price Components shall not give effect to the consummation
of the Merger, including any payments of cash in respect of the Merger
Consideration or any financing transactions in connection therewith or, after
the Effective Time, any other action or omission by Buyer, the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is not in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (III) the treatment of leases as
capital leases or operating leases shall be identical to their treatment in
the Reference Balance Sheet, (IV) the Price Components shall not reflect any
expense or liability for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement and
(V) the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital shall include the
effects of any deductions or other Tax benefits arising in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the accounting
principles, practices, policies, methodologies and judgments in subsection (y)
being referred to collectively as the " _Accounting Principles_ ").

 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall provide the Holder Representative and
its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such
manner as to not interfere with the normal operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the records, properties, appropriate personnel and (subject
to the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the calculation of the Price
Components and shall cause the appropriate personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Holder Representative's reasonable requests
in connection with its review of the calculation of the Price Components.

   

(c) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with such calculations of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash
or Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, it shall notify Buyer of
such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within forty-five (45) days after its
receipt of the calculation of the Price Components pursuant to _Section
3.4(a)_. In the event that the Holder Representative does not provide a notice
of disagreement within such forty-five (45)-day period, the Holder
Representative and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed to the calculations of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash
and Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses delivered by Buyer, which
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the
event any notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and the Holder
Representative shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of fifteen (15)
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash or Closing Date Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses. If, at the end of such period, they are unable
to resolve such disagreements, then any such remaining disagreements shall be
resolved by Protiviti Inc. or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to serve in
such capacity, such other nationally recognized independent accounting or
financial consulting firm as may be mutually selected by Buyer and the Holder
Representative (such firm, subject to the following proviso, the " _Auditor_
"); _provided_ , that if the Holder Representative and Buyer cannot agree on
such alternative Auditor, either party may request that the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") choose the Auditor, in which case the
AAA's choice of the Auditor will be binding and the expenses of the AAA will
be shared 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Holder Representative. Each of Buyer and
the Holder Representative shall promptly provide their respective assertions
regarding Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing
Date Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses in writing to
the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed to render its
determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably
possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than sixty (60)
days following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Auditor).
The Auditor shall, acting as an expert and not an arbiter, base its
determination solely on (i) the written submissions of the parties and shall
not conduct an independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash
or Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses require adjustment (only
with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) in order
to be determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(a)_ (including the
definitions of the defined terms used in _Section 3.4(a)_ ). The determination
of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date
on which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing
Date Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 3.4(c)_ is hereinafter referred to
as the " _Determination Date_." All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating
to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne
pro rata as between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative as a
Holder Representative Expense, on the other hand, in proportion to the
allocation of the dollar value of the amounts in dispute as between Buyer and
the Holder Representative (set forth in the written submissions to the
Auditor) made by the Auditor such that the party prevailing on the greater
dollar value of such disputes pays the lesser proportion of the fees and
expenses. For example, if the Holder Representative challenges items
underlying the calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Funded Debt and Closing Date Cash in the net amount of $1,000,000, and the
Auditor determines that Buyer has a valid claim for $400,000 of the
$1,000,000, Buyer shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Auditor and
the Holder Representative shall bear the remaining 40% of the fees and
expenses of the Auditor as a Holder Representative Expense.

 

(d) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.4(c)_ ), _minus_ Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, _plus_
(ii) Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt, _minus_ Closing Date Funded Debt (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(c)_ ), _plus_ (iii) Closing
Date Cash, _minus_ Estimated Closing Date Cash (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 3.4(c)_ , _plus_ (iv) Estimated Closing Date Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses, _minus_ Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses (as finally determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(c)_ ). If the
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Merger Consideration shall be
increased by the Adjustment Amount, but in no event shall the amount of such
increase exceed $3,500,000, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
then the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount, but in no event shall the amount of such decrease exceed
$3,500,000. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section
3.4(e)_.

   

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following
the Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (x) Buyer shall pay to each Pre-Closing Holder an amount
in cash equal to (i) such holder's Fully-Diluted Percentage, _multiplied_ _by_
(ii) the Adjustment Amount, and (y) the Escrow Agent shall pay to each Pre-
Closing Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such holder's Fully-Diluted Percentage. If the
Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such amount, the
" _Deficit Amount_ "), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in
any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination Date, (x) the
Escrow Agent shall pay, from the Adjustment Escrow Account, to Buyer an amount
equal to the Deficit Amount, and (y) if any of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
remains after such payment to Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall pay, from the
Adjustment Escrow Account, to each Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal
to (i) the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii)
such holder's Fully-Diluted Percentage. If the Adjustment Amount is zero,
then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within three
(3) Business Days of the Determination Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to
each Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such holder's Fully-Diluted Percentage.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section
3.4(e)_ with respect to In the Money Options shall be paid to the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Company shall pay such amounts through its payroll
system to the applicable Pre-Closing Holders. Upon determination of the
Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_ and _Section 3.4(d)_ , each of
Buyer and the Holder Representative shall execute joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Adjustment
Escrow Amount in accordance with this _Section 3.4(e)_. In no event shall (i)
the Holder Representative have any liability under this _Section 3.4(e)_ or
(ii) any Pre-Closing Holder have any liability under this _Section 3.4(e)_ in
excess of such holder's allocable share of the Adjustment Escrow Amount. In no
event shall Buyer be entitled to payment pursuant to this _Section 3.4(e)_ of
any amount in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount remaining in the
Adjustment Escrow Account.

 

3.5 _Holder Representative Expenses_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Holder Representative may provide to Buyer a written estimate (which estimate
shall include such reserves as the Holder Representative determines in good
faith to be appropriate for any Holder Representative Expenses that are not
then known or determinable) of the aggregate amount of the fees and expenses
incurred, or that may in the future be incurred, by the Holder Representative
on behalf of the Company and the Pre-Closing Holders in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise in its capacity as the
Holder Representative (the " _Holder Representative Expenses_ "), which amount
will not be included in the calculation of Net Working Capital. On the Closing
Date, Buyer shall pay to the Holder Representative, or to such other Persons
(and in such amounts) as may be designated by the Holder Representative, by
wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Holder
Representative in writing at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, immediately available funds in the amount of such estimated Holder
Representative Expenses.

 

3.6 _Exchange Agent_. Promptly following the date which is two years after
the Effective Time, Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to
Buyer all cash and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agent's duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each Pre-Closing Holder may deliver a Letter of
Transmittal to Buyer and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
and similar Laws) receive in consideration therefor, and Buyer shall promptly
pay, the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
as determined in accordance with this _Article III_ without any interest
thereon.

   

3.7 _Withholding_. Buyer, the Company, the Holder Representative, the Exchange
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable or deliverable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to any Person such amounts that
Buyer, the Company, the Holder Representative, the Exchange Agent and the
Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under applicable Tax Law. If Buyer proposes to deduct
and withhold (or have any person making payments on Buyer's behalf deduct and
withhold) any amounts pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ (other than amounts
subject to withholding because of the compensatory nature of the applicable
payment), Buyer shall provide notice of the applicable deduction and
withholding to the Holder Representative at least ten (10) days prior to the
Closing Date and shall cooperate with the Holder Representative to minimize or
eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld in accordance with this _Section 3.7_ , and duly and timely deposited
with the appropriate Governmental Authority, by Buyer, the Company, the Holder
Representative, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

in any such violation, breach, termination or creation of a Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) or (d) result in a violation or revocation of any required
license, permit or approval from any Governmental Authority, except to the
extent that the occurrence of any of the foregoing items set forth in clauses

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) materially and
adversely affect the ability of the Company to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

items).

during the course, or otherwise within the scope, of his or her employment or
engagement with the Company or its Subsidiary; and (ii) to the extent that
title to the same does not vest in the Company or its Subsidiary by operation

or require the consent of any other Person in respect of, the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' right to own or use any Company Intellectual Property in
the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses as currently conducted.

any Software (whether included in the Company Intellectual Property or the
Licensed Intellectual Property) is the subject of any "general public", "open
source", "copyleft" or other similar license(s) or distribution model(s),
neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the

publish, in whole or in part, the source code of any such Software.

indenture or instrument, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (including Merger

claims or other proceedings at law or in equity, or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, investigations, pending before or by any Governmental Authority or, to
the knowledge of Buyer, threatened, against Buyer or Merger Sub which, if
determined adversely, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Buyer or Merger Sub. There is no unsatisfied judgment or any open
injunction binding upon Buyer or Merger Sub which would reasonably be expected

timely manner, to enter into, perform its obligations under, or to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement, and (d) as otherwise
disclosed on _Schedule 5.5_.

furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to comply at the
earliest practicable date with any Antitrust Information or Document Requests
or any information requests under the French Foreign Investment Laws and (ii)
cooperate with the Company in connection with any filing and in connection

described in _Section 7.1(b)_ , Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, take any and all actions required or necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with

Foreign Investment Laws), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned as soon as possible (but in any event prior to the Termination
Date) any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents,
limits or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal, subject to _Section 7.1(d)_.

of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of this _Section 7.1(e)_ ) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer's
obligations under _Section 7.1(b)_ or this _Section 7.1(d)_ shall be absolute
and not qualified by "commercially reasonable efforts" or "reasonable best
efforts". The entry by any Governmental Authority in any Action of a
Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby but requiring any of the assets or businesses of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to be sold, licensed or otherwise disposed or held
separate thereafter (including the businesses and assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries) or requiring terminating any existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall not, individually, or in the
aggregate (together with one or more other changes, events, circumstances,
developments or facts) be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified
in _Article IX_. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Buyer will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, (i) directly or indirectly, through merger,
consolidation or otherwise, acquire any capital stock or other equity interest
in, or all or any substantial portion of the assets of, any Person, (ii) merge
or consolidate with any Person or (iii) agree to take any action referred to
in clauses (i) or (ii) of this sentence.

to the Antitrust Authorities and (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of (A)
counsel fees and expenses of Buyer and (B) retained expert, including
economist, fees and expenses of Buyer, in each case in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   

7.2 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, manager, officer, employee
and agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer
shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in
its certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement
and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' former and current officers, managers,
directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons
than the provisions of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, limited
liability company agreement and other organizational documents of the Company
or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons
thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

 

(b) On or prior to the date hereof, the Company shall, purchase "tail"
coverage (the " _Run-Off Policy_ "), through its current insurance broker for
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are
currently covered by the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer or the Surviving
Company may cause coverage to be extended under the current directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies by obtaining at or prior to the
Closing a prepaid, non-cancelable six-year "tail" policy containing terms not
less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage) with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, any
insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 7.2_ shall be
continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof. The
rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as provided
by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 7.2_ (an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") may at any time be entitled. No right or remedy
herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent or
subsequent assertion of any other right or remedy. Buyer hereby
acknowledges that the Indemnified Persons have or may, in the future, have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by other Persons (collectively, " _Other Indemnitors_ "). Buyer
hereby agrees that, with respect to any advancement or indemnification
obligation owed, at any time, to an Indemnified Person by Buyer, the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Other Indemnitor, whether pursuant
to any certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of
formation, limited liability company agreement, partnership agreement,
operating agreement, indemnification agreement or other document or agreement
and/or pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ (any of the foregoing, an "
_Indemnification Obligation_ "), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) jointly and severally, and at all times,
be the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., Buyer's, the Surviving Company's and
its Subsidiaries' obligations to an Indemnified Person shall be primary and
any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by an
Indemnified Person shall be secondary), (ii) at all times, be required to
advance, and shall be liable, jointly and severally, for, the full amount of
all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to
the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement or
any Indemnification Obligation, without regard to any rights that an
Indemnified Person may have against the Other Indemnitors. Furthermore, Buyer
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any
and all claims (x) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof and (y) that the Indemnified Person must seek expense advancement or
reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Other Indemnitor before the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries or Buyer must perform its expense
advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this
Agreement. Buyer hereby further agrees that no advancement, indemnification or
other payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnified Person with
respect to any claim for which an Indemnified Person has sought
indemnification from Buyer or the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries shall
affect the foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement,
indemnification or other payment to all of the rights of recovery of such
Indemnified Person against Buyer, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries,
and Buyer or the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries shall jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless against such amounts actually paid by
the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to the extent
such amounts would have otherwise been payable by Buyer or the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries under any Indemnification Obligation. Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Holder Representative, on the other hand, shall each
bear fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the Run-Off Policy.

   

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely
and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer and the Surviving Company. In the event that Buyer or the Surviving
Company or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.2_.

 

(d) Buyer shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this
_Section 7.2_.

 

7.3 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date or, as to any employee whose employment is terminated prior to the end of
such twelve (12)-month period, the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the date of termination of such employee's employment with Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries)),
Buyer shall provide (or cause the Surviving Company to provide) each employee
who continues in the employ of Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") at least
the same base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and other employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements, in each case, consistent with the base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, and employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements for similarly situated employees of Buyer as of the Closing Date.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to (1) entitle any
Continuing Employee to continue his or her employment with Buyer for any
period of time, (2) interfere with the rights of Buyer to discharge or
discipline any Continuing Employee (provided that any such discharge or
discipline is effected in accordance with applicable Law) or (3) change the
terms of any Continuing Employee's employment (including with respect to such
Continuing Employee's base salary, wage rate, employee benefits, programs and
arrangements).

   

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit, solely for purposes of eligibility for severance and accrued and
unused vacation, and not for purposes of eligibility, vesting or benefit
accrual under any other employee benefit, program or arrangement of
Buyer that covers such Continuing Employee following the Closing Date, to the
same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing, except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(c) Buyer shall (i) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a
waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively at-work
requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under the welfare plans of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period,
pre-existing condition limitation, actively at-work requirement or other
restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under
the terms of the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii)
give full credit under the welfare plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-
payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year
as the Closing, as if there had been a single continuous employer.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall (i) be construed as an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any
right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or (iii) limit the right of
Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan.

 

7.4 _Retention of Books and Records_. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to retain all books, ledgers, files, reports, plans,
operating records and any other material documents pertaining to the Company
and its Subsidiaries in existence at the Closing that are required to be
retained under current retention policies for a period of six (6) years from
the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law, and to make
the same available after the Closing for inspection and copying by the Holder
Representative or its representatives at such Person's expense, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice
solely for the purpose of obtaining information reasonably necessary for Tax
filings, accounting, legal defense, financial reporting and other similar
needs.

 

7.5 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
contact or communicate with the employees, customers, suppliers, distributors
or licensors of the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries, or any other
Persons having a business relationship with the Company or the Company's
Subsidiaries, concerning the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will this _Section 7.5_
limit, or be construed to limit, Buyer's conduct of its own business
(including through its Affiliates) in the ordinary course of business and
unrelated to the Company, its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, but not limited to, any contact or communication by Buyer
with the employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or licensors of Buyer
or any other Persons having a business relationship with Buyer in the ordinary
course of business and unrelated to the Company, its Subsidiaries, or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

   

ARTICLE VIII. 
 JOINT COVENANTS

 

8.1 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , Buyer and the Company shall each, and shall
each cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use reasonable best efforts

best efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties

foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be

concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or
approvals required in order to consummate the Merger.

after the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver or cause its respective

8.4 _Notice of Events_.

 

(a) During the period prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify the Holder Representative in
writing if Buyer obtains Knowledge of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event or the existence of any fact or condition that would reasonably be
expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations or warranties contained herein had any such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of Buyer's discovery of such event, fact or
condition and (ii) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy
any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
each case in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent that such
material breach or material failure would reasonably be expected to cause any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.3_ to not be satisfied.

 

(b) During the period prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement, the Holder Representative or the Company shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing if either obtains Knowledge of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact or condition that
would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of the Company's representations or warranties contained herein had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of the discovery of such
event, fact or condition and (ii) any material failure on the part of the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder, in each case in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), to the extent that such material breach or material failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
9.2_ to not be satisfied.

    

(c) No such notice by the Company, the Holder Representative, Merger Sub or
Buyer, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 8.4(c)_ shall be deemed to
cure any breach for purposes of Article IV or Article V or have any effect on
any of the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement.

 

8.5 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification solely from the
Indemnity Escrow Account for the following: (A) all Taxes of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including all
Taxes attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date (as described in _Section 8.5(c)_ ); (B) all Taxes of any
other Person that the Company or any its Subsidiaries is liable for under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. Law) as a result of its participation in a combined,
consolidated or similar group prior to the Closing, or as a transferee or
successor as a result of transaction entered into prior to the Closing; (C)
all Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is liable by reason of having been a party to a Tax
allocation, Tax sharing, or Tax indemnity agreement which agreement was
entered into prior to the Closing; (D) any Losses resulting from a breach of
any representation and warranty included in _Section 4.15_ (Taxes); (E) any
Tax liabilities imposed on Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries post-
Closing attributable to "global intangible low-taxed income" (within the
meaning of Section 951A of the Code) earned by a Subsidiary of the Company
that is a controlled foreign corporation (and of which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries are or were a "United States Shareholder" (within the meaning
of Section 951(b) of the Code)) during the period January 1, 2019 through and
including the Closing Date; (F) any Tax liability imposed pursuant to Section

Taxes that should have been but were not included in the final determination
of Company Transaction Expenses pursuant to _Section 8.5(h)_ ; and (H) any Tax
liabilities incurred as a result of the Pre-Closing EV Transfer. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event will any
Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to recover any amounts pursuant to this _Section
8.5(a)_ to the extent a liability in respect of such amount was included in
the final determination of the Price Components (the intention of this
provision to be to avoid "double counting"); and (ii) in no event will any
Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section
8.5(a)_ for any Transfer Taxes other than Transfer Taxes that should have been
but were not included in Company Transaction Expenses pursuant to _Section
8.5(h)_.

   

(b) (i) Holder Representative shall timely prepare, or shall cause to be
prepared, the initial filing of all income Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than Straddle
Periods) with an initial due date (including applicable extensions) after
the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "), at its own expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall provide a copy
of such Pre-Closing Tax Return to Buyer together with supporting
working papers for its review and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at least thirty (30) calendar
days prior to the date (taking into consideration extensions to file) on which
such Pre-Closing Tax Return is to be filed. Along with each Pre-Closing Tax
Return that is provided to Buyer for its approval, Holder Representative shall
provide a summary of all amounts, if any, (along with reasonable supporting
detail) that Holder Representative believes is recoverable from the Indemnity
Escrow Account with respect to such Tax Return. The Pre-Closing Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the most recent past practices
of the Company and its Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by applicable
Law. If Buyer objects to any item regarding a Pre-Closing Tax Return within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Tax Return, the parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any such objection. If any disagreement is not promptly
resolved, either party may submit the matter to the Auditor to resolve such
disagreement under the parameters described in _Section 3.4(b)_. If the
disagreement is not resolved within five (5) days of the filing date of such
Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as proposed by Buyer and will be
amended, if necessary, based upon the decision of the Auditor (with amounts
subject to indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow Account under _Section
8.5(a)_ in respect of such Tax Return (if any) released promptly after the
Auditor has made its determination (but not until after the Auditor has made
such determination)). Buyer shall cooperate with and file any Tax Return
prepared by the Holder Representative consistent with the terms of this
_Section 8.5(b)_.

 

(ii) Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
Straddle Periods and all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods other than Tax Returns to be prepared by
the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)(i)_ (" _Buyer Tax
Returns_ "), at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
provide a copy of such Buyer Tax Return to the Holder Representative together
with supporting working papers for its review and approval (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at least thirty
(30) calendar days prior to the date (taking into consideration extensions to
file) on which such Buyer Tax Return is to be filed. Along with each Buyer Tax
Return that is provided to the Holder Representative for its approval, Buyer
shall provide a summary of all amounts, if any, (along with reasonable
supporting detail) that Buyer believes is recoverable from the Indemnity
Escrow Account with respect to such Tax Return. The Buyer Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the most recent past practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
If the Holder Representative objects to any item regarding a Buyer Tax Return
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Buyer Tax Return, the parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objection. If any disagreement
is not promptly resolved, either party may submit the matter to the Auditor to
resolve such disagreement under the parameters described in _Section 3.4(b)_.
If the disagreement is not resolved within five (5) days of the filing date of
such Buyer Tax Return, the Buyer Tax Return shall be filed as proposed by
Buyer and will be amended, if necessary, based upon the decision of the
Auditor (with amounts subject to indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow
Account under _Section 8.5(a)_ in respect of such Tax Return (if any) released
promptly after the Auditor has made its determination (but not until after the
Auditor has made such determination)). Prior to the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate to take such actions so as to
allow Buyer to file Buyer Tax Returns (including any such Buyer Tax Returns
that are due promptly after the Closing) consistent with timing requirements
under applicable Law.

 

(c) For purposes of determining the treatment of Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period in Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Taxes attributable to
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of ad valorem or property Taxes, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date for which such Tax is applicable and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period for
which such Tax is applicable and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable computed on a closing of the books
basis as if the relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

   

(d) Buyer shall not take any action on the Closing Date but after the Closing
outside the ordinary course of business that could affect the determination of
any current Tax assets or current Tax liabilities taken into account in the
determination of the Price Components or amounts recoverable from the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_. No election in
connection with Section 336 or 338 of the Code shall be made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without the prior
written consent of the Holder Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable
Tax Law, Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, make any election (or fail to take any action that is consistent
with the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that would have
retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or take any other action with
respect to Taxes that could adversely affect any Pre-Closing Holder in its
capacity as such. Any deductions attributable to any Company Transaction
Expenses, Funded Debt, or liabilities included in Closing Date Net Working
Capital, or any other expenses paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to 11:59 on the Closing Date or otherwise economically borne by the Pre-
Closing Holders shall: (i) be taken into account and treated as attributable
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent permitted by Law for purposes of
determining Tax assets and liabilities includible in the determination of the
Merger Consideration; and (ii) be reported on applicable Tax Returns with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries as attributable to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods to the extent permitted by Law.

 

(e) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Holder
Representative and to Buyer a certification dated as of the Closing Date that
meets the requirements of Section 1445(b)(3) of the Code to the effect that
the Company is not and has not been during the applicable period a United
States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code, together with a duly executed notice (as described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.897.2(h)) of such certification to the Internal
Revenue Service (and such certification and notice in a form acceptable to
Buyer); provided, however, that Buyer's only remedy for any failure to deliver
such a certification shall be to make any withholding required by applicable
Law as a result of such failure pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

 

(f) Buyer and the Holder Representative shall cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns (including with respect to the preparation of Pre-
Closing Tax Returns by the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section
8.5(b)(i)_ ), the handling of Tax Contests and any other Tax matters relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and provision of relevant records and making relevant employees and
service providers available to the other party on a reasonable basis.

 

(g) Whenever any Taxing Authority sends a notice of any audit, initiates an
examination of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise asserts a
claim, makes an assessment, or disputes the amount of Taxes (each, a " _Tax
Contest_ ") with respect to any _:_

 

(i) Pre-Closing Tax Period (excluding a Straddle Period) for which Buyer could
potentially make a claim for indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, Buyer shall promptly inform the Holder Representative and the Holder
Representative shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings (with
any costs associated with such proceedings being reimbursable from the
Indemnity Escrow Account) and, subject to the immediately following sentence,
to determine whether and when to settle any such Tax Contest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Holder Representative shall keep Buyer apprised of all
developments relating to any such Tax Contest and shall conduct the defense of
any such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith. The Holder Representative
shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of a Tax Contest if
such settlement, compromise and/or concession would have an adverse impact on
Buyer, affiliates of Buyer, the Company or any its Subsidiaries for any Post-
Closing Tax Period, including the portion of a Straddle Period beginning on
the day after the Closing Date, without the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, with respect
to any Tax Contest for which it has exercised its right of control under this
_Section 8.5(g)(i)_ , the Holder Representative fails diligently to defend or
prosecute such Tax Contest to a final determination, then Buyer shall at any
time thereafter have the right (but not the obligation) to defend or prosecute
such Tax proceeding (with any reasonable costs associated with such
proceedings that pertain to Taxes for which Buyer is entitled to
indemnification hereunder being reimbursable from the Indemnity Escrow
Account). With respect to any Tax Contest for which the Holder Representative
exercised its right of control under _Section 8.5(g)(i)_ but which the Holder
Representative failed to diligently defend or prosecute to a final
determination, Buyer shall have full control of such defense or prosecution of
such proceedings, including any settlement or compromise thereof.

   

(ii) For a Tax Contest (other than a Tax Contest described in clause (i) that
Buyer has elected to control) for which Buyer could potentially make a claim
for indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow Account (for example, a Tax
Contest regarding a Straddle Period) Buyer shall have the right to control any
resulting proceedings and, subject to the immediately following sentence, to
determine whether and when to settle any Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall keep the Holder Representative apprised of all developments
relating to any such Tax Contest and the Holder Representative shall have the
right to participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense. Buyer shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede any Tax Contest (other than a Tax Contest
described in the final sentence of _Section 8.5(g)(i)_ ) that it controls if
such settlement, compromise and/or concession would have any adverse impact on
the Pre-Closing Holders for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or give rise to an amount
recoverable from the Indemnity Escrow Account without the consent of the
Holder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(iii) The provisions of this _Section 8.5(g)_ and not the provisions of
_Section 12.5_ , shall govern the conduct of Tax Contests.

 

(h) Fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes shall be includible as a Company
Transaction Expense. Buyer shall pay all Transfer Taxes when due. The party
responsible for the payment of any Transfer Tax under applicable Law shall
prepare and file such Tax Return at such party's sole expense.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement (including the limitations
included in _Section 6.1_ ), prior to the Closing, the Company shall be
entitled to consummate a partial redemption of equity securities of the
Company with any cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any
proceeds received in connection with Pre-Closing EV Transfer). The Parties
agree that, if the Company elects to consummate such a partial redemption,
such redemption will be treated for Tax purposes as part of an integrated
transaction with the sale of the Units pursuant to this Agreement that
qualifies for sale and exchange treatment under the principles of _Zenz v.
Quinlivan_ , 213 F.2d 914 (6th Cir. 1954), and the Parties will not (and shall
cause their Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent with such
treatment for Tax purposes, unless required to do so by a determination
(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

    

(j) The indemnification provisions contained in _Section 8.5(a)_ shall
terminate on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, and in no event
will any Buyer Indemnitee have any recourse against any Pre-Closing Holder
with respect to any indemnity claim made pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ except
for claims made against amounts held in the Indemnity Escrow Account.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no Buyer Indemnitee shall be
entitled to make a claim under _Section 8.5(a)_ with respect to a third party
claim regarding Taxes until it has commenced litigation, received a notice of
deficiency, or received written notice of an audit or other assessment
pertaining to Taxes.

 

(k) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Holder
Representative shall deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of the unpaid
current income Tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
those liabilities related to the Pre-Closing EV Transfer) as of the Closing
Date (the " _Income Tax Accrual Amount_ "), together with reasonable
accompanying work papers and any other supporting documentation or information
that Buyer may reasonably request, for Buyer's review. The Company shall cause
its employees and its tax advisors who were responsible for the estimate of
the Income Tax Accrual Amount to answer reasonable questions that Buyer or its
tax advisors may raise regarding such estimate. If Buyer raises an objection
to the Income Tax Accrual Amount, Buyer and the Company shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve all objections prior to the Closing. Any Income Tax
Accrual Amount as agreed to by the parties shall be included in the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Parties
are not able to reach agreement regarding the Income Tax Accrual Amount, (i)
in no event shall any such failure to reach agreement delay (or give any Party
a right to delay) the Closing; and (ii) the amount of unpaid current income
Tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected in the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be as proposed by the Company in the
Closing Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the Income Tax Accrual
Amount may be further adjusted in the determination of Closing Date Net
Working Capital pursuant to _Section 3.4_ and (B) nothing in this _Section
8.5(k)_ shall affect or limit in any way the rights and obligations of the
Parties pursuant to either _Section 8.5(a)_ or _Article XII_.

Buyer or Merger Sub, on the other hand, respectively, to (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) otherwise comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X. 
TERMINATION/EFFECTIVENESS

 

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Holder Representative and Buyer;

 

(b) prior to the Closing, by written notice to the Company from Buyer if:

 

(i) there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, such that
the conditions specified in _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ would not be
satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating_ _Company Breach_ "), except that,
if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of ten (10) days
after receipt by the Company of notice from Buyer of such breach, but only as
long as the Company continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such

shall not be effective until the end of the Company Cure Period, and such
termination shall become effective only if the Terminating Company Breach is
not cured within the Company Cure Period;

 

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before August 1, 2019 (subject to (A)
_Section 13.14_ and (B) the proviso to this clause (ii), the " _Termination
Date_ "), unless Buyer's or Merger Sub's breach is a reason for the Closing
not occurring on or before such date, provided, however, that if the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b)_ (or, with respect to
matters addressed in such Sections, _Section 9.1(c)_ ) have not been satisfied
or waived on or prior to such date, but all other conditions set forth in
_Article IX_ have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), then the Termination Date
may be extended by the Company in writing to a date not beyond September 30,
2019;

 

(iii) the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby is
permanently enjoined, prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a
final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction;
or

 

(c) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer from the Company if:

 

(i) (A) there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement,
such that the conditions specified in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_
would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_ "),
except that, if such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of ten (10) days
after receipt by Buyer of notice from the Company of such breach, but, in each
case, only as long as Buyer continues to use its reasonable best efforts to
cure such Terminating Buyer Breach (the " _Buyer Cure Period_ "), such
termination shall not be effective until the end of the Buyer Cure Period, and
such termination shall become effective only if the Terminating Buyer Breach
is not cured within the Buyer Cure Period, or (B) (1) all of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_ have been satisfied (other than those

as of the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ,
and (2) Buyer or Merger Sub has failed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within one (1) Business Day following the date
the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ;

    

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the Termination Date, unless

before such date; or

 

(iii) the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby is
permanently enjoined, prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a
final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section
10.2_ , in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability on the part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, stockholders or members, other than the liability of the
Company, Holder Representative, Buyer or Merger Sub, as the case may be, for
any Fraud in the making of the respective representations and warranties set
forth herein or intentional and willful breach of this Agreement (in each
case, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) occurring
prior to such termination, except that the provisions of _Section 10.2_ ,
_Article X, Article XI_ , _Article XIII_ and the Confidentiality Agreement,
shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the
benefit of the bargain lost by such party or, in the case of the Company, the
holders of Units or Options (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including other opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be
deemed to be damages of such party or, as provided in _Section 10.3_ , the
Termination Date Holders in respect of Units and, to the extent applicable,
Options, as the case may be.

 

10.3 _Entitlement to Damages._

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement, to the extent Buyer or Merger Sub are required
to pay damages in an amount that exceeds the Company's expenses or out-of-
pocket costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any disputes related thereto, such excess (the
" _Holder Damages_ ") represents an amount of damages payable in respect of
losses suffered by the Termination Date Holders in respect of shares of Units
and, to the extent applicable, Options. Accordingly, in the event damages are
payable pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Holder Representative shall, in its
sole and absolute discretion, determine the extent, if any, to which such
damages constitute Holder Damages, and, to the extent the Holder
Representative notifies Buyer of such determination, Buyer or Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall pay such Holder Damages to the Holder Representative, for
the account of, and as agent to, the Termination Date Holders, to one or more
accounts designated in writing by the Holder Representative and the portion of
such damages otherwise payable directly to the Company pursuant to _Section
10.3(a)_ shall be reduced by the amount of such payment to the Holder
Representative.

 

(b) On or prior to the date the Holder Damages are paid to the Holder
Representative in accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_ , or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the Board of Managers of the Company will determine in
good faith which, if any, Options which would have been In the Money Options
as of the Effective Time should be deemed to be " _Damaged Options_ " for the
purposes of determining the Termination Date Holders and each Termination Date
Holder's Termination Percentage. For the purposes of this Agreement, each
Person who holds one or more Units or Damaged Options as of 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the date on which this Agreement is terminated shall be
deemed to be a " _Termination Date Holder_ ".

    

(c) Promptly after the later of (i) the determination in accordance with
_Section 10.3(b)_ of which, if any, Options are Damaged Options and (ii) the
payment of the Holder Damages to the Holder Representative in accordance with
_Section 10.3(a)_ ), the Holder Representative shall distribute the Holder
Damages to the Termination Date Holders, pro rata in accordance with their
respective Termination Percentages, subject to any applicable withholding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that payment of any Holder Damages in respect of a
Damaged Option granted to a Termination Date Holder who was an employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries subject to
Section 409A of the Code at any time during the taxable year of such employee
or independent contractor in which such Damaged Option was granted shall in
all events be subject to the Termination Date Holder's continued employment
with the Company or its Subsidiaries through the date on which Holder Damages
are distributed and any Holder Damages not distributed with respect to a
Damaged Option by reason of this proviso (such a Damaged Option, an "
_Excluded Damaged Option_ ") shall be distributed among all other Termination
Date Holders pro rata in accordance with their respective Termination
Percentages as determined without regard to any Excluded Damaged Options. For
the purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Percentage_ " means, with
respect to any Termination Date Holder, a ratio (expressed as a percentage)
equal to (x) the sum of (A) the number of Units held by such holder as of
11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of termination of this Agreement and (B)
the number of Units issuable upon the exercise in full of any Damaged Options
held by such holder as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of termination
of this Agreement, divided by (y) (i) the sum of the aggregate number of Units
held by all holders as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of termination
of this Agreement, plus (ii) the aggregate number of Units issuable upon the
exercise in full of all Damaged Options held by all holders as of 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the date of termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) The Company, Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
agreements contained in _Section 10.2_ and this _Section 10.3_ are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, neither Buyer nor Merger Sub nor the Company would enter
into this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE XI. 
HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 

11.1 _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
holders of the Units and the Options for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_ "). The parties have
designated Carlyle Equity Opportunity GP, L.P. as the initial Holder
Representative, and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Units shall
constitute ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be
removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or, in the case of a termination of this Agreement, as of such
termination) (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall
be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative. The designation of any Person as the Holder Representative is
and shall be coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in this
_Article XI_ , such designation is irrevocable and shall not be affected by
the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to
act of any of the holders of Units or any of the holders of Options.

   

11.2 _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Holder Representative shall have no obligation to
act, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full power, authority and
discretion to (i) estimate and determine the amounts of Holder Representative
Expenses and to pay such Holder Representative Expenses in accordance with
_Section 3.5_ , (ii) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Holders and (iii) in connection with a termination of this Agreement,
determine the Holder Damages, if any, and collect and distribute (and withhold
from, if applicable) such Holder Damages in accordance with _Section 10.3_.
All actions taken by the Holder Representative under this Agreement shall be
binding upon the Pre-Closing Holders and their successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. The Holder Representative
shall have no liability to Buyer, the Company or any holder of Units or
Options with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity
as the Holder Representative. The Holder Representative shall at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders;
provided, however, that the Holder Representative shall not be required to
follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action
in its capacity as the Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative
is holding funds delivered to it under _Section 3.5_ or _Section 10.3_ and has
been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the
Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative)
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from
funds paid to it under _Section 3.5_ or _Section 10.3_ , released from the
Escrow Account for the benefit of Pre-Closing Holders or otherwise received by
it in its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall
be entitled to indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising
out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder
Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder Representative's
gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the Holder
Representative determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the funds
paid to the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or _Section 10.3_
exceed the Holder Representative Expenses, prior to the release of the Escrow
Amount, the Holder Representative shall transfer such excess amount to the
Escrow Agent solely for disbursement (or otherwise cause such excess amount to
be disbursed) to the Pre-Closing Holders; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, in no event shall such excess amount otherwise become payable to
Buyer.

   

ARTICLE XII. 
INDEMNIFICATION

 

12.1 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing Date but only to the

(a) All representations and warranties in this Agreement will terminate on the
date that is 12 months following the Closing Date (the " _Representation
Expiration Date_ ").

 

(b) None of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that are
to be performed on or prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing. All of
the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their nature are required to
be performed after the Closing shall survive in accordance with their
respective terms (the " _Covenant Expiration Date_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding the above, all claims on or prior to the Representation
Expiration Date and the Covenant Expiration Date set forth above and the
indemnity with respect thereto, will survive the time at which such claim
would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 12.1_ if written notice
asserting a claim for recovery under _Section 12.2_ or _Section 12.3_ as
applicable, and specifying the details of the inaccuracy or breach giving rise
to such claim, shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity
may be sought prior to such time in accordance with the notice provisions of
this _Article XII_.

 

12.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to _Section 12.4_ , from and after
the Closing, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Holder
Representative and the Pre-Closing Holders and their respective Affiliates and
their and their successors and permitted assigns, and all of their respective
officers, employees, directors, stockholders, agents, advisors and
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any and all Losses incurred by any of the Seller Indemnitees following the
Closing to the extent arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach of the
representations and warranties of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement or (b) any breach of the covenants or agreements of Buyer or Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement.

 

12.3 _Indemnification from Indemnity Escrow Account_. Subject to _Section
12.4_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer, its Affiliates (including the

representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") shall be entitled
to indemnification solely from the Indemnity Escrow Funds for any and all
Losses incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees following the Closing to the
extent arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach of the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or (b) any breach of
the covenants or agreements of the Company or the Holder Representative
contained in this Agreement. The indemnification under this _Section 12.3_
shall not apply to indemnity claims with respect to Taxes, which shall be
governed solely by _Section 8.5_.

 

12.4 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 12.3_ with respect to any claim for indemnification unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon,
the Buyer Indemnitees exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "). The aggregate
amount of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ will not exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ "). The Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of
payment of any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.3_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply
to any Losses resulting from Fraud.

 

(b) No individual Losses may be claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees with respect
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.3_ , unless the
amount of such Losses, together with all other Losses arising out of the same
facts and circumstances, exceeds $50,000 (the " _De Minimus Basket_ ") (and
such Losses that are less than the De Minimus Basket shall apply towards
satisfaction of the Deductible). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the De
Minimus Basket shall not apply to any Losses resulting from Fraud.

    

(c) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses to
the extent that such matter was included or reflected in the determination of
the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date
Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and the resulting
Adjustment Amount derived therefrom in accordance with _Section 3.4(d)_ , such
that a Buyer Indemnitee would have already been compensated for such Losses.

 

12.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give
the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Third Party
Claim. No delay in, or failure to give such notice will adversely affect any
of the other rights or remedies of the Indemnified Party or alter or relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party to
the extent that such delay or failure has not materially prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party will, subject to the other provisions of this
_Section 12.5_ , have the right to participate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim (and, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 12.5_
, shall be entitled to elect to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense, and to settle or compromise any such
Third Party Claim if it gives written notice of its intention to control such
defense to such Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim), and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in
good faith in such defense, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party will not have the right to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim and shall pay from the Indemnity Escrow Account the fees
and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party in connection
therewith, to the extent: (i) such Third Party Claim is asserted directly by
or on behalf of a Person that is a Material Customer or Material Supplier,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party does not deliver the notice referred to in this
_Section 12.5(a)_ within the time period set forth herein, (iii) such Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, (iv) the Indemnifying Party, in the reasonable judgment of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, has failed or is failing to
actively and diligently prosecute or defend such claim, (v) it is reasonably
likely that the Indemnified Party (as opposed to the Indemnifying Party) will
bear an amount of Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim that exceeds
the amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (taking into account any
other pending or resolved claims for indemnification (which for these purposes
shall only include the amount of Losses with respect to Third Party Claims
that are reasonable as to amount and merits, as determined jointly by Buyer
and the Company, with each acting reasonably) and the sum of the actual and
reasonably projected unpaid costs and expenses of the defense of all then
unresolved indemnification claims made by Buyer pursuant to _Article XII_ and
the Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party then seeks to assume or
maintain control of the defense of), (vi) Buyer or the provider of the RandW
Policy is required to assume such defense pursuant to the terms of the RandW
Policy, (vii) the Indemnifying Party's assumption of the defense could
reasonably be expected to cause the Indemnified Party to lose all or any
portion of its coverage under any RandW Policy, or (viii) unless the
Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing to be fully responsible,
subject to the terms of this _Article XII_ (including without limitation
_Section 12.4_ ), for the Losses relating to such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, unless otherwise specified in this _Article
XII_ , the Indemnified Party will not compromise or settle any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof as provided in this _Section
12.5(a)_ and the fees and disbursements of such counsel will be at the expense
of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , _however_ , that, if in the reasonable
opinion of outside counsel to the Indemnified Party, there exists a conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that
cannot be waived, then the Indemnifying Party will be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party reasonably determines counsel is
required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to, or is not entitled to,
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to _Section 12.5(b)_ pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party will cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection
with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available (subject
to the provisions of _Section 6.7_ ) records relating to such Third Party
Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-
of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-
defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _that_ , all such access is
during normal business hours and under conditions which shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business and operations of such non-defending party.

    

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this _Section 12.5(b)_. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes control of the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 12.5(a)_ , it will not agree to any settlement without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement (i) is solely for
money damages in an amount less than the amount available for indemnification
payments under the applicable terms of _Section 12.4_ , (ii) does not include
a finding or admission of wrongdoing or any violation of Law by the
Indemnified Party or any Affiliated thereof and (iii) is accompanied by an
unconditional release of all indemnifiable claims against the Indemnified
Party.

 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any action by an Indemnified Party on account of a loss
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by the Indemnified Party as soon as is reasonably practicable after
such Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. No delay in, or
failure to give such notice will adversely affect any of the other rights or
remedies of the Indemnified Party or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such
delay or failure has not materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. Within
thirty (30) calendar days after being notified of any such Direct Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party of whether or not such
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability for such Direct Claim (any such
notice disputing liability, a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If the Indemnifying Party
does not so notify the Indemnified Party that it disputes its liability for
such Direct Claim within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Direct
Claim specified by such Indemnified Party in its notice to the Indemnifying
Party thereof will be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party will be obligated to make
payment therefor according to the provisions of _Section 12.6_ , _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the amount of such liability is not then determinable, the
Indemnifying Party will be obligated to make payment therefor according to the
provisions of _Section 12.6_ when the amount of such liability is agreed to by
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or is finally adjudicated. In
the event that a Dispute Notice is delivered prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30) calendar day period, then the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections
raised by the Indemnifying Party in such Dispute Notice. If the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party agree to a resolution of such objection (or
any portion thereof), then a memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively
determined by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and such resolution shall be final and
binding on the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party for purposes of
this _Article XII_. If no such resolution can be reached by the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party during the thirty (30) calendar day period
following the Indemnifying Party's receipt of the Dispute Notice (or if
resolution can only be reached on a portion of the matters set forth in such
Dispute Notice), then upon the expiration of such thirty (30) calendar day
period, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may bring suit
to resolve the objection in accordance with _Sections 13.6_ and _13.13_.
Subject to the terms of this _Article XII_ , upon the final resolution of any
Direct Claim or any portion thereof in which Buyer is the Indemnified Party
(whether as a result of the failure to deliver a Dispute Notice, the mutual
agreement of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or the
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
_Sections 13.6_ and _13.13_ ) if cash remains in the Indemnity Escrow Account,
then Buyer and Holder Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to
distribute the amount of the applicable Losses from the Indemnity Escrow
Account to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

   

12.6 _Manner of Payment_.

 

(a) Any indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.3_ , shall be made as a
payment to the Buyer Indemnitees solely from the Indemnity Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and as set forth in _Section
12.6(c)_ below.

 

(b) Any indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2_ shall be made as a payment
by Buyer to the relevant Seller Indemnitee.

 

(c) Any payment for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 12.6(c)_ shall
be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable, within ten (10) days after the final determination thereof.

 

12.7 _Tax Treatment for Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement will be treated by the parties hereto as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 

12.8 _Materiality_. For purposes of this _Article XII_ , any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty, and the amount of Losses for which
the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, are entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ , will be determined
without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty.

   

12.9 _Computation of Indemnifiable Losses_.

 

(a) Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ or this _Article XII_ (i)
shall be decreased to the extent of any insurance proceeds (less any
reasonable related costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of
pursuing any related insurance claims) and Tax savings (determined on a "with
and without" basis) that is actually received by the recipient of such amount
(or its Affiliates) in respect of an indemnifiable Loss and (ii) shall be
reduced by any recoveries actually received from third parties pursuant to
indemnification or otherwise in respect thereto net of all costs and expenses
incurred with respect to the receipt of such recoveries, in each case to avoid
any duplicative recovery. For the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to
the RandW Policy, no party hereto shall have any obligation to seek to recover
or bring any action to obtain recovery from any insurance policy or third
party in connection with making a claim under this _Article XII_.

 

(b) In any case where any insurance proceeds, Tax savings or indemnity
payments or other third-party recoveries are realized by an Indemnified Party
subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment
in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnifying Party has
indemnified it pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ or this _Article XII,_ such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying
Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and
(ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending
any claim arising out of such matter.

 

12.10 _R andW Policy_. The RandW Policy shall include a provision whereby the RandW
Policy Provider expressly waives, and agrees not to pursue, directly or
indirectly, any subrogation rights against the Company or its Affiliates, or
any former or current general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives of either
of the foregoing with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder
(except for Fraud). No insured party under the RandW Policy shall waive, amend,
modify or otherwise revise this subrogation provision, or allow such provision
to be waived, amended, modified, or otherwise revised without the prior
written consent of the Holder Representative.

 

12.11 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to
claims to the extent based on Fraud, following the Closing, indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parties and any Parties claiming by or through any Party (including the
Indemnified Parties) related to or arising from any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or otherwise
pursuant to, this Agreement and none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Holder Representative or any Pre-Closing Holder shall have any other rights or
remedies in connection with any breach of this Agreement or any other
liability arising out of the negotiation, entry into or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort,
strict liability, other Laws or otherwise. All representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the
sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this _Article XII_. Furthermore,
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Holder Representative (on behalf of itself
and the Pre-Closing Holders) acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of
Fraud:

   

(i) the parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of
this Agreement and hereby waive any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters);

 

(ii) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement) or any Action otherwise arising out of or related to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as
such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to
the express terms of this Agreement);

 

(iii) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this _Article
XII_ were specifically bargained for among the parties and were taken into
account by the parties in arriving at the Merger Consideration (and the Per
Fully-Diluted Merger Consideration);

 

(iv) after the Closing, no party or its Affiliates may seek the rescission of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(v) the parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm\'s-length
negotiations, and the parties specifically acknowledge that no party has any
special relationship with another party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm\'s-length
transaction.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.4_ shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this _Section 12.11_ and shall not be limited by the terms of this _Section
12.11_.

 

ARTICLE XIII.

13.1 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to the

Agreement by an agreement in writing executed in the same manner (but not
necessarily by the same Persons) as this Agreement. No waiver by any of the
parties hereto of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or

any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in

under _Section 3.5_ ) shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions herein contemplated whether or not such

upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or
rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

13.7 _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including
electronically-transmitted counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 

13.8 _Schedules and Annexes_. The Schedules and Annexes referenced herein are
a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references herein
to Schedules and Annexes shall be deemed references to such parts of this
Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure made by
a party in the Schedules with reference to any section or schedule of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to all other
sections or schedules to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely
for informational purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to
this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed
in connection with the representations and warranties made in this Agreement,
nor shall such information be deemed to establish a standard of materiality.

 

13.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Annexes to this Agreement), the Escrow Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July 13, 2018 between Buyer

agreement among the parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have
been made or entered into by or among any of the parties hereto or any of
their respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings or
agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement exist between the parties, except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

13.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the member of the Company shall not restrict the

amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 13.10_ to the extent
permitted under the Act.

shall be issued or made by or on behalf of any party without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to the
timing and contents of any such announcement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each party hereto and its Affiliates shall be permitted to disclose
information concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(a) to its respective customers, suppliers, employees, lenders and advisors
who (in the reasonable opinion of such party) have a need to know such
information and who agree to keep such information confidential or are
otherwise bound to confidentiality; and (b) in connection with customary
announcements such as earnings calls which do not contain information that is
not otherwise publicly available, in each case without the other parties'
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate
to prepare a joint press release to be issued on or promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement and a joint
press release to be issued on the Closing Date. The Company and Buyer and
Merger Sub agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to
the extent and to the Persons to whom disclosure is required by applicable Law
or for purposes of compliance with financial reporting obligations; _provided_
, that the parties may disclose such terms to their respective employees,
accountants, advisors and other representatives as necessary in connection
with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such
Persons agree to, or are bound by contract or professional or fiduciary
obligations to, keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and so long as
the parties shall be responsible to the other parties hereto for breach of
this _Section 13.11_ or such confidentiality obligations by the recipients of
its disclosure). Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company and Buyer further acknowledge and agree that (x) the Company may
disclose such terms and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (and may provide a copy of this Agreement) to its direct
and indirect equityholders and (y) Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. may
disclose such terms and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions

contemplated hereby to their respective actual and prospective limited
partners and investors in connection with their fundraising and reporting
activities.

   

13.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
parties.

 

13.13 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE
DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT (OR, IF THE DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT SHALL BE
UNAVAILABLE, ANY OTHER COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR, IN THE CASE OF
CLAIMS TO WHICH THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE EXCLUSIVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION,
ANY FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE), AND EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF EACH SUCH COURT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING OR ACTION, WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION, VENUE OR TO
CONVENIENCE OF FORUM, AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF THE PROCEEDING OR
ACTION SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED ONLY IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND AGREES NOT TO
BRING ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IN ANY OTHER COURT. NOTHING HEREIN
CONTAINED SHALL BE DEEMED TO AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN
ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE
PROCEED AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, IN EACH CASE, TO
ENFORCE JUDGMENTS OBTAINED IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT PURSUANT
TO THIS _SECTION 13.13(a)_.

   

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 13.13(b)_.

 

13.14 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent the
Company brings an Action to enforce specifically the obligations of Buyer
and/or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to
comply with any covenant of Buyer or Merger Sub contained herein (other than
an Action to enforce specifically any provision that by its terms requires
performance after the Closing or expressly survives termination of this
Agreement), the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such Action or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action.
The Parties further agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(i)_ and (B) the Holder Damages are paid
pursuant to _Section 10.3_ , then in no event shall the Company be entitled to
seek or receive specific performance or other equitable relief to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement against Buyer
(including the obligation to consummate the Closing or pay the amounts
contemplated by _Article III_ ). In such instances, the Holder Damages shall
be the Company's sole and exclusive remedy.

 

13.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or
agent, attorney, advisor or representative of any such Person or any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company or Buyer under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

   

13.16 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 

(a) _Conflicts of Interest_. Buyer acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP and
other legal counsel (" _Prior Company Counsel_ ") have, on or prior to the
Closing Date, represented one or more of the Holder Representative, one or
more Pre-Closing Holders, the Company, and its Subsidiaries and other
Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees and directors (each such
Person, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, a " _Designated Person_
") in one or more matters relating to this Agreement or any other agreements
or transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related
to a litigation, claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement
or such other agreements or in connection with such transactions) (each, an "
_Existing Representation_ "), and that, in the event of any post-Closing
matters (x) relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to a litigation,
claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or such other
agreements or in connection with such transactions) and (y) in which Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and one or more Designated Persons, on the other hand, are or may be
adverse to each other (each, a " _Post-Closing Matter_ "), the Designated
Persons reasonably anticipate that Prior Company Counsel will represent them
in connection with such matters. Accordingly, each of Buyer and the Company
hereby (i) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause
its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising
out of or relating to the representation by one or more Prior Company Counsel
of one or more Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-Closing
Matters (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ ") (provided that such waiver and
non-assertion will only apply to such representation(s) and will not apply to
any subsequent representation unrelated to a Post-Closing Matter) _,_ and (ii)
agrees that, in the event that a Post-Closing Matter arises, Prior Company
Counsel may represent one or more Designated Persons in Post-Closing Matter
even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), and
even though Prior Company Counsel may (i) have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute or (ii) be
currently representing Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Each of Buyer and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the
Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any communication between any Prior Company
Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Designated Persons_ "), or
any advice given to any Pre-Closing Designated Person by any Prior Company
Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing Representations (collectively,
" _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute between any Designated
Person and one or more of Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates,
it being the intention of the parties hereto that all rights to such Pre-
Closing Privileges, and all rights to waive or otherwise control such Pre-
Closing Privilege, shall be retained by such Designated Persons and asserted
by the Holder Representative on their behalf, and shall not pass to or be
claimed or used by Buyer or the Company, except as provided in the last
sentence of this _Section 13.16(b)_. Furthermore, each of Buyer and the
Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that
any advice given to or communication with any of the Designated Persons shall
not be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the Company or one more
of its Subsidiaries also received such advice or communication) and shall be
owned solely by such Designated Persons. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that a dispute arises between one or more of Buyer, the Company and
their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Designated
Persons, on the other hand, then the Company shall make available to the
Holder Representative, acting on behalf of the applicable Designated Persons,
all books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries relevant to the
dispute, and the Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) waive any
Pre-Closing Privileges of the Company or its Affiliates applicable to such
books and records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and a third party other than a Designated Person, on the other hand, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) assert the Pre-Closing
Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to prevent disclosure of
Privileged Materials to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
privilege may be waived only with the prior written consent of the Holder
Representative, acting on behalf of the applicable Designated Persons (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

   

(c) _Privileged Materials_. All such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all books and
records and other documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries containing any
advice or communication that is subject to any Pre-Closing Privilege relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Privileged Materials_ "), shall be
excluded from the purchase, and shall be distributed to the Holder
Representative (on behalf of the applicable Designated Persons) immediately
prior to the Closing with (in the case of such books and records) no copies
retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Absent the prior written
consent of the applicable Holder Representative, neither Buyer nor (following
the Closing) the Company shall have a right of access to Privileged Materials.

 

(d) _Miscellaneous_. Buyer hereby acknowledges that it has had the opportunity
(including on behalf of its Affiliates and the Company) to discuss and obtain
adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of, and
reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This _Section 13.16_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 13.16_ may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative,
acting on behalf of the applicable Designated Person, and Prior Company
Counsel affected thereby.

 

13.17 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer, for itself, the Company, each
Subsidiary of the Company, each such Person's respective Affiliates and each
such Person's respective successors, assigns, executors, heirs, officers,
directors, managers, partners and employees (each, a " _Buyer Releasor_ "),
hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily releases, discharges and forever
waives and relinquishes all Actions, demands, obligations, liabilities,
defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, and causes of action
of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, that any of the Buyer
Releasors has, might have or might assert now or in the future, against any
member of the Company, any of their Affiliates, its and their respective
successors, assigns, officers, directors, managers, partners and employees or
any such Person's respective heirs or executors (in each case in their
capacity as such) (each, a " _Seller Releasee_ "), arising out of, based upon
or resulting from any Contract, transaction, event, circumstance, action,
failure to act or occurrence of any sort or type related to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether known or unknown, and which occurred, existed or
was taken or permitted at or prior to the Closing; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this _Section 13.17(a)_ shall release, waive, discharge,
relinquish or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Party to the
extent arising out of this Agreement. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced any
legal proceeding of any kind against a Seller Releasee based upon any matter
released pursuant to this _Section 13.17(a)_.

   

(b) Effective as of the Closing, each Member, for itself, each such Member's
respective Subsidiaries and each such Person's respective successors, assigns,
executors, heirs, officers, directors, managers, partners and employees (each,
a " _Member Releasor_ "), hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily
releases, discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all Actions, demands,
obligations, liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs,
counterclaims, and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known
or unknown, that any of the Member Releasors has, might have or might assert
now or in the future, against the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer, any of their
Affiliates, its and their respective successors, assigns, officers, directors,
managers, partners and employees or any such Person's respective heirs or
executors (in each case in their capacity as such) (each, a " _Buyer Releasee_
"), as a right of contribution to the extent arising out of, based upon or
resulting from its status as an equityholder in the Company prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that nothing contained in this _Section 13.17(b)_
shall release, waive, discharge, relinquish or otherwise affect the rights or
obligations of any Party to the extent arising out of this Agreement. Member
Releasors shall refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or
demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced any legal
proceeding of any kind against a Buyer Releasee based upon any matter released
pursuant to this _Section 13.17(b)_.
