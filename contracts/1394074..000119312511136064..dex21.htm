iv PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

 

This PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of May 11, 2011, by and among Equitrans, L.P., a Pennsylvania limited
partnership (the " _Seller_ "), Spectra Energy Partners, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (the " _Buyer_ "), and, solely for the purpose of
_Sections 1.8_ , _1.9_ ,  _4.17_ and _9.15_ , EQT Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation (" _EQT_ ), and solely for the purposes of _Section 9.16_,
Spectra Energy Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _SE
Capital_ "). The Seller and the Buyer are referred to herein as the "parties"
and individually as a "party" Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
elsewhere in this agreement shall have the respective meanings given to such
terms in  _Article X_.

WHEREAS, the Seller is the sole member and owner of all of the issued and
outstanding membership interests in Big Sandy Pipeline, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement
dated as of December 2, 2010 between Seller and the Company (the "
_Contribution Agreement_ "), a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
, the Seller will contribute to the Company certain pipeline assets.

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to
purchase from the Seller, all of the issued and outstanding membership
interests in the Company (the " _Membership Interests_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

Section 1.1 _Sale of Membership Interests._

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Seller shall sell, transfer, assign and convey the Membership
Interests to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall acquire the Membership Interests
from the Seller, free and clear of all Liens other than transfer restrictions
imposed on the Membership Interests pursuant to applicable securities Laws,
statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and Liens created by the Buyer or its
Affiliates, in consideration for which, the Buyer will pay to the Seller (the
" _Purchase Price_ ") an amount equal to $390,000,000 in cash adjusted as
provided in _Section 1.2_.

Section 1.2 _Adjustments to Purchase Price._

(a) The Purchase Price for the Membership Interests shall be (i) increased on
a dollar for dollar basis to the extent that the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date is greater than the Required Working Capital Balance, or (ii)
decreased on a dollar for dollar basis to the extent that the Working Capital
as of the Closing Date is less than the

 



1  Required Working Capital Balance (the " _Working Capital Adjustment_ ").

(b) Not later than two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall prepare in consultation with, and deliver to, the Buyer in writing a
good faith estimate of the Working Capital Adjustment (the " _Initial
Adjustment_ "), together with its calculation of the estimated Final Purchase
Price, in reasonable detail (the " _Closing Date Estimate_ "). The Closing
Date Estimate shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by the Buyer
(subject to _Section 1.4)_ to the Seller at the Closing (the " _Closing
Payment_ ").

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than
sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare in
consultation with, and deliver to, the Seller (i) a balance sheet of the
Company (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") reflecting the Working Capital
as of the Closing (the " _Closing Date Working Capital_ ") and (ii) a
statement (a " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a calculation of the
Working Capital Adjustment based on clause (i) above. The Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with the Buyer in the preparation of the Closing
Statement and provide to the Buyer such data and information as the Buyer may
reasonably request supporting the amounts reflected in the Closing Statement.

 

(d) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on
the date (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") that is 30 days following delivery
thereof by the Buyer to the Seller unless the Seller gives written notice of
its disagreement (" _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyer prior to such date, in
which case such Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with _Section
1.2(e)_, if applicable) shall become final and binding on the earlier of (i)
the date upon which the Seller and the Buyer agree in writing with respect to
all matters specified in the Dispute Notice and (ii) the date upon which the
Final Closing Statement is issued by the Accounting Arbitrator. Any Dispute
Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the item, dollar amount, and basis
of any disagreement asserted.

 

(e) Closing Statement Dispute Resolution.

 

(i) During the 30 days following the date upon which the Buyer receives a
Dispute Notice, the Seller and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to all
matters specified in the Dispute Notice. If at the end of such 30 day period
(or earlier by mutual agreement) the Buyer and the Seller have not reached
agreement on all such matters, then the Buyer and the Seller may mutually
agree to extend the time to resolve in writing any differences that they may
have with respect to all matters specified in the Dispute Notice. In the
absence of any such extension or upon the termination of any such extension
without any additional extensions, the matters that remain in dispute may be
submitted by either party to a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm agreed by the parties in writing (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ") for
review and resolution.

(ii) Not more than 15 days after the parties have agreed upon the Accounting
Arbitrator, each party shall submit to the Accounting Arbitrator any

 



2  supporting materials and calculations with regard to any amounts in dispute
in the Closing Statement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision
resolving the matters within 30 days thereafter, unless the parties reach
prior agreement and withdraw the dispute from the Accounting Arbitrator. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall address only those matters in dispute and, as to
each particular matter in dispute, shall reach a result no more favorable to
the Buyer than as proposed by the Buyer, and no more favorable to the Seller
than as proposed by the Seller. At the time the Accounting Arbitrator renders
its decision, it shall provide a written statement of findings
and conclusions regarding the Closing Statement and any disputed amounts set
forth therein and shall issue a Final Closing Statement reflecting such
decisions.

(iii) The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding on
the parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne
equally by the Buyer and the Seller. The fees and disbursements of the
Sellers independent advisors incurred in connection with the Closing
Statement shall be borne by the Seller and the fees and disbursements of the
Buyers independent advisors incurred in connection with the Closing
Statement shall be borne by the Buyer.

(iv) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall
mean the Closing Statement issued by the Buyer to the Seller or, if disputed
by the Seller pursuant to _Section 1.2(d)_, the Closing Statement agreed to
by the Buyer and the Seller or, in the absence of such agreement, issued by
the Accounting Arbitrator.

(f) Not later than 10 days after the Final Settlement Date, (i) if the total
of the Working Capital Adjustment set forth on the Final Closing Statement is
greater than the total of the Initial Adjustment, the Buyer shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified
by the Seller such difference, together with interest at an annual rate equal
to the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on such date plus two
percent (2%) calculated from, but not including, the Closing Date until, and
including, the date on which paid or (ii) if the total of the Working Capital
Adjustment set forth on the Final Closing Statement is less than the total of
the Initial Adjustment, the Seller shall pay by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, to the account or accounts specified by the
Buyer such difference, together with interest at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on such date plus two
percent (2%) calculated from, but not including, the Closing Date until, and
including, the date on which paid.

Section 1.3 _Pre-Closing Distribution of Cash._

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that prior to the Closing the Company may distribute
to the Seller cash and cash equivalents held by or on behalf of the Company;
provided that the Seller may not cause any distribution to be made to the
extent a distribution would result in a deviation from the Closing Date
Estimate.

 



3 Section 1.4 _Closing Payment Holdback._

 

(a) The Buyer and the Seller agree that the liquidated damages owing from the
Seller to the Buyer for the Sellers breach of _Section 4.14(b)_ shall be
$10,000,000. Determination of the Sellers breach shall not be affected by
whether such breach resulted from reasons partially or totally outside of the
Sellers control, except to the extent such breach was caused solely by the
Buyer. Accordingly, at Closing, the Buyer shall withhold from the Closing
Payment the sum of $10,000,000 (the " _Closing Payment Holdback_ ") to be
delivered to the Seller or retained by the Buyer in accordance with this
_Section 1.4_.

(b) If the Seller timely delivers to the Buyer the items required under
_Section 4.14(b)_ (collectively, the " _Audited Financials_ ") on or before
the date specified in such Section, then the Buyer shall deliver the Closing
Payment Holdback to the Seller within three (3) business days following the
Buyers receipt of the last of the Audited Financials. If the Seller fails to
timely deliver the Audited Financials as required by _Section 4.14(b)_ on or
before the dates specified in such Section, the Buyer shall retain the
Closing Payment Holdback as liquidated damages for the Sellers failure to
timely deliver the Audited Financials.

(c) Payment to the Buyer of the liquidated damages contemplated by this
_Section 1.4_ shall be the Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for the Sellers
breach of  _Section 4.14(b)_. The liquidated damages so paid will be treated
as a reduction in the Purchase Price and the Seller will irrevocably forfeit
the right to any such amount payable.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Closing Payment Holdback
constitutes liquidated damages because the potential injury to the Buyer
resulting from Sellers breach of _Section 4.14(b)_ is uncertain and
difficult to quantify, (ii) the amount of such liquidated damages is, in each
case, reasonable and considers (A) the actual or anticipated harm that could
be caused by the Sellers breach, (B) the difficulty of proving the loss
arising from any such potential breach, and (C) the difficulty of finding
another, adequate remedy at law, and (iii) such liquidated damages are
structured to function as damages resulting from the Sellers breach and not
as a penalty.

Section 1.5 _Time and Place of Closing._

Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties in any respect, the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of the Seller, located at EQT Plaza, 625
Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, on the first
business day of the month following the month in which all conditions to
closing set forth in Article V have been satisfied or waived, _provided_ that
the Closing will not take place (a) until after June 1, 2011 and (b) not
earlier than two (2) business days after all conditions to closing set forth
in Article V have been satisfied or waived. The Closing shall be effective for
all purposes as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the day of the Closing. The
"Closing Date," as referred to herein, shall mean the date of the Closing.

 



4 Section 1.6 _Closing Deliveries._

 

(a) At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Buyer the following, or shall take the following actions:

(i) A counterpart of the assignment and assumption agreement between the

sufficient to convey record title of all such interests to the Company, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, and (c) fully
executed counterparts of all other closing deliverables contemplated in
Section 2.2 of the Contribution Agreement;

(vii) A duly executed certificate, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer, to the effect that EQT is not a "foreign person" and otherwise meeting
the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b);

The Buyer shall be entitled to a partial refund of the Purchase Price on a
quarterly basis as follows:

(a) Attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ is a schedule of quarterly cash targets
for the Company commencing on January 1, 2011 (the " _Targets_ "). The parties
agree that, in the event the aggregate payments for transportation services on
the Pipeline (the " _Transportation Payments_ ") for any calendar quarter
following the Closing Date (pro-rated on a daily basis for any calendar
quarter that begins prior to the Closing Date and ends following the Closing
Date) is less than the Target for that calendar quarter, the Seller shall
refund to the Buyer a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the Quarterly
Shortfall for that calendar quarter.

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar quarter
following the date hereof for which there is a Quarterly Shortfall, the Buyer
or the Company shall deliver to the Seller written notice setting forth the
following (a " _Shortfall Notice_ "): (i) the aggregate amount of
Transportation Payments for the preceding calendar quarter, (ii) the Target
for the preceding calendar quarter, (iii) the Quarterly Shortfall for the
preceding calendar quarter and (iv) wiring instructions. Within ten (10) days
following receipt of a Shortfall Notice, the Seller shall pay by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, to the account or accounts specified by the
Buyer or the Company in the Shortfall Notice, an amount equal to the
applicable Quarterly Shortfall. In the event the Seller should fail to do so,
the amount due shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date payment is due
plus two percent (2%) calculated from, but not including, the date payment is
due until, and including, the date on which paid.

 

(c) If the Seller disputes the Buyers calculation of a Quarterly Shortfall,
the Seller shall remit to the Buyer the amount not in dispute to the Buyer
together with

 



6  written notice of its disagreement and the Sellers basis for such
disagreement. In such event, the parties shall resolve their disagreement in
accordance with the procedures in  _Section 1.2(e)_ and the notice delivered
by Seller pursuant to this _Section 1.7(c)_ shall be treated as a Dispute
Notice for all purposes of _Section 1.2(e)_. Failure by the Seller to give
written notice to the Buyer of its disagreement with the Buyers calculation
of the Quarterly Shortfall on or before the fifteenth (15th) day following
receipt of a Shortfall Notice shall constitute a waiver by the Seller of any
objection to the Shortfall Notice and the Buyers calculation of the Quarterly
Shortfall for the preceding calendar quarter. The fees and disbursements of
the Sellers independent advisors incurred in connection with a dispute under
this _Section 1.7_ shall be borne by the Seller and the fees and
disbursements of the Buyers independent advisors incurred in connection with
a dispute under this _Section 1.7_ shall be borne by the Buyer.

(d) Not later than ten (10) days after the parties mutually agree upon
any amount in dispute or the Accounting Arbitrator submits its final decision
to the parties, the Seller shall pay by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, to the account or accounts specified by the Buyer or the Company in its
Shortfall Notice, the amount agreed upon by the parties or as determined by
the Accounting Arbitrator, together with interest at an annual rate equal to
the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date payment was
originally due plus two percent (2%) calculated from, but not including, the
date payment was originally due until, and including, the date on which paid.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions
of this _Section 1.7_ shall terminate and be of no further force or effect at
such time as (i) (A) FERC shall have granted to Seller or its Affiliates a
temporary waiver, to be effective for a reasonable period of time, of all FERC
capacity release regulations and policies and corresponding provisions of the
Companys FERC Gas Tariff necessary to permit a permanent release to EQT of
the capacity under the transportation agreements referred to in _Section
5.1(f)(i) _at the negotiated rate that applies to such agreements without
complying with the posting and bidding requirements set forth in the capacity
release provisions contained in the Companys FERC Gas Tariff (and the Buyer
shall not oppose any such request for temporary waiver, provided that the
requested waiver would not affect any creditworthiness requirements under the
Companys FERC Gas Tariff or specific contractual creditworthiness provisions
that apply to such transportation agreements); and (B) the firm capacity under
the transportation agreements referred to in  _Section 5.1(f)(i)_ has been
permanently released to EQT, and EQT and the Company have entered into
transportation agreements under the Companys Rate Schedule FTS on the same
rate, contract term and terms and conditions as the transportation agreements
referenced in _Section 5.1(f)(i)_, as amended, covering such released
capacity and such agreements are in effect, and (ii) FERC shall have approved
the extensions of the transportation agreements referred to in Section
5.1(f)(i), as amended, it being understood that no payment shall be due for
the calendar quarter in which the later of the events specified in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this _Section 1.7(e)_ have occurred. 

Section 1.8 _Option for Additional Capacity._

 



7 (a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on January 1,
2018, EQT shall have the option to cause the Company to construct the
facilities, as contemplated by the Precedent Agreement (defined below),
necessary to provide EQT with incremental firm mainline capacity on the
Pipeline, as those facilities may be modified or extended (i) at a selected
volume within the range of 50,000 Dth/day and 150,000 Dth/day, (ii) at a fixed
negotiated reservation rate as set forth in a Precedent Agreement in the form
attached hereto as  _Exhibit F_ (the " _Precedent Agreement_ "), and (iii)
for a term commencing when the facilities are available and ending on the
fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the commencement date (" _Option 1_ "). 

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on January 1,
2018, in the event that the Company conducts an open season upon the request
of a third party for an expansion of the Companys mainline facilities by
installing a compressor unit at MarkWests Kentucky Hydrocarbon gas processing
facility site near Langley, Kentucky, EQT shall have the option to contract
with the Company as part of the open season for incremental firm mainline
capacity on the Pipeline, as those facilities may be modified or extended (i)
at a selected volume within the range of 50,000 Dth/day and 150,000 Dth/day;
(ii) at a fixed negotiated reservation rate as set forth in the Precedent
Agreement (or at any other lower rate that a bidder is required to propose in
order to be an Anchor Shipper in such open season), and (iii) for a term
commencing when the facilities are available and ending on the fifteenth
(15th) anniversary of the commencement date (" _Option 2_ ").

 

(c) Upon the completion of an open season contemplated in Section 1.8(a) or
Section 1.8(b) that results in the filing of an application with FERC for
authorization of the expansion contemplated in the open season, Options 1 and
2 shall terminate and have no further force or effect.

 

(d) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on January 1,
2018, to the extent that any excess capacity remains unsubscribed under an
expansion contemplated in _Section 1.8(a)_ or _1.8(b)_ , EQT may subscribe
for capacity by submitting a request for service, subject to the terms of the
Companys FERC Gas Tariff, in tranches of the lesser of a minimum of 50,000
Dth/day or the remaining unsubscribed capacity that may be available at the
time of the service request, at the fixed negotiated rate set forth in the
Precedent Agreement, and for a term ending on the fifteenth (15th)
anniversary of the commencement date.

(e) In order to exercise Option 1 or Option 2 (together, the " _Options_ "),
EQT shall deliver written notice of exercise to the Buyer prior to January 1,
2018 (an " _Option Exercise Notice_ ") specifying (i) the name of the shipper,
(ii) the volume of additional capacity being exercised and (iii) the
requested in-service date for the facilities, which shall be no sooner than
(A) 12 months from the date of issuance of any FERC authorization necessary
for construction or operation of the facilities, or (B) if no such FERC
authorization is required, 18 months from the date on which the Precedent
Agreement related to the Option Exercise Notice has been fully executed.

 

(f) No later than ten (10) days after delivery of an Option Exercise Notice, 

 



8  EQT and the Company shall enter into the Precedent Agreement, updated as
required to reflect the terms and conditions of the Companys then currently-
effective FERC Gas Tariff (other than credit requirements), and completed to
reflect the incremental firm capacity that EQT indicates in each Option
Exercise Notice.

(g) Notwithstanding the above, EQTs rights under Option 1, Option 2 and
_Section 1.8(d)_, shall be subject to the applicable Precedent Agreement and
the following conditions:

 

(i) At the time of exercising the applicable Option or request for service
under _Section 1.8(d)_, EQT shall have a credit rating of at least BB+, as
provided by SandP, and Ba1, as provided by Moodys, or a comparable rating from
another nationally-recognized credit rating agency if either SandP or Moodys
has ceased to be in the business of providing such credit ratings.

(ii) As to the Options only, all filing, approval and other requirements
of FERC in connection with the Companys performance of its obligations under
the applicable Precedent Agreement shall have been satisfied, including any
requirements related to the development, construction and operation of any
expansion of the current facilities comprising the Pipeline necessary for the
Company to provide the incremental service contemplated in the applicable
Precedent Agreement.

(iii) As to the Options only, all filing, approval and other requirements of
the Companys Gas Tariff in connection with the Companys performance of its
obligations under the applicable Precedent Agreement shall have been
satisfied, including any requirements related to the development, construction
and operation of any expansion of the current facilities comprising the
Pipeline necessary for the Company to provide the incremental service
contemplated in the applicable Precedent Agreement, including any FERC
regulation that may require the Company to hold an open-season for such
capacity.

(iv) Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be in default under
this Agreement or any other contract between the Seller or any of its
Affiliates and the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. 

(h) None of the Options nor EQTs rights under _Section 1.8(d)_ shall be
assignable. 

Section 1.9 _Release of Capacity._

 

(a) The parties and EQT acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement
or in the Precedent Agreement is intended to restrict EQTs or its
Affiliates ability to release some or all of its firm capacity on the
Pipeline on a temporary basis under the capacity release provisions set forth
in the Companys FERC Gas Tariff, and the Buyer hereby confirms that it will
not restrict EQTs or its Affiliates ability to implement such releases of
capacity provided that each such release is consistent with the Companys FERC
Gas Tariff at the time of the release.

 



9 (b) The parties and EQT acknowledge and agree that a FERC-
regulated interstate pipeline company is only required to allow a permanent
release of firm capacity on its pipeline system when the pipeline company will
be financially indifferent to the release ( _see Transcontinental Gas Pipeline
Corp_., 126 FERC ¶ 61,086, at P 7 (2009); _Texas Eastern Transmission Corp._
, 82 FERC ¶ 61,118 _order on reh g_, 83 FERC ¶ 61,092 (1998)), and if the
Company chooses to make a filing with FERC to modify the Companys FERC
Gas Tariff to include the following provision with respect to requests for
permanent releases of firm capacity on the Pipeline, EQT agrees that it will
not oppose (and that it will cause each of its Affiliates to not oppose) such
filing: "Big Sandy may refuse to allow a permanent capacity release if it has
a reasonable basis to conclude that it will not be financially indifferent to
the release."

termination of, or cancellation or reduction in rights of the Company under
any contract providing for the license of any Intellectual Property to the
Company, the Transferred Business or the Transferred Assets except for any

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER

 

The Buyer hereby represents and warrants to the Seller as follows which
representations and warranties the Buyer agrees shall be true and correct as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date:

Section 3.1 _Organization and Existence._  

The Buyer is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
partnership power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

Section 3.2 _Authority and Approval._

The Buyer has full partnership power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform all of the terms and conditions hereof to be performed by it. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the performance of all of the terms and
conditions hereof to be performed by the Buyer have been duly authorized and
approved by all requisite partnership action of the Buyer. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Buyer and constitutes its valid and
legally binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and remedies
generally and by general principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding
at law or in equity).

 

Section 3.3 _No Conflict; Consents._

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Buyer does
not, and the fulfillment and compliance with the terms and conditions hereof
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i)
violate, conflict with any of, result in any breach of the terms, conditions
or provisions of the certificates of formation, partnership agreements or
equivalent governing instruments of the Buyer; (ii) subject to compliance
with any applicable requirements under the HSR Act, conflict with or violate
any provision of any law or administrative rule or regulation or any judicial,
administrative or arbitration order, award, judgment, writ, injunction or
decree applicable to the Buyer or any property or asset of the Buyer; (iii)
result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, or require any consent
under, any indenture, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Buyer is a party or by which 

 



21  the Buyer or any of its property may be bound or (iv) give rise to any right
of first refusal, preferential purchase right or similar right in any third
party to purchase the Membership Interests or all or any portion of the
Transferred Assets or Transferred Business.

Section 3.5 _Investment Representation._

The Buyer is purchasing the Membership Interests for its own account with the
present intention of holding the Membership Interests for investment purposes
and not with a view to or for sale, in connection with any public
distribution, of the Membership Interests in violation of any federal or state
securities Laws. The Buyer has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Membership Interests. The Buyer acknowledges that the
Membership Interests have not been registered under applicable federal and
state securities Laws. The Buyer further acknowledges that the Membership
Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale, assignment,
pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is registered under applicable
federal and state securities Laws or pursuant to an exemption from
registration under any federal or state securities Laws. The Buyer can bear

financial condition, to hold the Membership Interests for an
indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of the Buyers
investment.

the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Business, the Conveyance, this
Agreement, the exhibits and disclosure schedules attached hereto and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as well as the Companys business,
management and financial affairs. The Buyer acknowledges that any business
plans prepared by the Company have been, and continue to be, subject to change
and that any projections included in such business plans or otherwise are
necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of
the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialize or will vary
significantly from actual results. The Buyer also acknowledges that it is
relying solely on its own counsel and not on any statements or
representations of the Seller (other than representations and warranties made
herein or in the Seller Closing Certificate), the Company or their agents for
legal advice with respect to this investment or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.7 _Litigation._

There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Buyers Knowledge, threatened
against or affecting the Buyer that would reasonably be expected to have a
material and adverse impact on the ability of the Buyer to perform its
obligations hereunder, and there are no orders or

 



22  unsatisfied judgment from any Governmental Authority binding upon the Buyer
that would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse impact on the
ability of the Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder.

AGREEMENTS MADE BY BUYER IN THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER HAS NOT MADE, DOES NOT MAKE,

WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, ORAL OR WRITTEN, PAST OR
PRESENT. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER BUYER NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE OR BOUND IN ANY MANNER BY ANY VERBAL OR
WRITTEN STATEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS OR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO BUYER. THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 3.8_ HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED BY THE PARTIES AFTER DUE
CONSIDERATION AND ARE INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE EXCLUSION AND NEGATION OF ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH
RESPECT TO THE BUYER THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO ANY LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN
EFFECT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS,

COVENANTS, RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

Section 4.1 _Operation of the Transferred Assets and Transferred Business._

(a) Except as provided by this Agreement, by the Conveyance or as consented
to in writing by the Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, the Seller shall and shall cause the Company to: 

(i) conduct its business and operations relating to the Transferred Assets and
the Transferred Business in the usual and ordinary course thereof and in
material compliance with applicable Law; and

(ii) preserve, maintain and protect the Transferred Assets and Transferred
Business and operations related thereto as are now being conducted;

 

 _provided, however,_ the Seller shall not, to the extent commercially
unreasonable, be required to make any payments or enter into any contractual
arrangements or understandings to satisfy the foregoing obligations in this
_Section 4.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of an emergency
involving imminent danger to life or property, the Seller or the
Company shall take all action necessary for the preservation or the safety of
the Transferred Assets, for the safety of any persons, or to avoid the
suspension of any

 



23  necessary service to the Transferred Assets without the prior consent of the
Buyer; provided that the Seller shall, or shall cause the Company to, promptly
notify the Buyer of any such actions. 

(b) Except (i) as provided by this Agreement or the Conveyance, or (ii) as
consented to by the Buyer, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, the Seller shall not permit the Company to, and the
Company shall not:

(i) amend the Companys organizational documents;

(ii) liquidate, dissolve, recapitalize or otherwise wind up the Companys
business;

(iii) make any material change in any method of accounting or accounting
principles, practices or policies of the Company, other than those required by

the date hereof, would be scheduled as a Material Contract, or terminate any
Material Contract or amend any Material Contract in any material respect;

Transferred Assets except in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to
the terms of a Material Contract; or

(vi) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.

Section 4.2 _Access and Inspection Indemnity._  

(a) The Seller shall afford the Buyer and its authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to management personnel and
financial, title, tax, corporate and legal materials and all construction,
compliance and operating data and information relating to the Company, the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Business and shall furnish to the
Buyer such other information as it may reasonably request, unless any such
access and disclosure would violate the terms of any agreement to which the
Seller or any of its Affiliates or the Company is bound or any Law.
Such access by the Buyer shall be limited to the Companys normal business
hours, and the Buyers investigation shall be conducted in a manner that
minimizes interference with the operation of the Company, the Transferred
Assets and the Transferred Business. The Buyer at its option may conduct a
Phase I environmental audit of any or all of the Transferred Assets, to the
extent the Seller has authority to permit such an audit, provided that neither
the Buyer nor its representatives shall conduct any testing or sampling on or
with respect to the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing.

(b) If the Buyer exercises rights of access under this section or otherwise
or conducts examinations or inspections under this section or otherwise, then
(i) such access, examination and inspection shall be at the Buyers sole risk,
cost and expense and

 



24  the Buyer waives and releases all claims against the Seller, its Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors,
agents and successors and assigns arising in any way therefrom or in any way
connected therewith or arising in connection with the conduct of its
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents in
connection therewith and (ii) the Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, contractors, agents and successors and assigns from and
against any and all claims, actions, or causes of action for personal injury,
death or damage to property directly attributable to access to or inspection
of the Company, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Business prior to
the Closing by the Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents or representatives in connection with the Buyers
due diligence activities with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than claims, actions, causes of action or Damages attributable to the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of any indemnified party. THE
FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS,
ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION OR DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING
SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR (ii) STRICT LIABILITY.

Section 4.3 _Amendments to Schedules._

The Seller and the Buyer acknowledge that the Buyers inspection of the
records and files of the Company, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred
Business, or further review by the Seller, prior to the Closing may indicate
that some or all of the Disclosure Schedules attached to this Agreement were
not complete or entirely correct at the time of execution of this Agreement.
Accordingly, the Seller and the Buyer agree to revise and amend the Disclosure
Schedules, as needed, so that they will be complete and accurate at
the Closing and shall be given effect as if made on the Closing Date prior to
the Closing, in the event the Closing occurs. It is understood, however, that
such revisions or amendments shall not otherwise be taken into account in
giving effect to (and shall not diminish or affect) any representations,
rights, options, conditions, covenants and obligations of the parties
contained in this Agreement as originally executed unless otherwise mutually
agreed by the parties in writing.

 

Section 4.4 _Cure of Breach._

If any of the Buyers or Sellers representations or warranties is untrue or
shall become untrue between the date of execution of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, or if any of the Buyers or Sellers covenants or agreements to
be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have been
so performed or observed, but if such breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be cured by the Closing and the
other party has not terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, then
such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this
Agreement; provided that any costs or expenses arising out of or relating to
such cure shall be borne solely by the party who committed the breach.

 



25 Section 4.5 _Cooperation; Further Assurances._

 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all approvals,
clearances and consents required by or necessary for the transactions

certain actions may be necessary with respect to the matters and actions
contemplated by this Agreement such as making notifications and obtaining
consents or approvals or other clearances that are material to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each agrees to take
all appropriate action and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and regulations to make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement will require any party hereto, or any of its Affiliates, to hold
separate or make any divestiture not expressly contemplated herein of any
asset or otherwise agree to any restriction on its, or any of its Affiliates,
operations, or other burdensome condition which would in any such case be
material to its, or any of its Affiliates, assets, liabilities or business
in order to obtain any consent or approval or other clearance required by this
Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties shall cooperate with the other in promptly filing any
other necessary applications, reports or other documents with any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and in seeking necessary consultation with
and prompt favorable action by such Governmental Authority. Each party (i)
will promptly notify the other party of any written communication to the
notified party from any Governmental Authority pertaining to this Agreement
or transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to applicable Laws, if
practicable, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the other
partys reasonable comments in its sole discretion, and (ii) agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend.

 

(c) To the extent not obtained or satisfied as of the Closing, the Seller
agrees to continue to use all commercially reasonable efforts and to
cooperate with the Buyers efforts to obtain for the Buyer any required
consents to the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Company, and access
to files, records and data relating to the Company, the Transferred Assets or
the Transferred Business in the possession of third parties. The Seller agrees
to reimburse the Buyer for 50% of all reasonable out of pocket costs or
expenses incurred by the Buyer or the Company in connection with securing any

efforts, and to cooperate, and to cause their respective Affiliates, including
the Company, to cooperate, with one another to cause such events to occur as
soon as reasonably practicable. Commercially reasonable efforts shall include
(without limitation), for purposes of the third sentence of this Section

further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
documents as are reasonably requested by the other party for carrying out the
purposes of this Agreement, or of any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (including, for purposes of clarification, the Conveyance). 

Section 4.6 _Maintenance of Records_. From and after the Closing:

 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer promptly following Closing a copy of any or
all of the data room materials and other books and records relating to the
Transferred Business or operations thereof, including all DOT compliance

possession of the Company or Buyer, _provided however, that_ Seller may
retain (but shall preserve and keep in accordance with the following sentence)
all Big Sandy Documents that do not exclusively or primarily relate to the
Transferred Business or the Company. Seller and its respective Affiliates
shall preserve and keep all Big Sandy Documents not delivered to Buyer on or
before the Closing Date for a period of at least seven years after the Closing

Period, before Seller shall dispose of any Big Sandy Documents, Seller shall
give Buyer at least 90 days prior notice to such effect, and Buyer shall be
given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any
Big Sandy Documents as Buyer may select. Seller shall provide to Buyer, at no
cost or expense to Buyer, access to the Big Sandy Documents as remain in
Sellers possession and access to the properties and employees of Seller and
Sellers Affiliates in each case in connection with matters relating to the
business or operations of the Transferred Business on or before the Closing
Date and asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any claim or dispute
under this Agreement or as to the Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Transferred Business.

Agreement for the Retention Period. The Buyer shall provide the Seller and its
representatives reasonable access to and the right to copy such files and

the Transferred Assets or the

 



27  Transferred Business prior to the Closing Date, (b) preparing any audit of
the books and records of any third Persons relating to the Company, the
Transferred Assets or the Transferred Business prior to the Closing Date or
responding to any audit related to the Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Transferred Business prepared by such third Persons, (c) preparing tax
returns, (d) responding to or disputing any tax audit related to the Company,
the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Business; or (e) asserting,
defending or otherwise dealing with any claim or dispute under this Agreement
or as to the Company, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Business.

If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing, all or any
portion of the Transferred Assets are destroyed or damaged by fire, flood,
earthquake, storm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage,
accident or other casualty of a similar nature or shall be taken by
condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (all of which are herein
called " _Casualty Loss_ "), and the aggregate loss to the Transferred Assets
as a result of such Casualty Loss is less than 15% of the Purchase Price, the
Buyer and Seller shall proceed with the Closing notwithstanding any such
destruction or taking (without reduction of the Purchase Price) and the
Seller shall, at the Closing, pay to the Company all sums paid to the Seller
by third Persons by reason of the destruction, damage or taking of such
Transferred Asset and shall assign, transfer and set over unto the Company all
of the right, title and interest of the Seller in and to any claims against

destruction or taking, including, but not limited to, insurance proceeds.

adjust any amounts payable by reason of any Casualty Loss during the
aforementioned period without first obtaining the written consent of the
Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Assets equal to or exceeding 15% of the Purchase Price, the Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by giving five (5) days prior written notice to the
other party. If the Buyer does not exercise its right to terminate, then the
Buyer and Seller shall proceed with the Closing notwithstanding any such
destruction or taking (without reduction of the Purchase Price) and the Seller
shall, at the Closing, pay to the Company all sums paid to the Seller by
third Persons by reason of the destruction, damage or taking of such
Transferred Asset and shall assign, transfer and set over unto the Company all
of the right, title and interest of the Seller in and to any claims against
or unpaid proceeds or other payments from third Persons arising out of such
destruction or taking, including, but not limited to, insurance proceeds.

referred to in _Section 5.1(f)(i) _at the negotiated rate that applies to
such agreements without complying with the posting and bidding requirements
set forth in the capacity release provisions contained in the Companys FERC
Gas Tariff, such waiver requested to be effective for a reasonable period of
time commencing June 15, 2011, (and the Buyer shall not oppose any such

shall not initiate or support any proceeding before the FERC under Section 5
of the NGA to decrease the rate paid for service for the primary term of such
transportation agreements executed pursuant to _Section 4.17(b) _below the
Negotiated Rate (" _Section 5 Limitation_ "); however, except with respect to
the foregoing, neither the Section 5 Limitation, nor any other provision in
the applicable transportation agreements executed pursuant to _Section
4.17(b) _shall be construed to limit EQTs right under Section 5 of the NGA
to initiate or support a proceeding before the FERC (A) to enforce the rates,
terms, and conditions set forth in such transportation agreements executed
pursuant to  _Section 4.17(b)_; (B) regarding any of the Companys terms of

(a) From and after Closing, the Seller shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates from and against, all Taxes with
respect to the Company, the Transferred Business or the Transferred Assets for
any Seller Period. From and after Closing, the Buyer shall be responsible
for, and shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates from and against, all
other Taxes with respect to the Company, the Transferred Business or the
Transferred Assets. For this purpose, Straddle Period Taxes shall be (i)
allocated based on an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date for
income and franchise Taxes, and (ii) prorated on a daily basis to the period
prior to and including the Closing Date or thereafter for all other
Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) any ad valorem or
property Taxes paid or payable with respect to the Transferred Assets
(including all Kentucky ad valorem or property Taxes payable by the Seller
with respect to the taxable period that includes the Closing Date) shall be
allocated to the Tax period applicable to the ownership of the Transferred
Assets regardless of when such Taxes are assessed, and (ii) any franchise tax
paid or payable 

 



35  with respect to the Company, the Transferred Business or the Transferred
Assets shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income,
operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such tax is measured,
regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable period is
obtained by the payment of such franchise tax. If the Buyer or the Seller is
obligated for Taxes paid by the other party pursuant to this  _Section
6.1(a)_, such party shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of
its obligation therefor, remit a payment in cash to such other party in an
amount equal to such Taxes. Each day thereafter, interest on the amount the
Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, is obligated to pay pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(a)_ shall accrue at the rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 2%,
compounded daily.

 

(b) If the Buyer or its Affiliates receives a refund of any Taxes that the
Seller is responsible for hereunder, or if the Seller or its Affiliates
receive a refund of any Taxes that the Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the
party receiving such refund shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such refund, remit it to the party who has responsibility for such Taxes
hereunder. Each day thereafter, interest on the amount the Buyer or the
Seller, as the case may be, is obligated to pay pursuant to this Section
6.1(b) shall accrue at the rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 2%, compounded daily.
The parties shall reasonably cooperate in order to take all necessary steps
to claim any such refund.

Section 6.2 _Tax Returns._  

(a) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date that is required to be filed after the Closing Date
with respect to the Company, the Transferred Business or the Transferred
Assets, the Seller shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and filed timely
with the appropriate Taxing Authority, and be responsible for the timely
payment (and entitled to any refund) of all Taxes due with respect to the
period covered by such Tax Return.

(b) With respect to any Tax Return covering a Straddle Period that is required
to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the Company, the
Transferred Business or the Transferred Assets, the Seller shall cause such
Tax Return to be prepared, furnish a copy of such Tax Return to the Buyer,
file timely such Tax Return with the appropriate Taxing Authority, and be
responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to
the period covered by such Tax Return (but shall have a right to recover the
amount of Taxes attributable to the portion of the taxable period allocable to
the Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_).

 

(c) Any Tax Return not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the
Closing Date with respect to the Company, the Transferred Business or the
Transferred Assets shall be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting
practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in question (unless such past
practices are no longer permissible by Law), and to the extent any items are
not covered by past practices, in accordance with reasonable Tax accounting
practices selected by the filing party with respect to such Tax Return under
this Agreement with the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of the non-filing party.

 



36 Section 6.3 _Tax Audits._

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, each of the Buyer and the Seller, as
applicable (the " _Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify the chief tax
officer (and the notice party as set forth in _Section 9.2_ of this
Agreement) of the other party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Person_ "), in writing
within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person of written
notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, claims, examinations,
assessments or other proceedings with respect to the Company, the Transferred
Business or the Transferred Assets (a " _Tax Audit_ ") which may affect the
liability for Taxes of such other party. If the Tax Indemnified Person fails
to give such timely notice to the other party, it shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to
the extent such failure to give notice materially adversely affects the other
partys right to participate or meaningfully defend in the Tax Audit.

 

(b) If a Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which only the Seller would be liable
to indemnify the Buyer under this Agreement, the Seller shall have the
option, at its expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax
Audit. If the Seller does not elect to control the defense and settlement of
such Tax Audit by giving written notice of to the Buyer within fifteen (15)
days of the receipt of the first notice of such audit (and failure to give
such timely notice shall constitute a waiver of the Sellers right to elect
not to control and defend the audit), the Buyer may, at the Buyers
expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit, provided that
the Seller shall pay any Tax for which it is otherwise liable under _Section
6.1_. If such Tax Audit relates solely to Taxes for which only the Buyer would
be liable under this Agreement, the Buyer shall, at its expense, control the
defense and settlement of such Tax Audit to the extent that such Tax Audit
relates to Taxes for which the Buyer is liable to indemnify the Seller under
_Section 6.1_.

 

(c) If a Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both the Seller and the Buyer
could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, the items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit or other item required to be reported
on or otherwise reported on the applicable Tax Return (" _Tax Items_ ") with
respect to such Tax Audit will be distinguished and each party will have the
option to control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so
liable. If such Tax Audit relates to a Straddle Period and any Tax Item cannot
be identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated
from a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, the Seller, at its
expense, shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of the
Tax Audit, provided that the Seller defend the items as reported on the
relevant Tax Return and provided further that no such matter shall be settled
without the written consent of the Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.

(d) Any party whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall
be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense and shall have the right to consent to
any settlement of such Tax Audit (not to be unreasonably withheld) to the
extent that such settlement would have an adverse effect with respect to a
period for which that party is liable for Taxes, under this 

 



37  Agreement or otherwise.

Section 6.4 _Pre- and Post-Closing Actions; Post-Closing Assistance._

(a) Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, the Seller shall not
and shall not permit its Affiliates to take any action (including the
amendment of any Tax Return) on or before the Closing Date which could
reasonably be expected to materially increase the Buyers liability for Taxes
(including any liability of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller for Taxes under
this Agreement). Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, the Buyer
shall not and shall not permit its Affiliates to take any action (including
the amendment of any Tax Return) on or after the Closing Date which could
reasonably be expected to materially increase the Sellers liability for Taxes
(including any liability of the Seller to indemnify the Buyer for Taxes under
this Agreement).

 

(b) Following the Closing, the Seller and the Buyer will each provide the
other such reasonable assistance, at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting party, as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return with respect to the Company, the Transferred
Business or the Transferred Assets, or any Tax Audit, and each party
will retain and provide the requesting party with any records or information
that may be reasonably relevant to such return, audit or examination,
proceedings or determination. The party requesting assistance will reimburse
the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (other than salaries or
wages of any employees of the parties) incurred in providing such assistance.

 

Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes._

The Buyer and the Seller agree that each shall be liable for fifty percent
(50%) of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
similar taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") and fees arising out of or in connection
with the transactions effected pursuant to (i) the Contribution Agreement,
whether incurred on or before Closing and (ii) this Agreement. The Buyer and
the Seller shall cooperate to file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes and fees arising out of or in
connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. If
either the Buyer or the Seller is required by Law to pay or remit such
Transfer Taxes and fees, the other party shall promptly reimburse the Buyer or
the Seller, as applicable, for fifty percent (50%) of such Transfer Taxes and
fees.

Section 6.6 _Final Purchase Price Allocation._

The parties acknowledge that the purchase and sale of the Membership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as a purchase and sale of
the Transferred Assets for federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of
any applicable state taxes that follow the federal treatment). Not later than
90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall determine in consultation with
the Seller and deliver to the Seller an allocation of the consideration paid
(or treated as paid) for the Transferred Assets among such assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Except with respect to any payments
of interest under _Section 1.2(f)_ and as otherwise as required by Law, any
payments from one party to the other under this Agreement after the
Closing Date shall be treated as an adjustment to the consideration paid for
the Transferred

 



38  Assets for federal income tax purposes, and the Buyer shall revise the
allocation described previously as appropriate and deliver the revised
allocation to the Seller. If the parties cannot agree on either the initial
allocation or any adjusted allocation within 30 days of the provision of such
allocation, the parties will resolve the dispute in accordance with Section
1.2(e). The parties agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with such
original or any revised allocation, including the filing of Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594, and not to take any position inconsistent therewith, except
as required by Law.

 

Section 6.7 _Like-Kind Exchange._

The Buyer and the Seller hereby agree that either party, at its sole expense,
may elect a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller, at its expense,
shall have the right at any time prior to the Closing to assign all or a
portion of its rights under this Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" (as
that term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii))
or an "exchange accommodation titleholder" (as that term is defined in Revenue
Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308) in order to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby at such Closing in a manner that will qualify, either in
whole or in part, as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code.
Likewise, the Buyer, at its expense, shall have the right at any time prior to
the Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement to
a qualified intermediary or an exchange accommodation titleholder for the same
purpose. In the event that either party assigns its rights under this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.7_, such party agrees to notify the
other party in writing of such assignment on or before the Closing
attributable to such rights. The Buyer and the Seller agree to cooperate to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party in order to effectuate the
transactions contemplated hereby as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031
of the Code. The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge and agree that any
assignment of rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary or an
exchange accommodation titleholder shall not release either party from any of
its liabilities and obligations to the other party under this Agreement, and
that neither party represents to the other party that any particular Tax
treatment will be given to any party as a result thereof. In no event will
either party be liable to the other for any failure of any transaction to
qualify for like-kind treatment under Section 1031 of the Code.

Section 6.8 _Survival._

Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights and obligations of
the parties hereto with respect to any Tax matter covered by this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate until the expiration of the
applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods of extension and
tolling) applicable to such Tax matter.

 

Section 6.9 _Conflict._

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this _Article VI_ and any
other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this _Article VI_ shall
control.

 



39 ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 _Events of Termination._

 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the parties;

 

(b) by the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, in
writing after October 31, 2011, if the Closing has not occurred by such date,
provided that as of such date no breach by the terminating party under this
Agreement has prevented the consummation of the Closing;

 

(c) by the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, in
writing without prejudice to other rights and remedies that the terminating
party or its Affiliates may have (provided the terminating party and its
Affiliates are not otherwise in material default or breach of this Agreement,
or have not failed or refused to close without justification hereunder), if
the other party has breached or failed to perform in any respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein and such
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of
a condition to such terminating partys obligation to close specified in
_Article V_ , (ii) cannot be cured or has not been cured within ten (10) days
following delivery of written notice from the non-defaulting party of such
breach of this Agreement and (iii) has not been waived by the non-defaulting
party;

(d) by the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, in
writing, without liability, if there shall be any order, writ, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Authority binding on any of the parties, which
prohibits or restrains them from consummating the transactions contemplated
hereby, provided that the parties shall have used their commercially
reasonable efforts to have any such order, writ, injunction or decree lifted
and the same shall not have been lifted within thirty (30) days after entry
by any such Governmental Authority;

(e) by the Seller if any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 5.2_ have
become incapable of fulfillment, and have not been waived in writing by the
Seller;

 

(f) by the Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ have
become incapable of fulfillment, and have not been waived in writing by the
Buyer; or

(g) by Buyer as provided in _Section 4.7_. 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination._

If a party terminates this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, such
termination shall be without liability and none of the provisions of this
Agreement shall remain effective or enforceable, except for those contained
in this _Section 7.2_ and _Article IX_ and the Buyers obligations pursuant
to _Section 4.2(b)_. Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in
the 

 



40  event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or if
any party is otherwise in breach of this Agreement, such termination shall not
relieve such breaching party of any liability for a willful breach of any
representation, covenant or agreement under this Agreement or be deemed a
waiver of any available remedy (including specific performance, if available)
for any such breach.

 

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION UPON CLOSING

Section 8.1 _Indemnification of the Buyer._

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Seller, from and
after the Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer, its
Affiliates (including the Company) and their respective, directors, officers,
and employees (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against
any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party as a
result of or arising out of (a) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of the Seller in this Agreement or the Seller Closing Certificate,
(b) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of the Seller made
under this Agreement, (c) the Seller Pre-Closing Liabilities, (d) any
Indebtedness not taken into account in connection with the adjustment of the
Purchase Price under _Section 1.2_ and (e) all Mineral Owner Obligations.
For purposes of this _Section 8.1_, whether the Seller has breached any of
its representations and warranties herein, and the determination and
calculation of any Damages resulting form such breach, shall be determined
without giving effect to any qualification as to "materiality" (including the
word "material" or "Material Adverse Effect").

Section 8.2 _Indemnification of the Seller._

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, and employees (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")
harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any
Seller Indemnified Party as a result of or arising out of (a) any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Buyer in this Agreement or
the Buyer Closing Certificate or (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant
on the part of the Buyer made under this Agreement. For purposes of this
_Section 8.2_, whether the Buyer has breached any of its representations and
warranties herein, and the determination and calculation of any Damages
resulting form such breach, shall be determined without giving effect to any
qualification as to "materiality" (including the word "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect").

 

Section 8.3 _Survival._

All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
party hereto, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Articles II_ and _III_ and in any certificate delivered in connection
herewith with respect to any of those representations and warranties shall
terminate and expire on the date that is eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date, except (a) the representations and warranties of the Seller
set forth in _Sections 2.10_ and _2.14_ shall survive until 60 days after the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods
of 

 



41  extension and tolling), (b) the representations and warranties of the Seller
set forth in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.4_ , _2.13(e)_ and _2.18_ shall
survive forever, (c) the representations and warranties of the Seller set
forth in _Section 2.6(a)_ and _2.11_ shall survive until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date and (d) the representations and warranties of
the Buyer set forth in  _Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ shall survive forever. After
a representation and warranty has terminated and expired, no indemnification
shall or may be sought pursuant to this _Article VIII_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty by any Person who would have been entitled
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ to indemnification on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration, provided
that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall terminate and
expire as provided in this _Section 8.3_, no claim presented in writing for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall be
affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The indemnification
obligations under this _Article VIII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
apply REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY SUIT OR ACTION RESULTS SOLELY OR IN PART FROM
THE ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY. The covenants and agreements entered into pursuant to this
Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.

 

Section 8.4 _Demands._

(a) Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its discovery
of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim,
action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such claims
for indemnity involving third party claims being collectively referred to
herein as the " _Indemnity Claim_ "), with respect to any matter as to which
it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement,
it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party,
together with a statement of such information respecting any of the
foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a formal demand for
indemnification under this Agreement.

(b) If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying
party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in
sufficient time to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend
against an Indemnity Claim and to make a timely response thereto, the
indemnifying partys indemnity obligation relating to such Indemnity Claim
shall be limited to the extent that such failure has actually prejudiced or
damaged the indemnifying party with respect to that Indemnity Claim.

Section 8.5 _Right to Contest and Defend._

 

(a) The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to
contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim
for which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the
provisions of this Agreement; provided, that notice of the intention to so
contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party
within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of
notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any
such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the 

 



42  indemnifying party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such
contest shall be conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying
party and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the
indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate
in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at
its sole cost and expense.

 

(b) The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action
to be taken with respect thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified
party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely
ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense or injunctive
relief. If the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity
Claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with
respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely
affect the indemnified party as determined by the indemnified party in its
sole discretion.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party
in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages.

 

Section 8.6 _Cooperation._

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any
Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the
Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.

 



43 Section 8.7 _Right to Participate._

 

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim
against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or
counsel for such Persons.

 

Section 8.8 _Payment of Damages._

The indemnification required hereunder in respect of Indemnity Claims shall be
made by periodic payments of the amount of Damages in connection therewith,
within ten (10) days as and when reasonably specific bills are received by,
or Damages are incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered to, the
indemnifying party. In calculating any amount to be paid by an indemnifying
party by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, the amount shall be
reduced by all insurance proceeds and any indemnification reimbursement
proceeds received from third parties credited to or received by the
indemnified party related to the Damages.

 

Section 8.9 _Limitations on Indemnification._

 

(a) To the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_, the
Seller shall be liable only if (i) the Damages with respect to a claim exceed
$10,000 (the " _Minimum Claim Amount_ ") and (ii) the Damages for all claims
that exceed the Minimum Claim Amount exceed, in the aggregate, 0.5% of the
Purchase Price (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and then the Seller shall be
liable only for Damages to the extent of any excess over the Deductible
Amount. In no event shall the Sellers aggregate liability to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.1(a)_ exceed 20% of the Purchase Price
(the " _Ceiling Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Deductible
Amount shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of representations and
warranties contained in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.4_ , _2.6(a)_ , _2.10_ ,
_2.13(e)_ and _2.18_ (the " _Fundamental R andWs_") and (ii) the Ceiling
Amount shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental RandWs;
_provided_ , that the Sellers aggregate liability for a breach or inaccuracy
of any Fundamental RandW shall not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price
minus the amount of all other Damages payable by the Seller hereunder.

(b) To the extent the Seller Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled
to indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, the Buyer shall
be liable only if (i) the Damages with respect to a claim exceed the Minimum
Claim Amount and (ii) the Damages for all claims that exceed the Minimum
Claim Amount exceed, in the aggregate, the Deductible Amount, and then the
Buyer shall be liable only for Damages to the extent of any excess over the
Deductible Amount. In no event shall the Buyers aggregate liability to the
Seller Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.2(a)_ exceed the Ceiling Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Amount and the Ceiling Amount
shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , and _3.4_.

 



44 (c) Additionally, neither the Buyer, on the one hand, nor the Seller, on
the other hand, will be liable as an indemnitor under this Agreement for any
consequential, incidental, special, indirect or exemplary damages suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party or parties except to the extent resulting
pursuant to Indemnity Claims.

Section 8.10 _Sole Remedy._

Should the Closing occur, no party shall have liability under this Agreement,
any other document, agreement, certificate or other matter delivered pursuant
hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby except as is provided in
_Article VI_ , this _Article VIII_ or _Section 9.13_ (other than claims or
causes of action arising from fraud).

ARTICLE IX

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL
INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING
WITHOUT A JURY.

 

Section 9.5 _Confidentiality; Public Statements._

Until the Closing, the parties shall keep confidential and cause their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives to keep confidential all information relating to this
Agreement, the Company, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Business,
except as required by applicable Laws, administrative process or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange to which such party or its Affiliates
are subject, and except for information which is available to the public on
the date hereof or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a
result of a breach of this Section 9.5 by such party or any such other Person.
No party shall make any press release or other public announcement regarding
the existence of this Agreement (or any documents contemplated by this
Agreement), the contents hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby without the prior written consent of the other party;
_provided, however_ , the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by the
Buyer or the Seller (a) that are mutually agreed to in writing, (b) that are
required by applicable securities or other Laws or applicable rules of any
stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing party or its
Affiliates, or (c) to Governmental Authorities and third Persons holding
consents that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (or any documents contemplated by this Agreement), as
reasonably necessary to obtain waivers of such consents.

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers._

This Agreement, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended or modified from time
to time only by the written agreement of both parties. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor
shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

 

Section 9.7 _Binding Effect and Assignment._

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned or transferred by any party hereto without the prior written consent
of the other party. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or
obligations hereunder.

 



47 Section 9.8 _Severability._

 

If any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to contravene, or to be invalid under, the laws of any political
body having jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, such contravention or
invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Instead, this Agreement
shall be construed as if it did not contain the particular provision or
provisions held to be invalid, and an equitable adjustment shall be made and
necessary provision added so as to give effect to the intention of the parties
as expressed in this Agreement at the time of execution of this Agreement, but
all of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect.

Section 9.9 _Interpretation._

 

It is expressly agreed by the parties that this Agreement shall not be
construed against any party, and no consideration shall be given or
presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any provision
hereof or who supplied the form of this Agreement. Each party agrees that this
Agreement has been purposefully drawn and correctly reflects its understanding
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, therefore, waives the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 9.10 _Headings._

 

All Article and Section headings in this Agreement are for convenience only
and shall not be deemed to control or affect the meaning or construction of
any of the provisions hereof. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All references herein to Articles and Sections shall, unless the context
requires a different construction, be deemed to be references to the Articles
and Sections of this Agreement, respectively. All Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof
for all purposes, and unless the context expressly requires otherwise, such
Disclosure Schedules and such Exhibits are incorporated in the definition
of "Agreement." All personal pronouns used in this Agreement, whether used in
the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, shall include all other genders, and
the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. The use herein of the
word "including" following any general statement, term or matter shall not be
construed to limit such statement, term or matter to the specific items or
matters set forth immediately following such word or to similar items or
matters, whether or not non-limiting language (such as "without limitation,"
"but not limited to," or words of similar import) is used with reference
thereto, but rather shall be deemed to refer to all other items or matters
that could reasonably fall within the broadest possible scope of such general
statement, term or matter.

Section 9.11 _Multiple Counterparts; Electronic Signature._

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
together shall constitute one agreement binding on the parties hereto.
Execution of this

 



48  Agreement by an electronic form of signature that is an exact copy of the
original signature shall be deemed to be, and shall have the same effect as,
execution by original signature, and an electronic form counterpart of this
Agreement signed by all parties hereto shall be sufficient to bind all such
parties.

 

Section 9.12 _Disclosure Schedules._

The Disclosure Schedules are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Seller except
as and to the extent specifically provided in this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes an admission that any
information disclosed, set forth or incorporated by reference herein and
therein is required by the terms of this Agreement to be so disclosed,
set forth or incorporated. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is intended to
imply that the amounts, higher or lower amounts, the items included or any
other items, are or are not material, and the Buyer shall not use the fact of
the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in
the Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item, matter or dollar amount (a) is or is not
material or may constitute an event or condition that could be considered to
have had, or that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (b) is or is not in the ordinary
course of business and/or consistent with past practice. Matters disclosed for
the purpose of one section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall
not constitute disclosure of such matters for the purposes of other sections
or subsections of this Agreement. Headings have been provided for the sections
of the Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only and shall to no
extent have the effect of amending or changing any express description of the
sections set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.13  _Specific Enforcement._

The parties acknowledge that, in view of the uniqueness of the Transferred
Business and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Buyer and the Seller
will not have an adequate remedy at Law for money damages in the event that
this Agreement has not been performed in accordance with its terms by the
other party, and therefore, the parties agree that the Buyer or the Seller,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to specific enforcement of the terms
hereof with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation to compel a party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in order to effect the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement) in the event of breach by the other party in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties may be entitled, at Law or
in equity, for such breach. In addition, the parties agree that any breach of
any covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement by the Seller may
cause the Buyer irreparable injury and damage. The Seller, therefore,
expressly agrees that the Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive and/or
other equitable relief to prevent an anticipatory or continuing breach and to
secure enforcement of any part of such covenants or agreements. Nothing herein
shall be construed as a waiver by the Buyer or the Seller of any right each
may now have or hereafter acquire to monetary damages from the other party by
reason of any injury to its property, or otherwise arising out of any breach
or any otherwise wrongful act or omission by such party. 

 



49 Section 9.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._

 

Nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any third party or
entitle any third party to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any
kind, it being the intent of the parties that this Agreement shall not be
construed as a third party beneficiary contract; _provided, however_ , that
the indemnification provisions in Article VIII shall inure to the benefit
of Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties as provided
herein.

Section 9.15 _Seller Parent Guaranty._  

(a) EQT hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all obligations of
the Seller now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, including _Section
1.7_ and _Article VIII_, and any and all expenses (including reasonable
counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Buyer in enforcing any rights under
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Seller Obligations_ ").

(b) EQT guarantees that the Seller Obligations will be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any Law, regulation
or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such
terms or the rights of the Seller with respect thereto. The liability of EQT
under this _Section 9.15_ shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of
(i) any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto, (ii)
any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term
of, all or any of the Seller Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of
or any consent to departure from this Agreement, (iii) any release
or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty,
for all or any of the Seller Obligations; or (iv) any other circumstance which
might otherwise constitute a defense available to or a discharge of the Seller
or EQT. 

(c) The guaranty set forth in this _Section 9.15_ shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of
any of the Seller Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
the Buyer upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Seller or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. EQT hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect
to any of the Seller Obligations and this guaranty. EQT hereby irrevocably
waives any claims or other rights that it may now or hereafter acquire
against the Buyer that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of EQTs obligations under this guaranty or this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in

(i) EQTs long-term senior unsecured debt is currently rated by Moodys and

EQTs long-term senior unsecured debt, EQT shall replace that rating agency
with another nationally-recognized rating agency (A) immediately, in the event
EQT elects to no longer be rated by Moodys or SandP and (B) within fifteen (15)
days after it is no longer rated, in the event EQT is dropped by either
Moodys or SandP or Moodys or SandP is no longer a nationally-recognized rating
agency. If EQTs long-term senior unsecured debt is rated by only one
nationally-recognized rating agency (subject to EQTs right to secure a
second rating agency as provided above), EQT shall provide the Buyer with (A)
a $30,000,000 Letter of Credit provided EQTs long-term senior unsecured debt

rating agency. If EQTs long-term senior unsecured debt is not rated by any
nationally-recognized rating agency, EQT shall provide the Buyer with (A) an
additional Letter of Credit with a face amount of $20,000,000, if a
$30,000,000 EQT LC is already outstanding or (B) a $30,000,000 Letter of

then the EQT LC(s) shall be returned to EQT within five (5) business days
after receipt by the Buyer of a written request by EQT, subject to EQTs
obligations under _Section 9.15(f)(ii)_ below. If, at any time after EQT has
delivered to the Buyer EQT LC(s) in the aggregate amount of $50,000,000 under
this _Section 9.15(f)(i)_ due to EQTs failure to be rated by two nationally-
recognized rating agencies, EQT is rated by a single nationally recognized
rating agency above Below Investment Grade, then the Buyer shall return the
$20,000,000 Letter of Credit to EQT and retain the $30,000,000 EQT LC, in
either case, within five (5) business days after receipt by the Buyer of a
written request by EQT, and in each case subject to EQTs obligations under
_Section 9.15(f)(ii)_ below.

 



51 (ii) If at any time after the Closing Date EQTs long-term senior unsecured
debt rating falls below either BBB-, as provided by SandP, or Baa3, as provided
by Moodys (or in the event a replacement agency has been designated pursuant
to _Section 9.15(f)(i)_, a comparable rating by the replacement agency), EQT
shall provide the Buyer with a Letter of Credit with a face amount of
$30,000,000. Additionally, if at any time after the Closing Date EQT has a
credit rating of Below Investment Grade, EQT shall provide the Buyer with (A)
an additional Letter of Credit with a face amount of $20,000,000, if a
$30,000,000 EQT LC is already outstanding or (B) a Letter of Credit in the
face amount of $50,000,000 if no EQT LC is then outstanding. If at any time
after having provided to the Buyer EQT LCs in an aggregate face amount of
$50,000,000 under this _Section 9.15(f)(ii)_, EQT is no longer Below
Investment Grade, then an EQT LC in the face amount of $20,000,000 shall be
returned to EQT within 5 business days after receipt by the Buyer of a
written request by EQT and _further_ , if at any time while an EQT LC under
this Section 9.15(f)(ii) is outstanding, EQTs long-term senior unsecured debt
rating is at least both BBB-, as provided by SandP, and Baa3, as provided by
Moodys (or in the event a replacement agency has been designated pursuant to
_Section 9.15(f)(i)_, a comparable rating by the replacement agency), any
remaining EQT LC shall be returned to EQT within 5 business days after
receipt by the Buyer of a written request by EQT.

(iii) EQT shall provide each Letter of Credit to the Buyer within 5 business
days after the occurrence of the event requiring delivery of the applicable
Letter of Credit. The Buyer may require EQT, at no cost to the Buyer, to
replace an EQT LC if the financial institution having provided such EQT LC
ceases, at any time, to be a Qualified Financial Institution. EQT shall
provide a replacement EQT LC to the Buyer within 5 business days after receipt
by EQT of such written request by the Buyer.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (A) this Agreement,
(B) the transportation agreements entered into pursuant to _Sections
5.1(f)(i)_ , _5.1(f)(ii)_ , _4.17(b)_ or (C) any transportation agreements
entered into pursuant to an exercise of the Options or EQTs rights under
_Section 1.8(d)_, in no event will the aggregate amount of the EQT LCs
outstanding at any point exceed $50,000,000.

(v) The Buyer shall have the right to draw against any EQT LC upon any
default by EQT, the Seller or its Affiliates in the performance of any of
their obligations under this _Section 9.15_, the transportation agreements
entered into in connection with the Options or the exercise of EQTs rights
under _Section 1.8(d)_ (the " _Obligations_ "), and apply any proceeds from
such draw to satisfy the Obligations.
