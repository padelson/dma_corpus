by such holder under Section 3.4(a) following surrender (or deemed surrender)
of the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares of Company 
Capital Stock and the delivery to the Paying Agent by such Company Stockholder
of (i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit H_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), duly executed and completed
in  accordance with the instructions thereto; (ii) completed IRS Forms W-8
and/or W-9, if applicable; and (iii) such other documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Paying Agent. If such Certificate or Certificates are
surrendered (or deemed  surrendered), and such Letter of Transmittal and IRS
Forms W-8 and/or W-9, if applicable, are delivered, at least three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, then Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative shall instruct the Paying Agent  to pay such dollar amount to
such holder by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the Closing. If
such Certificate or Certificates are surrendered (or deemed surrendered), and
such Letter of Transmittal and IRS Forms W-8 and/or W-9, if  applicable, are

and the Securityholders' Representative shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay
such dollar amount to such holder by wire transfer of immediately  available
funds within three Business Days after such surrender (or deemed surrender)
and delivery. Each such Certificate so surrendered (or deemed surrendered)
shall be canceled. Until surrendered (or deemed surrendered) as contemplated
by  this Section 3.4(e), each such Certificate shall be deemed after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive (following such
surrender or deemed surrender) the consideration receivable pursuant to
Section 3.4(a) with respect to the  shares of Company Capital Stock
previously represented by such Certificate.

 

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or  destroyed, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.4(e) or
Section 3.4(f), upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the presentation
of  such affidavit (and delivery of a duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal and IRS Forms W-8 and/or W-9, if applicable) to the Paying Agent,
Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall instruct the Paying Agent
to pay to such  Person the consideration receivable with respect to the
Company Capital Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

 


 

 

 

20  


 

 

(g) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent, as soon as  reasonably
practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in any
event within three Business Days after the date hereof), to mail or otherwise
deliver a Letter of Transmittal (and IRS Form W-9) to each holder of record
of  shares of Company Capital Stock. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the cash amount payable upon the surrender (or deemed surrender) of any
Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment
equal to the  applicable cash amount is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate (or Certificate that is deemed
to have been surrendered) formerly evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock
is registered on the stock  transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered (or so deemed
surrendered) shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment  shall have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable
cash amount to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate,
or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes 
either have been paid or are not applicable.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,  neither the
delivery nor surrender of Certificates shall be required under Section 3.4(e)
(nor shall any affidavit be required under Section 3.4(f) in the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed) as a condition for
receipt  of any payment or for any other reason, so long as the holder of
such Certificates validly completes and submits a Letter of Transmittal,
including via online submission, in which case the underlying Certificates
covered by such Letter of  Transmittal shall be deemed automatically
surrendered and cancelled.

 

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the  contrary, if
required by the DGCL, but only to the extent required thereby, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration
described in Section 3.4(a), and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall only
be  entitled to receive such rights as are provided in accordance with the
DGCL and any other applicable Law unless and until such holders fail to
perfect or withdraw or otherwise lose such rights under the DGCL and any other
applicable Law. If,  after the Effective Time, any such holder of Dissenting
Shares fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such
right, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be automatically
treated as if they had been converted into  and have become exchangeable for,
at the Effective Time, the right to receive the consideration described in
Section 3.4(a), without any interest thereon (subject to the surrender of
their Certificate representing such Dissenting Shares and other  requirements
set forth in Section 3.4(e)). The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub
prompt notice of any demands for dissenters' rights and withdrawals of demands
for dissenters' rights. Parent will have the right to participate in all 
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for dissenters' rights or settle or offer
to settle any  such demand.

Plan_.

Parent. Each Company Option shall be irrevocably cancelled and terminated
without consideration immediately prior to, but subject to the closing of, the
Merger, without any action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub.

 

 

(b) Each Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time
shall be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, and no consideration
shall be paid therefor.

 

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Board  of
Directors of the Company, or the applicable committee thereof, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to (i)
effectuate the provisions of Section 3.5(a) and Section 3.5(b) and (ii) cause
the Company  Equity Plans and the Company Warrants to terminate at or prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver
all notices, if any, that are required under the Company Equity Plans or the
Company Warrants (which  notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its
reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company Options or Company Warrants.

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall  cancel and
terminate the Bonus Plan, and all rights and obligations outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Bonus Plan shall be thereby
cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time. Subject to
the  completion, execution and delivery by each Bonus Plan Participant of a
Bonus Plan Termination Agreement, each Bonus Plan Participant's rights under
the Bonus Plan shall be converted into the right to receive (subject to
applicable Tax  withholding): (i) an amount in cash equal to the Bonus Plan
Closing Payment; plus (ii) an amount equal to the product of (A) the Bonus
Participant's Pro Rata Share multiplied     by (B) any cash disbursements
made from the Escrow Fund to the Company Stockholders and Bonus Plan
Participants in accordance with Section 11.5 (and otherwise in each case in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) (as and when such  disbursements are
made); plus (iii) such amount equal to any payments made by Parent with
respect to such Bonus Plan Participant in accordance with Section 3.6(e)(i)(B)
(as and when such payments are  made); plus (iv) an amount equal to the
product of (A) the Bonus Participant's Pro Rata Share multiplied by (B) any
amount paid over to the Paying Agent by the  Securityholders' Representative
(for further distribution to the Company Stockholders and Bonus Plan
Participants) in accordance with Section 13.3(i)(B) (as and when such
disbursements are made). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to 
pay, through the Surviving Corporation's (or its applicable Affiliate's)
standard payroll or accounts payable system, as applicable, each Bonus Plan
Participant the aggregate dollar amount receivable by such Person under
Section 3.5(d)(i)  following the delivery to the Company of a duly executed
Bonus Plan Termination Agreement.

 

 

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Board  of
Directors of the Company, or the applicable committee thereof, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to (i)
effectuate the provisions of Section 3.5(d) and (ii) cause the Bonus Plan to
terminate at or  prior to the Effective Time.

Parent any objections that it has to any of the matters set forth therein. If
the Securityholders' Representative does not deliver any written objections 
to Parent within such 90-day period, the Securityholders' Representative (on
behalf of the Indemnifying Persons) shall be deemed to have accepted the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the calculations set forth
therein. If the  Securityholders' Representative does timely deliver such
written objections (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), which Dispute Notice specifies in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted
(collectively, the " _Disputed    Items_ "), then, during the 45 days
following Parent's receipt of the Dispute Notice, Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall in good faith attempt to resolve in
writing the Disputed Items. Any Disputed Item resolved in writing  by Parent
and the Securityholders' Representative will be deemed final, binding and
conclusive on Parent and the Indemnifying Persons. Additionally, following
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Parent shall,
and  shall cause the Company to, provide to the Securityholders'
Representative confidential, reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the Company's books and records (including working papers, schedules and
calculations) reasonably  relating to the calculation of the Closing
Statement, including (to the extent practicable) by making any applicable
records available in electronic form where reasonably requested. The
Securityholders' Representative and its advisors may make  inquiries of the
personnel of Parent and the Company that were involved in the preparation of
the Closing Statement regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the
Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and  Parent
and the Company shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with the
Securityholders' Representative and its advisors with respect to such
inquiries.

(d) If Parent and the Securityholders' Representative do not reach  agreement
on all of the Disputed Items during such 45-day period (or such longer period
as they shall mutually agree), then, at the end of such period, Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative will submit all unresolved Disputed Items 
(collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to a mutually agreeable,
independent, nationally recognized accounting firm (the " _Accounting Referee_
") to review and resolve such Unresolved Items. Each of Parent and the
Securityholders'  Representative agrees to execute and deliver any customary
engagement letter reasonably required by the Accounting Referee. The
Accounting Referee will determine each Unresolved Item (the amount of which
may not be more favorable to Parent than  the related amount reflected in the
Closing Statement nor more favorable to the Securityholders' Representative
than the related amount set forth in the Dispute Notice) as promptly as
practicable, and Parent and the Securityholders'  Representative will
instruct the Accounting Referee to endeavor to complete such process within a
period of no more than 45 days. The Accounting Referee may conduct such
proceedings as the Accounting Referee believes, in its sole discretion, will 
assist in the determination of the Unresolved Items; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as Parent and the Securityholders' Representative may otherwise
agree, all communications between Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative  or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand,
and the Accounting Referee, on the other hand, will be in writing with copies
simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating Party. The Accounting
Referee shall make its  determination solely based on (i) the documentation
submitted by, and presentations (any such documentation or presentation must
be provided to the other Party prior to its submission or presentation to the
Accounting Referee) made by Parent and  the Securityholders' Representative,
(ii) the definitions of Closing Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness,
Benefits Liabilities and Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and (iii)
the accounting principles, policies, procedures and  methodologies utilized
by the Company prior to the Closing. The Accounting Referee's determination of
the Unresolved Items will be final, binding and conclusive on Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative and enforceable before a  Governmental
Authority, effective as of the date the Accounting Referee's written
determination is received by Parent and the Securityholders' Representative.
Each of Parent and the Securityholders' Representative (solely on behalf of
the  Indemnifying Persons) will bear its own legal, accounting and other fees
and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee incurred pursuant to this Section
3.6(d) shall be split  equally between Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Persons).

 

 

(e) Upon resolution of all Disputed Items and Unresolved Items  (if any)
pursuant to this Section 3.6, the final amounts of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Date Indebtedness, Benefits Liabilities and Closing Date Company
Transaction Expenses, and the Final Merger Consideration based on the
foregoing, shall  be determined, and the following payments shall be made:

 

 

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration  exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration (an " _Underpayment Amount_ "), then Parent shall promptly (and
in any event within three Business Days) pay (A) to the Paying Agent, for
further distribution to the Company Stockholders, the portion  of such
Underpayment Amount payable to the Company Stockholders, and (B) to the
Surviving Corporation for further distribution, through the Surviving
Corporation's (or its applicable Affiliate's) standard payroll or accounts
payable system, as  applicable, the portion of such Underpayment Amount
payable to the Bonus Plan Participants to be allocated among the Bonus Plan
Participants, in each case of (A) and (B) as if such Underpayment Amount had
been payable at Closing (pursuant to  instructions from the Securityholders'
Representative, which instructions shall include an updated Pro Rata Share
definition (reflecting the cash amounts actually received by each Indemnifying
Person pursuant to this Agreement (including the  amount of any withholding
thereon, which will be deemed to have been received by such Indemnifying
Person)) for all purposes under Article XI or any other purpose under this
Agreement, other than in respect of distributions from the Escrow Fund  or
pursuant to Section 13.3(i)(A) to the Indemnifying Persons, for which the
original Pro Rata Share definition will continue to be used).

 

 

 

23  


 

 

(ii) If the Estimated Merger Consideration  exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration (an " _Overpayment Amount_ "), the Securityholders'
Representative and Parent will promptly issue a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent, from the Escrow Fund, the 
Overpayment Amount; provided, however, that if the Overpayment Amount exceeds
$1,000,000, then Parent may, in Parent's sole discretion, also elect to
recover any portion of the Overpayment Amount that exceeds $1,000,000 from the
Indemnifying  Persons, in each case, whether such recovery is from the Escrow
Fund or directly from the Indemnifying Persons, to be allocated among the
Indemnifying Persons as if such Overpayment Amount would have reduced the
Estimated Merger Consideration at  Closing (pursuant to instructions from the
Securityholders' Representative, which instructions shall include a schedule
to reflect that the former holders of Series C Preferred Stock would first
receive an amount with respect to distributions  from the Escrow Fund to the
Indemnifying Persons to make them whole for the Overpayment Amount that was
paid from the Escrow Fund and an updated Pro Rata Share definition that will
be used with respect to any remaining distributions from the  Escrow Fund or
pursuant to Section 13.3(i)(A) to the Indemnifying Persons, and a separate
updated Pro Rata Share definition (reflecting the cash amounts actually
received by each Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Agreement (including
the  amount of any withholding thereon, which will be deemed to have been
received by such Indemnifying Person, and taking into account any amounts paid
back to Parent under this Section 3.6(e)(ii))) that will be used for all
purposes under Article XI  or any other purpose under this Agreement).

 

 

(iii) Any amount payable pursuant to this  Section 3.6(e) will be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within three Business Days after
the determination of the amount of such payment, or such other date as is
specified in this Section 3.6(e). Any payments made pursuant  to this Section
3.6 shall constitute an adjustment of the Estimated Merger Consideration,
including for Tax purposes, and shall be treated as such by the Parties on
their Tax Returns, unless otherwise required by a change in Law occurring
after  the date of this Agreement or pursuant to a closing agreement with the
applicable Tax Authority or a non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

 

Section 3.7 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company,  the Company
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent and
their agents and Affiliates shall be entitled to withhold from amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as such parties are
required  to withhold under the Code or any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Tax Authority in accordance with applicable Tax Law,
such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

 

Section 3.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after  the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation  and Parent
shall take, and shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the
name of the Company and otherwise) to take, such action.

other business entity. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a

consummate, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby in accordance with the Charter and applicable Law. The execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the
performance of the  Company's obligations hereunder and thereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or
other action on the part of the Company.   This Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement to which the Company is a party has been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and (assuming due execution by the other parties hereto and
thereto) constitute the legal, valid and binding  obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except, as to

administrative  or regulatory authority, agency, bureau, commission,
department or other governmental or administrative instrumentality,

Authority_ "), in connection with the execution  and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except such filings or consents as may be

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain books,  records and
accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of their financial statements in conformity with GAAP in
all material respects and to  maintain accountability for their assets. There

employees who have a significant role in the Company's or the Company
Subsidiary's internal control over financial reporting.

Contract, breach of warranty, tort, infringement, or violation of a Law),
(iii) Liabilities  arising from performance obligations under Contracts (none
of which results from any breach of Contract, breach of warranty, tort,
infringement, or violation of a Law) or (iv) Company Transaction Expenses.

any Business Employee, any Company Stockholder or any Affiliate of a Company
Stockholder.

except  in each case for such inaccuracies in such representations and

(a) the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

 

(b) Parent or the Company, in the event that any condition set  forth in
Article VII, VIII or IX, as applicable, shall not be satisfied, or shall not
be reasonably capable of being satisfied, by 90 days following the date of
this Agreement (the " _Walk-Away Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that 
neither Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) if the
failure of the applicable condition in Article VII, VIII or IX (as the case
may be) to be satisfied or the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Walk-Away  Date referred to in the applicable paragraph results from (i)
the breach by such Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or (ii) such Party's failure to use its required
efforts to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby;

 

 

(c) Parent, if the Company breaches any representation, warranty,  covenant,
obligation or agreement hereunder, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become
inaccurate, and  such breach shall not have been cured, or by its nature
cannot be cured, within 30 days following receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach;

 

 

(d) the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches any  representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement hereunder, such that the

this Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to a Party if the issuance of such
final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

Agreement.

effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without 
further action by any Party, except that the provisions of Section 6.1(d),
Section 6.4 and this Section 10.2 and Article XIV shall survive the

termination shall in no way limit any claim by any Party for willful breach by
another Party of the terms of this Agreement prior to or in connection with
such termination.

representations or warranties for which claims for indemnification are timely
asserted shall continue to survive solely as to the specific claim,

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI, from  and after
the Effective Time, each Indemnifying Person, in accordance with such
Indemnifying Person's Pro Rata Share, shall severally indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation on and
following the  Closing) and each of their respective officers, directors,
Affiliates, agents and employees (hereinafter referred to individually as a "
_Parent Indemnified Person_ " and collectively as " _Parent Indemnified
Persons_ ") from and against  any and all losses, costs, damages,
Liabilities, Taxes, judgments, settlements and expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys and in respect of any investigation conducted
by the Parent Indemnified Person) (collectively, " _Damages_ ")    incurred

resulting from:

 

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of  the representations and warranties
made by the Company in Article IV of this Agreement;

by or to be performed at or prior to the Closing by the Company in this
Agreement;

Plan Participant (i) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person
(including aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty) relating to or
arising out of any action taken (or failed to be taken) in  connection with
this Agreement or the negotiation, approval or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) with respect to or otherwise relating
to the proceeds payable in connection herewith and (B) any amounts paid to
holders  of Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration otherwise
payable in respect of the relevant Company Capital Stock in accordance with
Section 3.4(a); and

 

 

(vi) the items set forth on Schedule  11.2(a)(vi).

 

 

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI,  Parent and
Merger Sub shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Indemnifying
Persons and their heirs, successors and assigns (the " _Securityholder
Indemnified Persons_ ") harmless from and against any and all Damages incurred
by the  Securityholder Indemnified Persons arising out of, in connection with
or resulting from:

 

 


 

 

 

60  


 

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of  the representations and warranties
made by Parent or Merger Sub in Article V of this Agreement; and

 

 

(ii) any breach of or failure to comply with  any covenant or agreement made
by or to be performed by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement.

 

 

(c) _Limitations on Liability_.

 

 

(i) After the Closing, no Indemnitor shall  have any liability under Sections
11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b)(i), as applicable, unless and until the aggregate amount
of Damages suffered by the Parent Indemnified Person(s) or Securityholder
Indemnified Person(s), as the case may be, exceeds  $1,650,000.00 (the "
_Threshold_ "), after which all Damages above the Threshold shall be
recoverable by the applicable Parent Indemnified Person(s) or Securityholder
Indemnified Person(s), as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that the
Threshold shall not apply to claims for indemnification with respect to any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.4(f).

 

 

(ii) The aggregate amount of all Damages for  which an Indemnifying Person
shall be liable under Section 11.2(a)(i) shall not exceed such Indemnifying
Person's Pro Rata Share of $12,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to claims for  indemnification with
respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations. The aggregate amount of all Damages for which Parent and
Merger Sub shall be liable under Section 11.2(b)(i) shall not exceed
$12,000,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall
not apply to claims for indemnification with respect to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the Fundamental Representations.

 

 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent  Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to recover for, and the Threshold and limitations set forth in
Section 11.2(c)(ii) shall not apply as limitations on, any and all claims or
payments made with respect to Damages resulting from (A) claims for 
indemnification with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations, (B) common law fraud in the making of a
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement ("
_Fraud_ ") or (C) any claim  pursuant to Sections 11.2(a)(ii) through
11.2(a)(vi) (subsections (A) through (C), collectively, " _Exempted Claims_
"). Each Indemnifying Person's maximum aggregate liability to the Parent
Indemnified Persons with respect to all  indemnification claims pursuant to
this Article XI shall not exceed such Indemnifying Person's Pro Rata Share of
the Damages or the aggregate proceeds received by such Indemnifying Person
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

(d) In determining under this Article XI whether there has been  any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty or the amount of any
Damage attributable to a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant,
any qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants contained
herein  with respect to a Material Adverse Effect, materiality, material or
similar terms shall be disregarded; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall (i) "Material Contract" be read to mean "Contract" or (ii) the term
"Material  Adverse Effect" be read out of Section 4.5.

 

 

(e) EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, NO PARTY WILL IN ANY  EVENT BE
LIABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE XI FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES THAT
ARE NOT PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OR ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES BY REASON
OF A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR INDEMNITY CONTAINED 
HEREIN.

 

 

(f) With the exception of Exempted Claims and claims for  indemnification
with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties listed in Section 11.1(b), the funds that comprise the Escrow Fund,
at any given time, shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery of  the
Parent Indemnified Persons for claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
11.2(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that if all or a portion of the Escrow Fund
has been used to satisfy Damages resulting from Exempted Claims and amounts 
remaining in the Escrow Fund are insufficient to satisfy additional claims for
Damages made by the Parent Indemnified Persons during the Escrow Period for
non-Exempted Claims (any such claims, " _Excess Ordinary Claims_ "), then the
Parties  agree to treat such Excess Ordinary Claims as Exempted Claims to the
extent of the amount of the Escrow Fund previously used to satisfy Damages
resulting from Exempted Claims.

 


 

 

 

61  


 

 

(g) Exempted Claims and claims for indemnification with respect  to any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties listed in
Section 11.1(b) made by a Parent Indemnified Person shall be satisfied: (i)
first, from the Escrow Fund, but, in respect of Exempted Claims only after
(A)  satisfying all other pending claims that are not Exempted Claims, and
(B) making appropriate reserve as provided herein for any then unresolved
claims that are not Exempted Claims, and (ii) second, if the Escrow Fund is
insufficient after such  satisfaction or reserve or if the Exempted Claim
becomes payable after the end of the Escrow Period, (A) in the case of Fraud,
at the election of the Parent Indemnified Person and in any combination the
Parent Indemnified Person elects, directly  from each Indemnifying Person,
severally in accordance with such Indemnifying Person's Pro Rata Share of the
Damages, up to the aggregate proceeds received by such Indemnifying Person
hereunder and/or directly and individually from such Person or  Persons
committing such Fraud, without limit (and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein), and (B) in the case of Exempted Claims not
involving Fraud, directly from each Indemnifying Person, severally in
accordance with such  Indemnifying Person's Pro Rata Share of the Damages, in
an amount not to exceed the aggregate proceeds received by such Indemnifying
Person hereunder, taking into account the aggregate of all indemnification
claims made pursuant to this Article  XI, or in the case of claims for
indemnification with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations and warranties listed in Section 11.1(b) not involving Fraud,
directly from each Indemnifying Person, severally in  accordance with such
Indemnifying Person's Pro Rata Share of the Damages, in an amount not to
exceed in the aggregate $12,000,000, taking into account the aggregate of all
indemnification claims, other than Exempted Claims, made pursuant to  Section
11.2(a)(i).

 

 

(h) Any indemnification payment to be made by Parent or Merger Sub  to one or
more Securityholder Indemnified Persons shall be made to the Paying Agent and
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for distribution to the applicable Securityholder Indemnified
Person(s)  in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share pursuant to
instructions received from the Securityholders' Representative.

 

 

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

 

(a) _Non-Third Party Claims_. The Person seeking  indemnification hereunder
(the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the Party providing indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnitor_ ") in writing (such notice, a " _Claim Notice_
") promptly of the Indemnitee's discovery of any matter for  which the
Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee under this Article XI, which Claim
Notice shall specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Damages and
the nature of the breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
or  other item of indemnification at issue to which each such item is
related. The failure of an Indemnitee to deliver a timely Claim Notice
hereunder shall not affect its rights to indemnification hereunder, except to
the extent that the Indemnitor  is actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure to provide timely notice.

 

 

(b) _Third Party Claims_. With respect to any Claim (other  than a Claim made
with respect to Taxes, which is governed by Section 12.4) made by a third
Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against an Indemnitee for which the
Indemnitee will seek indemnification from the Indemnitor hereunder, after 
delivery of the respective Claim Notice, the Indemnitor shall be entitled (if
it so elects), at its own cost, risk and expense, upon notifying the
Indemnitee that the Indemnitor accepts responsibility for indemnification of
the Indemnitee in  connection with such Third Party Claim, (i) to take
control of the defense and investigation of such Claim, (ii) to employ and
engage legal counsel of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee
to handle and defend the same (unless  the Indemnitee has been advised by
counsel that there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest between
the Indemnitee and counsel chosen by the Indemnitor (including one or more
legal defenses or counterclaims available to it or to  other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying parties) that makes it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment
of the indemnified party for the same counsel to represent both the
indemnified  party and the indemnifying parties, in which event the
Indemnitee shall be entitled, at the Indemnitor's cost, risk and expense, to
reasonable fees of not more than one separate counsel of the Indemnitee's own
choosing), and (iii) to compromise  or settle such Claim, which compromise or
settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the Indemnitee, such
consent not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld, unless (A) there is no
finding or admission against Indemnitee of any  violation of the rights of
any Person and it is not reasonably expected to have an effect on any other
claims that may be made against the Indemnitee, (B) the sole relief provided
is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnitor (or  other
routine injunctive relief such as confidentiality obligations) and (C) the
Indemnitee will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement
of such Claims effected without its consent. After notice from the Indemnitor
to the  Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Claim, the
Indemnitor will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable
to the Indemnitee for any fees of other counsel with respect to the defense of
such claim, except as  otherwise provided in this Section 11.3(b) with
respect to possible conflicts of interest between the Indemnitee and
Indemnitor's counsel. If the Indemnitor fails to notify the Indemnitee that
the Indemnitor will assume the defense of such Claim  within fifteen calendar
days after delivery by the Indemnitee of the Claim Notice (or such shorter
period as may be required in connection with the underlying Claim), the
Indemnitee will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnitor) 
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor; _provided_
, _however_ , that, in such event, the Indemnitee shall not settle or
compromise any  Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor, which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Person undertaking the defense, compromise or settlement of
the Third Party Claim will keep  the other Parties reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and the Indemnitor and
Indemnitee shall cooperate (at the Indemnitor's expense) in all reasonable
respects in the investigation, trial and  defense of such Third Party Claim
and any appeal arising therefrom, and the Indemnitee may, at its own cost,
monitor and further participate in the investigation, trial and defense of
such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom. To  the extent that
there is an inconsistency between this Section 11.3 and Article XII as to any
Tax matter, the provisions of Article XII shall control.

 


 

 

 

62  


 

 

(c) For purposes of Section 11.3, (i) if the Indemnifying  Persons comprise
the Indemnitor, any references to the Indemnitor (except provisions relating
to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) will be deemed to
refer to the Securityholders' Representative and (ii) if the Indemnifying 
Persons comprise the Indemnitee, any references to the Indemnitee (except
provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any
payments) will be deemed to refer to the Securityholders' Representative.

 

 

Section 11.4 _No Right of Contribution_. Neither the  Securityholders'
Representative nor any Indemnifying Person shall make any claim for
contribution from the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors or employees with
respect to any  indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this
Agreement to the extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such
claim, and the Securityholders'  Representative, on its own behalf and on
behalf of all Indemnifying Persons, hereby waives any such right of
contribution from the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Company
Subsidiary and any of their respective officers, directors or  employees it
has or may have in the future with respect to any such indemnification claim.

 

 

Section 11.5 _Release from Escrow_. If the Indemnitor  notifies the
Indemnitee that it does not dispute the claim described in a Claim Notice, the
Damages identified in such Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnitor, and, if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnified
Person,  Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall, in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent to release the amount of
such Damages to Parent. Upon the release of any portion of the Escrow Fund to
the Indemnifying  Persons as provided in the Escrow Agreement, such amount
shall be delivered to the Paying Agent or Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, for further payment to the Indemnifying Persons in accordance with
each such Indemnifying Person's Pro Rata  Share pursuant to the instructions
received from the Securityholders' Representative.

 

 

Section 11.6 _Exclusive Remedy._ Except in the case of a claim based on Fraud
against the Person who committed such Fraud, and except as provided in 
Section 3.6, the remedies contained in this _Article XI_ are intended to
provide the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees following the Closing
as to all money damages for any action arising out of a breach of any
provision of this  Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Article XI shall (a) limit or restrict the ability or right of any Party
hereto to relief in accordance with _Section 14.11_ of this Agreement or (b)
limit the remedies available to a  Party under an Ancillary Agreement.

ARTICLE XII 
  _Tax Matters_

 

 

Section 12.1 _Tax Returns Required to Be Filed on or Prior to  the Closing
Date_.

 

 

(a) The Company shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns  required to
be filed by it and any Company Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date and
shall pay any and all Taxes due with respect to such returns. All Tax Returns
described in this Section 12.1(a) shall be prepared in a manner consistent 
with prior practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law. During the
period between the date of this Agreement and Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with draft income and other material Tax Returns (other than
information Tax  Returns or ordinary course employment Tax Returns) for the
Company and any Company Subsidiary at least 20 days prior to the due date for
filing in the case of any such income Tax Returns (and 10 days prior to the
due date for filing with respect  to all such other material Tax Returns). At
least 10 days prior to the due date for the filing of such income Tax Returns
(and 5 days prior to the due date for the filing of such other material Tax
Returns), Parent shall notify the  Securityholders' Representative in writing
of any objection Parent may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax
Returns. The Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall attempt in good
faith mutually to resolve any disagreements  regarding such Tax Returns prior
to the due date for filing thereof. During the period between the date of this
Agreement and Closing, no income or other material Tax Return (including
amended Tax Returns and claims for Tax refunds) (other than  information Tax
Returns or ordinary course employment Tax Returns) shall be filed without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Solely for purposes of this Section
12.1(a),  the term "material" shall mean any amount in excess of $25,000 in
the aggregate.

 

 

(b) Following the Closing, notwithstanding Section 12.1(a),  Parent shall
timely file or cause to be timely filed (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
that are filed after the Closing Date and that relate in whole or in part to
a  Pre-Closing Period (each, a " _Parent Prepared Return_ "), and, subject to
the right to indemnification and payment pursuant to this Agreement, Parent
shall timely remit or cause to be timely remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Parent  Prepared Returns. To the extent any Parent Prepared Return
relates in whole or part to a Pre-Closing Period, each such Parent Prepared
Return shall (i) be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of
the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries (except as otherwise required by
applicable Law) and (ii) include all Transaction Deductions on the income Tax
Return of the Company (or the applicable Company Subsidiary) for the taxable
period that includes the Closing Date to the  extent permitted by applicable
Law. In addition, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted
with respect to any such Parent Prepared Return that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used by the Company  and the
Company Subsidiaries in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. In the event that any item reflected on
any Parent Prepared Return could form the basis for a claim of indemnification
against  any Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Agreement, Parent will
submit such Parent Prepared Return to the Securityholders' Representative for
review and comment at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such
Parent Prepared Return (or, if  such due date is within 60 days following the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), and
Parent shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments made by the
Securityholders' Representative in writing to Parent  at least five days
prior to filing.

 

 

Section 12.2 _Allocation of Overlap Period Taxes_. For all  purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of an Overlap Period, the amount of Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that are allocable to the portion of an
Overlap Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
by  assuming that the Overlap Period consisted of two taxable years or
periods, one of which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of
which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and (a)
Taxes based on, or  computed with respect to, net income or earnings, gross
income or earnings, payroll, capital or net worth, or any other Taxes
resulting from or imposed on, sales, receipts, uses, transfers or assignments
of property or other assets, payments or  accruals to other Persons
(including wages) or any other similar transaction or transactions of the
Company or such company Subsidiary for the Overlap Period shall be allocated
between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books  basis"
by assuming that the books of the Company or such Company Subsidiary were
closed at the close of the Closing Date and (b) in the case of all other
Taxes, such Taxes shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or
periods on a daily  basis. For purposes of allocating any amount required to
be included under Sections 951 and/or 951A of the Code with respect to any
Overlap Period of any Company Subsidiary, the Overlap Period of a Company
Subsidiary will be deemed to close in  the same manner as described above and
the amount of income required to be included under Section 951 or 951A of the
Code in the portion of the Overlap Period ending on and including the Closing
Date will made by assuming that the taxable year or  period of the Company
Subsidiary were closed at the close of the Closing Date.

Section 12.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes incurred  in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Indemnifying
Persons and the Indemnifying Persons' portion of such Transfer Taxes shall
be  deemed a Company Transaction Expense. Any Tax Returns that must be filed
in connection with any Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed by the party
that customarily has primary responsibility for filing such Tax Returns
pursuant to the  applicable Laws and such party shall provide the other party
with a complete and correct copy thereof. Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative shall cooperate with each other in the provision of any
information or preparation of any  documentation that may be necessary or
useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction or exemption from any
Transfer Taxes.

 

 

Section 12.4 _Tax Claims_.

 

 

(a) Parent will give reasonably prompt written notice to the 
Securityholders' Representative of the assertion of any claim, or the
commencement of any Claim, with respect to: (x) any Tax Return of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that relates solely to one or more taxable periods
ending on or prior to  the Closing Date; or (y) any Tax liability of any the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for which the Indemnifying Persons are
partially or wholly responsible under this Agreement (each, a " _Tax Claim_
"); provided, however, that failure to so notify will not reduce the
Indemnifying Persons' indemnity obligation hereunder except to the extent the
Securityholders' Representative's ability to defend against such matter is
actually  and materially prejudiced thereby. Parent will control any such Tax
Claim; provided that Parent: (A) will keep the Securityholders' Representative
reasonably informed concerning the progress of such Tax  Claim, including
providing copies of all correspondence and other documents relevant to such
Tax Claim; (B) will consult with the Securityholders' Representative upon the
Securityholders' Representative's reasonable request for such consultation
from time to time with respect to such Tax Claim; and (C) will not, without
the  Securityholders' Representative's prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree to any
settlement with respect to any Tax that could form the basis  of a claim for
indemnification against the Indemnifying Persons pursuant to this Agreement.
The Securityholders' Representative will have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the  defense of any such Tax Claim (which will include
participation in meetings with Tax Authorities and review and comment on
written submissions to Tax Authorities) and to employ counsel, at the
Indemnifying Persons' expense, separate from the  counsel employed by Parent.

 

 

Section 12.5 Without the prior written consent of the  Securityholders'
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Parent will not (except for actions contemplated by this Agreement
or except to the extent in Parent's reasonable judgment the action is 
required by applicable Law or the applicable Tax position is not supportable
by a more likely than not position under applicable Law; provided that, prior
to taking any such action, Parent shall consult in good faith with the
Securityholders'  Representative with respect to whether or not such action
is required by applicable Law or the applicable Tax position is not
supportable by a more likely than not position under applicable Law): (a) file
or amend or permit the Surviving  Corporation to file or amend any Tax Return
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (b) extend or waive,
or cause to be extended or waived, or permit the  Surviving Corporation or
any Company Subsidiary to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other
period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (c) make or change any  election or
change any method of accounting with respect to Taxes with retroactive effect
to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date for the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (d) initiate discussions or 
examinations with any Tax Authority (including any voluntary disclosures)
regarding Pre-Closing Taxes; or (e) engage in any transaction on the Closing
Date after the Closing outside the Company's (or any Company Subsidiary's)
ordinary course of  business consistent with the Company's (or such Company
Subsidiary's) past practice; provided that the restrictions in clauses (a)
through (e) of this sentence will apply only to the extent that such  action
would have the effect of increasing the amount by which the Indemnifying
Persons will be required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons under
_Section 11.2_.

 


 

 

 

65  


 

 

Section 12.6 For all applicable Tax purposes, to the extent  permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties agree to, and no party shall take any action or
filing position inconsistent with, the following Tax treatment of the items
specified below:

 

 

(a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to be included in  the
consolidated federal income Tax Return that includes Parent starting on the
day following the Closing Date. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and their
Affiliates will not take any action, or permit any action to be taken, that
may prevent  the Tax year of the Surviving Corporation from ending for
applicable income Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) The Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having  been received
and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Persons on the Closing Date, and
no Tax withholding or reporting shall be required in connection with the
distribution of any portion of the Representative Expense Fund to the
Company  Securityholders.

 

 

(c) (i) the rights of the Company Stockholders to the amounts  held in the
Escrow Fund shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible
for installment treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding
provision of foreign, state or local Laws, as appropriate, and (ii) if and
to  the extent any amount is released from the Escrow Account to the Company
Stockholders, interest may be imputed on such amount if required by Section
483 or 1274 of the Code. In no event shall the aggregate amount of Escrow Fund
proceeds payable  to Company Stockholders in respect of Company Capital Stock
exceed an amount equal to (A) the portion of the Escrow Amount to be deposited
with respect to such Company Stockholder's Company Capital Stock, multiplied
by (B) the greater of (1) 105%  or (2) 100% plus 5 times the "Federal mid-
term rate" as defined in Section 1274(d)(1) of the Code (expressed as a
percentage) in effect at the time the Escrow Amount is funded. The preceding
sentence is intended to ensure that the right of the  applicable Indemnifying
Person to such payments is not treated as a contingent payment without a
stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

 

Section 12.7 _Cooperation with Respect to Tax Returns_.   Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, and each at their own expense (provided that any expenses incurred by
the Securityholders' Representative shall be solely on behalf of the 
Indemnifying Persons), as promptly as practicable, such information (including
access to books and records) and assistance, including making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanations of  any material provided, relating to the Company as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for
any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any adjustment or  proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes.
Parent or the Company shall retain in its possession, and shall provide the
Securityholders' Representative reasonable access to (including the right to
make copies of), such supporting books and  records and any other materials
that the Securityholders' Representative may specify with respect to Tax
matters relating to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
until the relevant statute of limitations has expired. After  such time,
Parent may dispose of such material.

 


 

 

 

ARTICLE XIII 
  _Securityholders ' Representative_

 

 

Section 13.1 _Securityholders ' Representative_. By voting in favor of the 
adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Merger,
and the consummation of the Merger or participating in the Merger and
receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive the
consideration payable in  connection with the Merger, each Indemnifying
Person hereby appoints and constitutes Fortis Advisors LLC as the
Securityholders' Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Persons
and as his, her or its attorney-in-fact and exclusive  agent to execute and
deliver this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement
(collectively, the " _Representative Agreements_ ") and for all other purposes
hereunder and thereunder and to take any and all actions and make  any and
all decisions required or permitted to be taken or made by the
Securityholders' Representative under the Representative Agreements and the
Securityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement, including the exercise
of the right to: (i)  give and receive notices and communications under the
Representative Agreements; (ii) authorize delivery to Parent of cash from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 3.6, Article XI and the Escrow
Agreement; (iii) determine the amounts  payable (if any) to each Company
Stockholder, Company Warrantholder and Bonus Plan Participant pursuant to
Sections 3.6(e), 11.5 and 13.3, (iv) agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of and comply with court orders with  respect to
disputes under any Representative Agreement; (v) agree to, negotiate, enter
into and provide amendments and supplements to and waivers in respect of any
Representative Agreement; and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate
in  the good faith judgment of the Securityholders' Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Securityholders' Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of
the Indemnifying Persons,  except as expressly provided in the Representative
Agreements and in the Securityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement,
and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders'
Representative in any ancillary  agreement, schedule, exhibit or the
Disclosure Schedules. The Securityholders' Representative may resign at any
time and the identity of the Securityholders' Representative may be changed,
and a successor Securityholders' Representative may be  appointed, from time
to time (including in the event of the resignation or the death, disability or
other incapacity of the Securityholders' Representative) by the Advisory
Group, and any such successor shall succeed the Securityholders' 
Representative as Securityholders' Representative hereunder. The immunities
and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders' Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the
Closing  and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
No bond shall be required of the Securityholders' Representative. From and
after the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholders'  Representative shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each Indemnifying Person.

 

 


 

 

 

66  

 

Section 13.2 _No Liability_. Certain Indemnifying Persons  have entered into
an engagement agreement (the " _Securityholders ' Representative Engagement
Agreement_") with the Securityholders' Representative to provide direction to
the Securityholders' Representative in connection with its services  under
the Representative Agreements and the Securityholders' Representative
Engagement Agreement (such Indemnifying Persons, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory
Group_ ").   Neither the Securityholders' Representative nor its members,
managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any
member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Securityholders '
Representative Group_"), shall be liable  for any liability, loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred, without gross negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud by the Securityholders' Representative, while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of its good faith judgment and  arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties or the
exercise of its rights under the Representative Agreements or the
Securityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement. The Securityholders' 
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its functions hereunder and shall be
entitled to: (i)  conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons, (ii) rely upon the Disbursement Schedule, (iii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iv) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on  behalf of the applicable
Indemnifying Person or other party. The Indemnifying Persons will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Securityholders' Representative Group from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,  penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in settlement and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs, in connection with seeking recovery from insurers and all expense of 
document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative
Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the Securityholders'
Representative's execution and performance of the Representative Agreements
and the  Securityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement, in each case
as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the
event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by  the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the
Securityholders' Representative, the Securityholders' Representative will
reimburse the Indemnifying Persons the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to  such gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud. If not paid directly to the Securityholders'
Representative by the Indemnifying Persons, any such Representative Losses may
be recovered by the Securityholders' Representative from (i) the  funds in
the Representative Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at
such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Indemnifying Persons; _provided_ , that while this Section 13.2 allows the 
Securityholders' Representative to be paid from the Representative Expense
Fund and the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Indemnifying Persons from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred,  nor does it prevent the Securityholders'
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Securityholders' Representative be required to advance or
risk its own funds on behalf of the  Indemnifying Persons or otherwise incur
any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to the Representative Agreements, the
Securityholders' Representative Engagement  Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Securityholders'
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Securityholders' Representative has been provided with funds, security or 
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Securityholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in performing
such actions. The  Indemnifying Persons acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders' Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

67  

Section 13.3 _Representative Expense Fund_. All  Representative Losses
incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in performing its duties
hereunder shall be paid from the Representative Expense Fund. The
Representative Expense Fund will be used (a) for the purposes of paying
directly, or  reimbursing the Securityholders' Representative for, any
Representative Losses or third party expenses incurred pursuant to any
Representative Agreement or the Securityholders' Representative Engagement
Agreement, or (b) as otherwise determined  by the Advisory Group. The
Securityholders' Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and will not be liable for any loss or diminution of
the Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its  gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud. The Securityholders' Representative
will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will
not  voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Securityholders' Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Representative Expense
Fund, and has  no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Indemnifying Persons will not receive any interest on the Representative
Expense Fund and assign to the Securityholders' Representative any such
interest. Subject to Advisory Group  approval, the Securityholders'
Representative may contribute funds to the Representative Expense Fund from
any consideration otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Persons. As soon
as practicable following the completion of the  Securityholders'
Representative's responsibilities, the Securityholders' Representative will
(i) deposit with the Paying Agent (A) for distribution to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share the remaining
Representative  Expense Fund, and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute
to each Company Stockholder its portion thereof in accordance with
instructions received from the Securityholders' Representative and (B) deposit
with the Surviving Corporation for  distribution to each Bonus Plan
Participant, their respective Pro Rata Shares of the remaining Representative
Expense Fund in accordance with instructions received from the
Securityholders' Representative and Section 12.6(b).

 

 

Section 13.4 _Books and Records_. Unless otherwise  consented to in writing
by the Securityholders' Representative, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall, for a period of seven years after the date of this
Agreement, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and
records  of the Surviving Corporation relating in whole or in part to any
period prior to the date of this Agreement without first offering to surrender
to the Securityholders' Representative such books and records or any portion
thereof which Parent or  the Surviving Corporation may intend to destroy,
alter or otherwise dispose of.

 

 

Section 13.5 _Decisions Binding_. The powers, immunities  and rights to
indemnification granted to the Securityholders' Representative _Group_
hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any
Indemnifying  Person and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii)
shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Indemnifying Person of the
whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund. Any
decision, act, consent or  instruction of the Securityholders' Representative
under the Representative Agreements or the Securityholders' Representative
Engagement Agreement shall constitute a decision of all of the Indemnifying
Persons and shall be final, binding and  conclusive upon each and every
Indemnifying Person and such Indemnifying Person's successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by such Indemnifying Person, and all
defenses which may be available to any Indemnifying Person to  contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders' Representative taken in
good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders'
Representative Engagement Agreement are waived. The Escrow Agent, Paying
Agent,  Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation may
rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders'
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and
every Indemnifying  Person. The Escrow Agent, Paying Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with, or in
reliance upon, any such decision, act,  consent or instruction of the
Securityholders' Representative.

obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Parties shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available  to them,
whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to: (a) a decree or
order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation, and/or (b) an injunction restraining such breach
or  threatened breach. In circumstances where the Company is obligated to
consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated (other than as a
result of Parent's or Merger Sub's failure to consummate the Closing in
violation of this  Agreement), the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees
that Parent and Merger Sub shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary
damages will be inadequate to compensate Parent and Merger Sub, and that
Parent and Merger Sub shall be  entitled to enforce specifically the
Company's obligations to consummate the Merger. In circumstances where Parent
and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not
been consummated (other than as a result of the  Company's failure to
consummate the Closing in violation of this Agreement), Parent and Merger Sub
expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company shall have suffered
irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate the 
Company, and that the Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parent
and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger. Each Party further
agrees that no other Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar  instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this Section 14.11, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar  instrument.

Section 14.12 _Waiver of Conflicts;  Privileged Communications_.

 

 

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that Cooley LLP  (the " _Firm_ ") has
acted as counsel to the Company in various matters involving a range of issues
and as counsel to the Company in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(b) In connection with any matter or dispute under this  Agreement, Parent
hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the
Company following the Closing to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) the Firm's prior 
representation of the Company and (ii) the Firm's representation of the
Securityholders' Representative and/or any of the Indemnifying Persons
(collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") prior to and after the Closing.

 

 

(c) Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself and,  after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of the Firm, the Company, any of the Seller
Parties, or any of their respective Representatives that relate in any way
to  the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or, beginning on the date of this Agreement,
any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Deal
Communications_ ") shall be  deemed to be retained and owned collectively by
the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by the Securityholders' Representative
on behalf of the Indemnifying Persons and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent or, following the Closing, the  Company. All Deal Communications that
are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged Deal Communications_ ")
shall remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong  solely to the
Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnifying Persons, shall be
controlled by the Securityholders' Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Persons and shall not pass to or be claimed by any of the Parent
or, following  the Closing, the Company; provided, further, that nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Affiliates) of
any applicable privileges or  protections that can or may be asserted to
prevent disclosure of any such communications to any third party.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a  dispute arises
between Parent or, after the Closing, the Company, on the one hand, and a
third party other than a Seller Party, on the other hand, Parent or, following
the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent 
the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor, following the Closing, the Company
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Securityholders'  Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that Parent or, following the
Closing, the Company is legally required by governmental order or otherwise to
access or obtain a copy of all or a  portion of the Privileged Deal
Communications, Parent shall immediately (and, in any event, within five
Business Days) notify the Securityholders' Representative in writing
(including by making specific reference to this Section 14.12(d)) so that 
the Securityholders' Representative may seek a protective order and Parent
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

 

 

(e) To the extent that Privileged Deal Communications  maintained by the Firm
constitute property of its clients, only the Securityholders' Representative
and the Indemnifying Persons shall hold such property rights and the Firm
shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such Privileged Deal 
Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship between the Firm,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand so long as such Privileged
Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were
being  requested in a Claim by an unrelated third party.

(f) Parent agrees on behalf of itself and, following the  Closing, the
Company, (i) to the extent that Parent or, after the Closing, the Company
receives or takes physical possession of any Privileged Deal Communications,
(A) such physical possession or receipt shall not, in any way, be deemed a
waiver  by any of the Seller Parties or any other Person, of the privileges
or protections described in this section, and (B) neither Parent nor,
following the Closing, the Company shall assert any claim that any of the
Seller Parties or any other Person  waived the attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection or any other right or expectation of client
confidence applicable to any Privileged Deal Communications and (ii) not to
seek to obtain the Privileged Deal Communications from  the Firm so long as
such Privileged Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or
protection if they were being requested in a Claim by an unrelated third
party.
