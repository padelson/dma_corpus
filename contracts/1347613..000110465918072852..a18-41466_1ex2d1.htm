unliquidated, asserted or unasserted) of the Sellers (collectively, the "
_Assumed Liabilities_ "):

 



 

(a) except as expressly set forth herein, all liabilities and obligations
arising from the ownership, possession or use of the Acquired Assets and the
operation of the Business, in each case from and after the Closing, it being
understood that liabilities and obligations arising from the ownership,
possession or use of the Acquired Assets or the operation of the Business
prior to the Closing (including the sale of Products by the Sellers and their
Affiliates prior to the Closing) other than Cure Costs shall not constitute
Assumed Liabilities regardless of when the obligation to pay such liabilities
and obligations arises;

 



 

(b) all liabilities and obligations arising under the Assigned Contracts,
arising after the Closing (other than Cure Costs);

 



 

(c) all Cure Costs;

 



 

(d) (i) all current accounts payable (and excluding any noncurrent accounts

excluding any payables related to API (including related to any purchases of
API pursuant to _Section 5.23_) which shall be deemed to be a Cure Cost, or
(2) accrued liabilities as of the Closing Date for research and development
related to the Products up to $312,000 and (ii) all claims related to or
arising from rebates, coupon programs, chargebacks and credits;

to the extent arising after the Closing;

 



 

(g) all liabilities and obligations relating to the employment or termination
of the Transferred Employees, solely to the extent arising after the Closing.

 



 

The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall in no way expand the
rights or remedies of any third party against the Purchaser or Sellers as
compared to the rights and remedies that such third party would have had
against Sellers absent the Chapter 11 Case had the Purchaser not assumed such
Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

Section 1.4. _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, none of BH, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of
either of the foregoing shall assume, be obligated to assume, be deemed to
have assumed, or be obliged to pay, perform or otherwise discharge, and the
Sellers shall be solely and exclusively liable with respect to, any
liabilities or obligations (of any nature, and whether based in common law or
statute or arising under written Contract or otherwise, known or unknown,
fixed or contingent, accrued or

 



     

 

 



 

unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated, asserted or unasserted) of the Sellers
and any Affiliate thereof other than the Assumed Liabilities (such liabilities
and obligations other than Assumed Liabilities, the " _Excluded Liabilities_
"). Without limiting the foregoing, BH and the Purchaser do not (nor do any of
their Affiliates) assume or agree to pay, perform or otherwise discharge the

accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated, asserted or unasserted) of

to employment with the Sellers or termination thereof, whether arising prior
to, on or after the Closing Date;

Section 1.5. _Assignment of Assigned Contracts_.

 



 

(a) _Section 1.5(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth with
respect to each Contract of the Sellers, the SellersÂ’ good-faith estimate of
the amount required to be paid with respect to each Contract to cure all
monetary defaults under such Contract to the extent required by Section 365(b)
and otherwise satisfy all requirements imposed by Section 365(d) of the
Bankruptcy Code (the actual amount of such costs with respect to the Assigned
Contracts, the " _Cure Costs_ "). Prior to the Sale Hearing, the Sellers shall
commence appropriate proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court and otherwise
take all reasonably necessary actions in order to determine the Cure Costs
with respect to any Assigned Contract entered into prior to the Petition Date,
including, the right (subject to _Section 5.1_ hereof) to negotiate in good
faith and litigate, if necessary, with any Contract counterparty the Cure
Costs needed to cure all monetary defaults under such Assigned Contract.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Designation Deadline, the
Purchaser may identify any Assigned Contract that the Purchaser no longer
desires to have assigned to it in accordance with _Section 1.5(e)_.

 



 

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Code and subject to the
other provisions of this _Section 1.5_, on the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall assign the Assigned Contracts pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code and the Sale Order, subject to the provision of adequate assurance by the
Purchaser as may be required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and
payment by the Purchaser of the Cure Costs, in respect of the Assigned
Contracts.

 



 

(c) To the maximum extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Code and subject to the
other provisions of this _Section 1.5_, the Sellers shall assume and transfer
and assign all of the Acquired Assets to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall
assume all of the Acquired Assets from the Sellers, as of the Closing Date,
pursuant to Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document to the
contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any asset
or any right thereunder if an attempted assignment without the consent of a
third party, which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing (after
giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), would constitute a
breach or in any way adversely affect the rights of the Purchaser or the
Sellers thereunder.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery to the Purchaser of any asset
that would be an Acquired Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would
require any consent from any Governmental Entity or any other third party and
such consents shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving
effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), the Closing shall proceed
without any reduction in Purchase Price without the sale, transfer,
assignment, conveyance or delivery of such asset unless there is a failure of
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_; in which case, the
Closing shall proceed only if each failed condition is waived by the party
entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event that any failed condition is
waived and the Closing proceeds without the transfer or assignment of any such
asset, then following the Closing, each of the Purchaser and each of the
Sellers shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to any approval of

 



     

 

 



 

the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, and shall cooperate with the other
parties, to obtain such consent as promptly as practicable following the
Closing. Pending the receipt of such consent, the parties shall, subject to
any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably
cooperate with each other to provide the Purchaser with all of the benefits of
use of such asset. Once consent for the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance
or delivery of any such asset not sold, transferred, assigned, conveyed or
delivered at the Closing is obtained, the Sellers shall promptly transfer,
assign, convey and deliver such asset to the Purchaser. To the extent that any
such asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits or use of any such asset
cannot be provided to the Purchaser, then as promptly as practicable following
the Closing, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall enter into such arrangements
(including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting), and shall reasonably
cooperate with each other to provide the Purchaser with all of the benefits of
use of such asset. The Sellers shall hold in trust for, and pay to the
Purchaser, promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other
monies received by the Sellers derived from their use of any asset that would
be an Acquired Asset in connection with the arrangements under this _Section
1.5(d)_. The parties agree to treat any asset the benefits of which are
transferred pursuant to this _Section 1.5(d)_ as having been sold to
Purchaser for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law. Each of the Sellers
and Purchaser agrees to notify the other parties promptly in writing if it
determines that such treatment (to the extent consistent with the relevant
arrangement agreed to by such Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
1.5(d)_) is not permitted for Tax purposes under applicable Law. Where such
treatment is not so permitted, and subject to the terms of any relevant
arrangement agreed to by Sellers and Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
1.5(d)_ (and without duplication of any such Taxes economically borne by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant thereto), Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the applicable Seller for any Taxes imposed on
such Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any such Acquired Asset
for any Post-Closing Tax Period (determined on a "with and without" basis).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, amend or revise _Section 1.1(c)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule setting forth the Assigned Contracts, in order
to add any Contract to, or eliminate any Contract from, such schedule at any
time during the period commencing from the date hereof and ending at the end
of the Auction (or if no Auction occurs, the date that is two (2) Business
Days before the commencement of the Sale Hearing) (the " _Designation
Deadline_ "). Automatically upon the addition of any Contract to _Section
1.1(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, it shall be an Assigned Contract
for all purposes of this Agreement. Automatically upon the removal of any
Contract from _Section 1.1(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule it shall be
an Excluded Asset for all purposes of this Agreement, and no liabilities
arising thereunder shall be assumed or borne by the Purchaser.

 



 

Section 1.6. _Purchase Price; Deposit Funds_.

 



 

(a) In consideration for the Acquired Assets, the Purchaser shall, in addition
to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchaser, pay the
following amounts (the " _Purchase Price_ "):

 



 

(i) (x) one hundred eighty five million dollars ($185,000,000) in cash,
_minus_ (y) the Cure Costs Deduction, _minus_ (z) the GTN Adjustment Amount
(the " _Cash_

 



      

 

 



 

 _Consideration_ "), net of any Deposit Funds paid to the Parent at the
Closing pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(i)_, which Cash Consideration shall be
paid to the Parent on behalf of the Sellers at the Closing; and

 



 

(ii) an amount in cash (the " _Severance Consideration_ ") to the Parent on
behalf of the Sellers equal to the lesser of (x) fifteen million dollars
($15,000,000) and (y) the amount of severance obligations (inclusive, for the
avoidance of doubt, of any payments and benefits in respect of any notice
periods under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (and any
similar state or local Law) (all such laws collectively, the " _WARN Acts_ ")
and any other termination benefits), plus any employer portion of payroll
taxes due in respect of such obligations and benefits, that are both (A)
payable to any employee of the Sellers who either (1) is an "Eligible
Employee" under the severance pay plan of the Parent on the Closing Date and
has not received on or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the
Auction an offer from BH or its Affiliate for employment commencing on the
Closing Date that meets the requirements set forth in _Section 5.14_, (2) is
an "Eligible Employee" under the severance pay plan of the Parent on the
Closing Date, is a Relocation Employee and has received, prior to the Closing
Date, and rejected (including by not performing services for BH or its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date) an offer from BH or its Affiliate for
employment commencing on the Closing Date that meets the requirements set
forth in _Section 5.14_ or (3) is a WARN Relocation Employee and has
received, prior to the Closing Date, and rejected (including by not performing
services for BH or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date) an offer from BH or
its Affiliate for employment commencing on the Closing Date that meets the
requirements set forth in _Section 5.14_, and (B) administrative expenses in
the Chapter 11 Case pursuant to Sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Sellers
are not authorized to pay severance to employees at the Closing pursuant to
the Sale Order, the Purchaser shall instead deposit the Severance
Consideration into an escrow account for the benefit of the employees entitled
thereto, to be paid to such employees upon the earlier of (X) the SellersÂ’
emergence from bankruptcy or (Y) Bankruptcy Court approval, with any remaining
unused funds being remitted to the Purchaser following payment of all
severance obligations.

 



 

If the Closing shall occur, at the Closing, the Purchaser and the Parent shall
provide joint written instructions, executed by their respective authorized
representatives under the Escrow Agreement, to the Escrow Agent that instruct
the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit Funds to the Parent on the Closing
Date. The Deposit Funds received by the Parent shall be applied at the Closing
toward the payment of the Cash Consideration portion of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) Within three (3) Business Days of the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order, subject to the execution of an escrow agreement reasonably acceptable
to the Sellers and the Purchaser (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), with an escrow
agent reasonably acceptable to the Sellers and the Purchaser (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "), the Purchaser shall deposit into escrow with the Escrow Agent an
amount equal to eighteen million five hundred thousand dollars ($18,500,000)
(such amount, together with all interest and other earnings accrued thereon,
the " _Deposit Funds_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Deposit Funds shall be
released by the Escrow Agent and delivered to either (x) the Purchaser or (y)
the Parent on behalf of the Sellers, as follows:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) if the Closing shall occur, the Deposit Funds shall be applied towards the
portion of the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser to the Parent pursuant to
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ hereof;

 



 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Sellers (A) pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ or (B) pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ in any circumstance where
the Purchaser is not entitled to terminate pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_
because the failure of the Closing to occur results from the failure of the
Purchaser to materially perform its obligations under _Section 5.3_ required
to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing, in each case unless at the
time of such termination the Purchaser would have been entitled to terminate
this Agreement and has given prior written notice to the Sellers of such
claimed right, then the Deposit Funds shall be delivered to the Parent; or

 



 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated other than in a manner provided by
_Section 1.6(b)(ii)_, the Deposit Funds shall be delivered to the Purchaser.

 



 

Section 1.7. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, BH and the Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable hereunder such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect thereto under the Code or any other Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall consult with the Sellers in
good faith prior to withholding any amounts payable to the Sellers promptly,
and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, notify the Sellers in writing if the Purchaser determines that any
withholding or deduction is required under the Code or any applicable Law with
respect to any portion of payment to the Sellers, and provide the Sellers with
reasonable opportunity to provide such forms or other evidence that would
eliminate or reduce any such required deduction or withholding. The Purchaser
further acknowledges that no such deduction or withholding in respect of Taxes
is anticipated as of the date hereof.

 



 

Section 1.8. _Designation Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Purchaser reserves the right to designate any asset as an
Acquired Asset or Excluded Asset under this Agreement by the Designation
Deadline, and (x) automatically upon the addition of any asset to _Section
1.1(a)-(p)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule prior to the Designation
Deadline, such asset shall be an Acquired Asset for all purposes of this
Agreement, and (y) automatically upon the addition of any asset to _Section
1.2(a)-(o)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule prior to the Designation
Deadline, such asset shall be an Excluded Asset for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.9. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The parties agree to allocate for
Tax purposes (and, as applicable, to cause their respective Affiliates to
allocate for Tax purposes) the Purchase Price (as adjusted to take into
account any payments pursuant to _Section 1.10_ as applicable) and any other
amounts treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes among the
Acquired Assets in accordance with the following procedures and, to the extent
applicable, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. The parties agree that no more than
$45,000,000 will be allocated to those certain licensing, development,

 



     

 

 



 

and commercialization agreements with Cipher Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
Shandong Luoxin Pharmaceutical Group Stock Co., Ltd. and other Intellectual
Property located outside of the United States (the " _Non-US Asset Allocation_
"). Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, BH shall deliver to Parent
a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as adjusted to take into account
any payments pursuant to _Section 1.10_ as applicable) and any other amounts
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date
(the " _Purchaser Â’s Allocation_"). No later than thirty (30) days following
the delivery of the PurchaserÂ’s Allocation, Parent may deliver to BH a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail any objections thereto, the basis
for such objections, and ParentÂ’s proposed allocation (" _Sellers Â’ Allocation
Notice_"). If Parent timely delivers to BH a SellersÂ’ Allocation Notice,
Parent and BH shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts. The PurchaserÂ’s Allocation, if no SellersÂ’ Allocation Notice is
timely delivered, or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the Parent
and BH during the twenty (20)-day period following the timely delivery of
SellersÂ’ Allocation Notice (the " _Allocation_ ") shall be final and binding
on the parties; _provided_ , that if SellersÂ’ Allocation Notice is timely
delivered and Parent and BH are unable to reach agreement within such twenty
(20)-day period, they shall not be required to reach agreement, and each party
shall file its respective Tax Returns in accordance with such allocation as it
determines to be correct and consistent with applicable Law. If an Allocation
is determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.9_,
each of the parties (a) shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) prepare and
file all Tax Returns (and Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594) in a manner
consistent with the Allocation and (b) shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates not to) take any position on any Tax Return or in connection with
any Tax proceeding inconsistent with the Allocation, in each case, except to
the extent otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of applicable state,
local or non-U.S. Law).

 



 

Section 1.10. _GTN Receivables_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with
their good faith estimate of GTN Receivables as of the Closing. The parties
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding such estimate,
and shall work to update such estimate to arrive at a final and agreed
calculation of GTN Receivables as of the Closing Date. In the event that the
parties fail to reach agreement as to such final calculation as of the Closing
Date, the amount of Cash Consideration payable at Closing shall be calculated
using the PurchaserÂ’s good faith calculation of GTN Receivables and the
parties shall submit the dispute as expeditiously as practicable (and in any
event within thirty (30) days) to a mutually agreeable, nationally recognized
accounting firm for resolution, the costs and fees relating to which shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by the
Purchaser. In the event that such accounting firmÂ’s final calculation of GTN
Receivables differs from the amount used in calculation of Cash Consideration
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Sellers or the Purchaser, as
applicable, shall make prompt payment to the other in the amount of such
difference, which shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

Except as disclosed in (x) the Parent SEC Documents publicly available prior
to the date hereof (but excluding any predictive, cautionary or forward
looking disclosures contained under the captions "risk factors," "forward

understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the

such other section), the Sellers represent and warrant to BH and the

entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified or, where relevant, in good

this Agreement and such Ancillary Documents by each Seller and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been

such Seller, including with respect to the Parent, by the Parent Board of
Directors, and no other corporate proceedings (pursuant to any SellerÂ’s
organizational documents or otherwise) on the part of any Seller is necessary
to authorize the consummation of, and to consummate, the transactions

incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of any Seller, (b)
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or result in

their respective internal accounting controls.

 



 

(c) The Books and Records maintained with respect to the Business and used in
the preparation of the Financial Statements accurately and fairly reflect, in
all material respects, the transactions and the assets and liabilities of the
Sellers with respect to the Business.

Section 3.10. _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of each item of Seller Registered
Intellectual Property and any Product IP that is Registered Intellectual
Property, including the current owner, the jurisdiction in which each item has

number or similar identifier, the filing date, and the applicable issuance,
registration or grant date.

 



 

(b) The Sellers exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to all
Seller Intellectual Property, including all Seller Registered Intellectual
Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Pre-Closing
Encumbrances. Following the Closing, the Purchaser will exclusively own, all
right, title and interest in and to all Seller Intellectual Property,
including all Seller Registered Intellectual Property, free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except for Permitted Post-Closing Encumbrances. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, all Seller Intellectual Property is fully
transferable, alienable and licensable by the Sellers, and following the
Closing, will be fully transferable, alienable and licensable by the Purchaser
without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party. No
Seller Intellectual Property, or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, Product IP,
is or was subject to any Action or settlement agreement that restricts in any
material respect the use, provision, transfer, assignment or licensing
thereof, as the case may be, by any Seller or that may affect the validity,
ownership, use or enforceability of any material Seller Intellectual Property
or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, material Product IP. Each item of Seller
Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting, and to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, not unenforceable or invalid.

Action that challenges the legality, validity, enforceability, registration,
use or ownership of a third partyÂ’s Intellectual Property.

Intellectual Property.

 



 

(e) No Actions are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened
against any Seller alleging that any Seller is infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property of any Person.

misappropriates (or has in the past infringed or misappropriated to the extent
there is any current liability therefor or a liability is reasonably expected
to arise) any Intellectual Property of any Person and (ii) following the
Closing will (when conducted in substantially the same manner by the
Purchaser), infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any
Person, in each case except as would not result in any material liability to
any of the Sellers. Since January 1, 2016, no Seller has received any written
offer to license or notice from any Person that would reasonably be construed
to be claiming that the operation of the Business, or any Product, conflicts
with, infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property of any Person or
constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any
jurisdiction.

 



 

(f) Since January 1, 2016, no Seller has brought, or threatened in writing to
bring, any Action against a third party alleging infringement or
misappropriation of any material Seller Intellectual Property.

consultant or contractor (whether current or former) for the purpose of
developing or creating any material Intellectual Property, such Seller has
obtained an assignment or transfer of all such Intellectual Property to such
Seller or otherwise is the owner of such Intellectual Property by operation of
Law. Each Seller has taken commercially reasonable actions to maintain and
protect Trade Secrets in its possession that are material Intellectual
Property of the Sellers or any third party. To the Knowledge of the Sellers,
there has been no unauthorized disclosure of any Trade Secrets that are
material Seller Intellectual Property.

operation of the Business, other than Ordinary Course Licenses. _Section
3.10(h)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all material Contracts to which any Seller is a party under which such

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (the foregoing,
together with the Ordinary Course Licenses, the " _IP Contracts_ ").

 



 

(i) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result
in (i) a material breach, violation, modification, cancellation, termination,
or suspension of any rights under the IP Contracts set forth on _Section
6.3(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the

 



      

 

 



 

grant of (or requirement to grant) any material license, covenant not to
assert, release, agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or other immunity to
any Seller Intellectual Property (or any Intellectual Property of BH or the
Purchaser) to any Person, or (iii) BH or the Purchaser being obligated to pay
any material royalties, or other material amounts, to any third party in

after the Closing, the Purchaser will be entitled to exercise all of the
SellersÂ’ rights under all IP Contracts to the same extent as prior to the
Closing.

 



 

Section 3.11. _Privacy and Data Protection_.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2016, each SellerÂ’s receipt, collection, maintenance,

respects with (i) applicable Information Privacy and Security Laws and (ii)
all applicable policies and procedures (which meet or exceed applicable

use or disclosure of any Protected Information, owned, used, maintained or
controlled by a Seller, including any such unauthorized access, acquisition,
use or disclosure of Protected Information that would, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, constitute a breach for which notification to individuals and/or
Governmental Entities is required under any applicable Information Privacy and
Security Laws or Contracts to which any Seller is a party. To the Knowledge of

the Sellers, have (i) suffered any breach that has resulted in any

procedures in compliance with applicable Information Privacy and Security Laws
in the case of any applicable breach of security compromising data containing
Protected Information. The Sellers have made available to BH and the Purchaser
true and complete copies of all currently effective privacy policies under
which any Seller collects, uses or stores any Protected Information.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2016, no Person has (i) provided a written notice or

SellersÂ’ privacy or data security practices, including any loss, damage or
unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, modification or other
misuse of any Protected Information maintained by or on behalf of any of the
Sellers. No Person has provided a complaint (written or otherwise) to a
Seller, nor, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, to any third party, regarding
the improper disclosure of Protected Health Information (as defined in HIPAA)
by any of the Sellers. Except as has not been and would not reasonably be

course consistent with past practice and in consultation with

 



     

 

 



 

BH, reasonable sales targets that relate to the first calendar quarter of 2019
for purposes of the Benefit Plans that are sales incentive plans. At Closing,
the Sellers shall deliver to BH a schedule setting forth, for each Transferred
Employee who participates in a Benefit Plan that is a sales incentive plan,
each unpaid sales incentive bonus accrued for such Transferred Employee in
accordance with the applicable Benefit Plan in respect of the period from
January 1, 2019 through the Closing Date (each, a " _Q1 2019 Sales Bonus_ ").
BH shall cause each Q1 2019 Sales Bonus to be paid to the applicable
Transferred Employee no later than May 15, 2019, subject to the applicable
Transferred EmployeeÂ’s continued employment with BH and its Affiliates through
the applicable payment date.

 



 

(b) BH or one of its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
provide an offer of employment to such number of individuals employed by the
Sellers (" _Business Employees_ ") set forth on _Section 5.14(b)_ of the

Affiliates to receive such offers, the " _Offer Employees_ "), in the same
position the Business Employee held as of the date of such employment offer,
such offer to be made no more than three (3) Business Days following the
Auction (a " _BH Offer_ "). Each offer of employment shall provide that
employment with BH or one of its Affiliates shall commence effective as of the
Closing, subject to the Offer EmployeeÂ’s continued employment with Sellers

to the Closing, (ii) a target annual bonus opportunity that is no less
favorable than that provided to the Transferred Employee prior to the Closing,
and (iii) employee benefits (excluding equity incentive compensation and
severance) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those in effect
for similarly situated employees of BH and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) BH shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each
Transferred Employee full credit for such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s service with
the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing for all
purposes, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals and
determination of the level of benefits (including vacation, severance and
retirement benefits, but excluding equity incentives), under any benefit plan
of BH or its Subsidiaries in which such Transferred Employee participates on
or following the Closing (the " _New Plans_ ") to the same extent recognized
by the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized (i) to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or
coverage, (ii) with respect to any New Plan that provides defined benefit
pension or post-retirement welfare benefits, or (iii) with respect to any New
Plan that is grandfathered or frozen or under which similarly situated
employees of BH and its Subsidiaries do not receive service credit. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any Transferred Employee, BH or its applicable Subsidiary shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be

 



     

 

 



 

waived for such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the equivalent Benefit Plan
in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing (such Benefit Plans collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) BH or
its applicable Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Transferred Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Sellers
will, or will cause the applicable Benefit Plan provider to, provide to BH or
its applicable Subsidiary or its group health plan provider on, or as promptly
as practicable following, the Closing Date, all information required by BH and
its group health plan provider to (1) ensure health, dental and vision plan
administration in compliance with this _Section 5.14(d)_, and (2) comply with
the obligations of BH and its Subsidiaries under Section 4980B of the Code,
Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA, and any similar applicable state Law
(collectively, " _COBRA_ ") to provide group health plan coverage to current
and former employees of Sellers (and their beneficiaries) who constitute "MandA
qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of the COBRA regulations.

 



 

(e) At least ten (10) days prior to the Auction, BH or its Affiliate shall
provide a list to Seller setting forth (i) the name of each Offer Employee and
(ii) for any Offer Employee whose offer of employment from BH or its Affiliate
is not expected to provide for employment in the same facility or location in
which such employee worked prior to the applicable offer of employment (or for
a sales employee, is not expected to cover the same sales territory that the
sales employee covered immediately prior to the applicable offer of
employment), the new facility, location or sales territory being offered by BH
or its Affiliate to such Offer Employee. With respect to any Business Employee
who is not identified by BH and its Affiliates as an Offer Employee or who is
identified as a WARN Relocation Employee, the Sellers shall, in each case to
the extent required by the WARN Acts, provide written notice of termination of
employment (in a form and manner compliant with the WARN Acts to the extent
possible), within three (3) Business Days following the conclusion of the
Auction (or if no Auction occurs, within three (3) Business Days following the
bid deadline established by the Bidding Procedures).

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall constitute or be construed (i) as an
amendment, termination or other modification of any employee benefit or
compensation plan or arrangement, or a restriction or other limitation on the
right of any party hereto to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such
plans or arrangements, (ii) as a guarantee of employment for any period, or a
restriction or other limitation on the right of any party hereto to terminate
the employment of any individual at any time, or (iii) to create any third
party rights in any Person other than the direct parties to this Agreement,
including any current or former service provider of the Sellers (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

(c) For a period of ten (10) years following the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates and their respective directors and
officers not to, disclose to any Person other than the directors, officers,

or use or otherwise exploit for their benefit, any Confidential Information,
except (i) pursuant to any Order, as required in any Action or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, (ii) to enforce its rights and remedies under this
Agreement or (iii) disclosure of Confidential Information in connection with
the Chapter 11 Case shall not constitute a breach of this _Section 5.15(c)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is required by
applicable Law or in connection with the Chapter 11 Case, the Sellers shall,
to the extent reasonably possible, provide the Purchaser with prompt notice of
such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the Purchaser may seek
at its own cost and expense an appropriate protective order. " _Confidential
Information_ " shall mean any proprietary or confidential information to the
extent related to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, excluding any information that (x) is (as of the Closing Date) or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach
of this _Section 5.15(c)_ or (y) becomes available to the Sellers, their
Affiliates or their respective directors and officers after the Closing Date
on a non-confidential basis from a source other than BH, the Purchaser or

agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to BH, the Purchaser or their Affiliates or any other person
with respect to such information.

 



 

Section 5.16. _Payments Received_. The Sellers and the Purchaser each agree

respective Affiliates, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using

other party hereto or its Affiliates and will account to the other for all
such receipts.

 



 

Section 5.17. _Use of Names and Marks_. The Purchaser and its Affiliates
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the transfer of Intellectual
Property included in the Acquired Assets, (a) the Sellers will continue using
their current corporate names during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case and
any additional time during which the Sellers wind down their affairs, and (b)
the Sellers shall be entitled to refer to names and marks included in the
Acquired Assets in filings with Governmental Entities, for factual or

(25) days after the end of each calendar month, the "average manufacturer
price" (as defined under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections
1396r-8(k)(l)) and units for each Product identified by NDC and (iii) any
other information reasonably requested by the Sellers to allow the Sellers to
comply with such requirements, and, in each case, a certification to the best
of the PurchaserÂ’s knowledge of the accuracy and completeness thereof (subject
to any updates of the information included in such certification) in all
material respects, within ten (10) days after BH publicly announces its
quarterly financial results; _provided_ , that the PurchaserÂ’s obligations

Purchaser.

 



 

Section 5.20. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to the Acquisition, and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is

this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Acquisition.

 



 

Section 5.21. _Reporting_. The Sellers shall (x) deliver to the Purchaser

to deliver to Purchaser such additional financial information with respect to
the Business and the Sellers, and on such periodic basis, as may reasonably be
requested by the Purchaser.

 



 

Section 5.22. _Additional_ _Actions_. None of the Sellers, BH or the Purchaser
will file any pleading or take any other action in the Bankruptcy Court with
respect to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby that is inconsistent with performing and carrying out the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in the foregoing will
be construed to limit in any way BH or the PurchaserÂ’s rights under this
Agreement, or to limit BH, the PurchaserÂ’s or the SellersÂ’ rights to advocate
for the approval of this Agreement and against any Alternative Transaction.

 



 

Section 5.23. _Minimum Inventory Purchases_. If, at any time during the thirty
(30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, either Sellers, on the one
hand, or BH or the Purchaser (as communicated in writing by BH or the
Purchaser to the Sellers), on the other hand, reasonably believes that the
amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient for the Trulance Product (" _API_
") that will be in Inventory as of the Closing Date is less than 30.0
kilograms (the " _Minimum API Quantity_ "), then the Sellers shall, prior to
the Closing Date, purchase API up to the lesser of (x) the total amount of API
held by third-party logistics warehouses and (y) the amount of API required to
hold the Minimum API Quantity as of the Closing Date. If requested by BH or
the Purchaser, the Sellers shall, prior to the Closing, deliver to BH and the
Purchaser evidence reasonably satisfactory to BH and the Purchaser that such
purchase has been made. If, at any time prior to the Closing Date, BH or the
Purchaser requests in writing that the Sellers order API (including requesting
delivery of existing API or placing orders for new API with the SellersÂ’ API
supplier), then (x) the Sellers will promptly make such order in the quantity
requested by BH or the Purchaser (consistent with the rights of the Sellers to
place such order with the SellersÂ’ API supplier) and (y) the Cash
Consideration will, at the time the Sellers make any cash payment to the
SellersÂ’ API supplier pursuant to this sentence (which will not exceed, in the
case of existing API requested for delivery up to 70% of the original price
therefor (not including any prepayments), and in the case of newly ordered API
up to 30% of the price therefor) be automatically increased by the amount of
such cash payment.

 



 

Section 5.24. _DIP Facility_.

ability of the parties to consummate the Acquisition promptly at the Closing
all conditions to the funding of the DIP Facility set forth in the DIP
Facility Term Sheet (it being understood that all conditions to funding the
DIP Facility are set forth therein). The Sellers shall give BH and the

 



     

 

 



 

Purchaser prompt notice upon obtaining knowledge of any fact, change, event or
circumstance with respect to the DIP Facility that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably lead to an event of default under, or failure to
fund all or any portion of, the DIP Facility, or materially impair or
materially delay the Closing.

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall neither agree to nor permit any termination, amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any of its
rights under, the DIP Facility Term Sheet or the DIP Loan Documents, without
the prior written consent of BH and the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) If all or any portion of the DIP Facility becomes unavailable, or any of
the DIP Facility Term Sheet or the DIP Loan Documents shall be withdrawn,
repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, then the Sellers shall use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as
practicable, from the same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative
financing and on terms, taken as a whole, not less favorable to BH and the
Purchaser than the terms, taken as a whole, of the DIP Facility.

(f) _Officer Â’s Certificates_. Each of the Sellers shall have delivered to BH
and the Purchaser a certificate duly executed by an executive officer of each
Seller certifying to the effect that the conditions set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_, _Section 6.3(b)_, and _Section 6.3(e)_ have been satisfied.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of BH and the Purchaser only and
accordingly BH and the Purchaser will be entitled to waive compliance with any
such conditions if they see fit to do so, without prejudice to any rights and
remedies at Law and in equity and also without prejudice to any of rights of
termination or otherwise in the event of the failure to fulfill any other
conditions in whole or in part.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Concurrent Delivery_. It shall be a condition of the Closing
that all matters of payment and the execution and delivery of documents, in
each case, at Closing by any party to the other pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement shall be concurrent requirements and that nothing will be complete
at the Closing until everything required as a condition precedent to the
Closing has been paid, executed and delivered, as the case may be.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 

**

 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 7.1. _Termination_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated by either the Purchaser or the Sellers in
the event that the Closing has not occurred on or before the date that is
ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement, or such later date as may
be mutually agreed in writing by the parties

 



     

 

 



 

(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if as of such date all
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ shall have been satisfied
or waived or shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing (but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the Closing of all such
conditions), except for _Section 6.1(a)_ or, solely in respect of the HSR
Act, _Section 6.1(b)_, then, the Purchaser or the Parent (on behalf of the
Sellers) may, by written notice to the other party, extend such date to the
date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of this Agreement;
_provided, further,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(a)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
materially perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed by it at or prior to the Closing results in the failure of the
Closing to occur prior to such date.

 



 

(b) This Agreement may also be terminated prior to the Closing:

 



 

(i) at any time by the mutual written agreement of the Purchaser and the
Sellers;

 



 

(ii) by the Purchaser, if (x) there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of the Sellers which breach, either individually
or in the aggregate with other breaches by the Sellers, would result in, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_, as the case may be, or (y)
there has been any material breach by the Sellers of the Bidding Procedures
Order or the Sale Order, in each case which is not cured within ten (10)
Business Days following written notice to the Sellers thereof (and in any
event prior to the Outside Date) or which by its nature or timing cannot be
cured within such time period ( _provided_ , that neither BH nor the Purchaser
is then in material breach of any of the covenants, agreements,
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of BH or
the Purchaser);

 



 

(iii) by the Sellers, if (x) there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of BH or the Purchaser which breach, either
individually or in the aggregate with other breaches by BH and the Purchaser,
would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_, as the
case may be, or (y) there has been any material breach by BH or the Purchaser
of the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, in each case which is not
cured within ten (10) Business Days following written notice to BH and the
Purchaser thereof (and in any event prior to the Outside Date) or which by its
nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period ( _provided_ , that
the Sellers are not then in material breach of any of the covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the
part of the Sellers);

 



 

(iv) by the Purchaser, if the Sellers shall fail to file any of the DIP
Motion, the Sale Motion or the Bidding Procedures Motion with the Bankruptcy
Court on or prior to December 12, 2018;

 



 

(v) by the Purchaser, if the Sellers shall fail to file the Chapter 11 Case on
or prior to December 12, 2018;

 



     

 

 



 

(vi) by the Purchaser, if the Chapter 11 Case is dismissed or converted to a
liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code;

 



 

(vii) by the Purchaser, if the Bankruptcy Court enters any Order materially
inconsistent with the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order or the
Acquisition;

 



 

(viii) by either the Sellers or the Purchaser, if a Governmental Entity issues
a final, non-appealable ruling or Order permanently prohibiting the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(viii)_ shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein results in such ruling or Order;

 



 

(ix) by the Purchaser, if any creditor of any Seller obtains a final and
unstayed Order of the Bankruptcy Court granting relief from the stay to
foreclose on any portion of the Acquired Assets;

 



 

(x) by either the Sellers or the Purchaser, if the Auction has occurred and
the Purchaser is not the Successful Bidder;

 



 

(xi) by the Purchaser, if the Purchaser is the Successful Bidder and the Sale
Hearing has not been commenced on or prior to February 15, 2019; _provided_
that the failure of the Sale Hearing to commence on or prior to such time is
not caused by the PurchaserÂ’s material breach of this Agreement or the CourtÂ’s
calendar;

 



 

(xii) by the Purchaser, if the Bankruptcy Court has not entered the Bidding
Procedures Order, including approval of the Break-Up Fee and Expense
Reimbursement Amount, by January 4, 2019, or if the Bidding Procedures Order
has been entered by such date but is stayed, stayed pending appeal, reversed
or vacated, or if such Bidding Procedures Order has been entered by such date
but has been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in any manner
materially adverse to BH or the Purchaser;

 



 

(xiii) by the Purchaser, if the bid deadline has not occurred by February 9,
2019, or if the Auction is not held by February 12, 2019;

 



 

(xiv) by the Purchaser, if the Bankruptcy Court has not entered the Sale Order
approving the Acquisition by Purchaser by February 15, 2019, or if such Sale
Order has been entered by such date but is stayed or stayed pending appeal or
has been reversed or vacated, or if such Sale Order has been entered by such
date but has been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in a manner
materially adverse to BH and the Purchaser and without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser;

 



 

(xv) by the Purchaser, if (A) the Bankruptcy Court fails to enter the Final
DIP Order on or before January 15, 2019 and such failure results in an
unwaived and uncured event of default under the DIP Facility or (B) the DIP
Facility Term Sheet or the DIP Facility shall have been terminated, the DIP
Lenders shall have refused to advance funds on account of the failure of any
condition precedent thereto or the principal amount of the loans

 



     

 

 



 

thereunder shall be (or shall be asserted by the lenders thereunder to be) due
and payable at any time on or prior to the Closing; or

 



 

(xvi) by the Purchaser, at any time prior to the end of the Auction (or if no
Auction occurs, the Closing Date), if BH or the Purchaser determines in its
good faith judgment that there is a reasonable possibility of losing
continuous access to supply under, and delivery to the Sellers (prior to the
Closing) or to BH and the Purchaser (after the Closing) of the goods and
services purchased under, the Contracts set forth on _Section 7.1(b)(xvi)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree, that in the
event that the Sellers determine, in their reasonable discretion, that the
last Overbid (as defined in the Bidding Procedures) submitted by the Purchaser
is better than all other Qualified Bids (as defined in the Bidding Procedures)
as such Qualified Bids may be amended by an Overbid submitted at the Auction,
then within two (2) Business Days following the conclusion of the Auction, the
Sellers, BH and the Purchaser shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement
to reflect the PurchaserÂ’s last Overbid; it being acknowledged and agreed that
this Agreement shall not be deemed to have been terminated by virtue of the
PurchaserÂ’s not having submitted the winning bid at the Auction.

 



 

Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.2_, in the event of
termination of this Agreement by either party hereto in accordance with
_Section 7.1_, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate without any liability of any party to any other parties
hereto, except for liability for fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination. The provisions of _Section 1.6(b)(ii)_, _Section
1.6(b)(iii)_, _Section 5.12_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_ (other
than _Section 8.1_, _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_) shall expressly
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In consideration of the Purchaser and its Affiliates having expended
considerable time and expense in connection with this Agreement and the
negotiation thereof, and the identification and quantification of assets to be
included in the Acquired Assets, and to compensate the Purchaser as a
stalking-horse bidder, and regardless of whether or not the Purchaser makes
any matching or competing bids at the Auction, the Sellers shall pay to the
Purchaser a break-up fee in an amount equal to seven million dollars
($7,000,000) (the " _Break-Up Fee_ "), (x) in the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(x)_ and (y)
in the event that this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_, _Section 7.1(b)(v)_, _Section 7.1(b)(vi)_,
_Section 7.1(b)(vii)_, _Section 7.1(b)(ix)_, _Section 7.1(b)(xi)_, _Section
7.1(b)(xii)_, _Section 7.1(b)(xiii)_, _Section 7.1(b)(xiv)_, or _Section
7.1(b)(xv)_, and within nine (9) months following the termination of this
Agreement (1) any Seller enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Alternative Transaction or (2) an Alternative Transaction shall have been
consummated (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), an " _Alternative
Transaction Trigger_ "); such Break-Up Fee shall be due and payable (A) (i)
simultaneously with any termination of this Agreement by the Sellers, or (ii)
within three (3) Business Days after the termination of this Agreement by BH
or the Purchaser, in the case of the foregoing clause (x), and (B)
simultaneously with the earliest to

 



     

 

 



 

occur of any Alternative Transaction Trigger in the case of the foregoing
clause (y). The Break-Up Fee shall, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, be
treated as an administrative expense in the Chapter 11 Case under Section
503(b)(1)(A) and Section 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Sellers
acknowledge and agree that: (i) the approval of the Break-Up Fee is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in the
absence of the SellersÂ’ obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee, BH and the
Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement; (iii) the entry of BH
and the Purchaser into this Agreement is necessary for preservation of the
estate of the Sellers and is beneficial to the Sellers because, in the
SellersÂ’ business judgment, it will enhance the SellersÂ’ ability to maximize
the value of their assets for the benefit of their creditors and other
stakeholders; (iv) the Break-Up Fee is reasonable in relation to the
PurchaserÂ’s costs and efforts and to the magnitude of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the PurchaserÂ’s lost opportunities resulting from the
time spent pursuing the transactions contemplated hereby; and (v) time is of
the essence with respect to the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order by the
Bankruptcy Court, approving, among other things, the process by which bids may
be solicited, including the Bidding Procedures. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Break-Up Fee, if payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_, shall be in
addition to the return of the Deposit Funds and payment of the Expense
Reimbursement Amount, in each case, to the extent payable to the Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(iii)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_, respectively.

 



 

(c) In consideration of the Purchaser and its Affiliates having expended
considerable time and expense in connection with this Agreement and the
negotiation thereof, and the identification and quantification of assets to be
included in the Acquired Assets, upon any termination of this Agreement, other
than any termination by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ (unless at the time of any such termination the
Purchaser would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_) the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser
the Expense Reimbursement Amount within five (5) Business Day after the
termination of this Agreement. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that (A) the
payment of the Expense Reimbursement Amount is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) in the absence of the
SellersÂ’ obligation to make this payment, the Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement, (C) the damages resulting from termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Purchaser is entitled to the Expense
Reimbursement Amount are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and
that the delivery of the Expense Reimbursement Amount to the Purchaser is not
a penalty, but rather shall constitute a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Purchaser in the circumstances where the Purchaser is entitled
to the reimbursable expenses for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummating of the transactions
contemplated thereby, and that, without these agreements, the Purchaser would
not enter into this Agreement; (D) time is of the essence with respect to the
payment of the Expense Reimbursement Amount and (E) the Expense Reimbursement
Amount shall, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, constitute an
administrative expense of the SellersÂ’ estates under Sections 503(b)(1)(A) and
507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the Expense
Reimbursement Amount, if payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_, shall be
in addition to the Deposit Funds and the Break-Up Fee, in each case, to the
extent payable to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(iii)_ and
_Section 7.2(b)_, respectively.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 7.2(a)_, the PurchaserÂ’s right to receive the
one-time payment of the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement Amount
(as the case may be) from the Sellers as provided in _Section 7.2(b)_ and
_Section 7.2(c)_, shall, other than in connection with fraud on the part of,
or an intentional breach of this Agreement by, any Seller, (x) be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to BH and the Purchaser against the Sellers or any
of their respective former, current or future equityholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates, agents or Representatives with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated under circumstances in which the Break-Up Fee and/or the
Expenses Reimbursement Amount (as the case may be) is due and payable, and (y)
upon receipt by Purchaser of the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement
Amount (as the case may be), none of the Sellers or any of their respective
former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, Affiliates,
agents or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Sellers
be required to pay the Break-Up Fee on more than one occasion and the parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Sellers be required to pay
the or the Expense Reimbursement Amount on more than one occasion. If the
Agreement is terminated by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_
(unless at the time of any such termination the Purchaser would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section
7.1(b)_ and has given prior written notice to the Sellers of such claimed
right), the Purchaser shall forfeit the Deposit Funds and any interest thereon
and such amounts shall be delivered to the Sellers pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)_. If this Agreement is terminated by the Sellers as contemplated by
_Section 1.6(b)(ii)_, other than in connection with fraud on the part of, or
an intentional breach of this Agreement by, BH or the Purchaser, the receipt
of the Deposit Funds shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the
Sellers against BH or the Purchaser or any of their respective former, current
or future equityholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or
Representatives with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and upon receipt by the Sellers of the Deposit Funds,
none of BH or the Purchaser, or any of their respective former, current or
future equityholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) If the Sellers fail to take any action necessary to cause the delivery of
the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement Amount under circumstances
where the Purchaser is entitled to the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense
Reimbursement Amount and, in order to obtain such Break-Up Fee and/or Expense
Reimbursement Amount the Purchaser commences a suit which results in a
judgment in favor of the Purchaser, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, in
addition to the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement Amount, an
amount in cash equal to the costs and expenses (including attorneyÂ’s fees)
incurred by the Purchaser in connection with such suit.

 



 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Sellers are entitled to the Deposit Funds are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the delivery of the
Deposit Funds is not a penalty but rather shall constitute liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Sellers in the circumstances
where the Sellers are entitled to the

 



     

 

 



 

Deposit Funds for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities forgone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, without these agreements, the Sellers would not enter into this
Agreement. If the Purchaser fails to take any action necessary to cause the
delivery of the Deposit Funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement under
circumstances where the Sellers are entitled to the Deposit Funds and, in
order to obtain such Deposit Funds the Sellers commence a suit which results
in a judgment in favor of the Sellers, the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers
an amount in cash equal to the costs and expenses (including attorneyÂ’s fees)
incurred by the Sellers in connection with such suit.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 

**

 

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

Section 8.1. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) All sales, use, excise, transfer, documentary, stamp, value added,
recordation, license, conveyance and other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_
"), if any, imposed on or with respect to the Acquisition shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and
shall be paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority promptly when due by the
Person having the obligation to pay such Transfer Tax under applicable Law.
The party hereto responsible under applicable Law for filing a Tax Return with
respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax
Return and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other parties. BH
and Parent shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to reduce
or eliminate any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, with respect to any Acquired Asset, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall apportion the liability for real and personal
property Taxes, ad valorem Taxes, and similar Taxes (" _Periodic Taxes_ ") for
Straddle Periods applicable to such Acquired Asset in accordance with this
_Section 8.1(b)_. The Periodic Taxes described in this _Section 8.1(b)_
shall be apportioned between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing
Date, with the Purchaser liable for that portion of the Periodic Taxes for a
Straddle Period (which portion of such Taxes shall for purposes of this
Agreement be deemed attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period) equal to the
Periodic Taxes for such Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days remaining in such Straddle Period
after the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in such entire Straddle Period. The Sellers shall be liable for that
portion of the Periodic Taxes for a Straddle Period for which the Purchaser is
not liable under the preceding sentence (which portion of such Taxes shall for
purposes of this Agreement be deemed attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period). The party hereto responsible under applicable Law for paying a Tax
described in this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall be responsible for administering the
payment of such Tax. All apportionments hereunder shall be final as of the
Closing Date and there will be no re-apportionments of any Periodic Taxes
regardless of whether information becomes available after the Closing Date
that alters the amount of Taxes that would have been due with respect to the
Straddle Period. To the extent the liability for Periodic Taxes for a certain
Straddle Period is not determinable at the time of Closing or such Periodic
Taxes are charged in arrears, such Periodic Taxes shall be prorated for

 



      

 

 



 

such Straddle Period, based on the most recent ascertainable full tax year
without adjustment. For purposes of this _Section 8.1(b)_, the Straddle
Period for ad valorem Taxes and real and personal property Taxes shall be the
fiscal period for which such Taxes were assessed by the applicable Tax
jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) The Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, as the
case may be (the " _Reimbursing Party_ "), shall provide reimbursement for any
Tax paid by the other (the " _Paying Party_ "), all or a portion of which is
the responsibility of the Reimbursing Party in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (including this _Section 8.1_). Within a reasonable time prior
to the payment of any such Tax, the Paying Party shall give notice to the
Reimbursing Party of the Tax payable and the Paying PartyÂ’s and Reimbursing
PartyÂ’s respective liability therefor, although failure to do so shall not
relieve the Reimbursing Party from its liability hereunder except to the
extent the Reimbursing Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(d) The parties shall provide each other with such assistance as reasonably
may be requested by any of them in connection with (i) the preparation of any
Tax Return, (ii) the determination of any liability in respect of Taxes or the
right to any refund, credit or prepayment in respect of Taxes (including
pursuant to this Agreement) or (iii) any audit or other examination by any
Taxing Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceeding with respect to
any Taxes.

 



 

Section 8.2. _Bulk Sales_. The Purchaser and the Sellers hereby waive
compliance with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer" or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect
to the sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer of any or all of the Acquired
Assets to the Purchaser.

 



 

Section 8.3. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. No
representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document
shall survive the Closing. No covenants in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Document shall survive the Closing except (1) to the extent the terms thereof
expressly contemplate performance following the Closing and (2) any covenants
in _Section 8.1_.

 



 

Section 8.4. _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by obligations of the Sellers or the Purchaser or their respective
Affiliates pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange or in order to enforce a partyÂ’s rights or remedies under this
Agreement, the Sellers, on the one hand, and BH and the Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing any other press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the activities and
operations of the other and shall not issue any such release or make any such
statement without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 8.5. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other
communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if
in writing and (a) at the time personally delivered if served by personal
delivery upon the party hereto for whom it is intended, (b) at the time
received if delivered by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt

 



     

 

 



 

requested) or by a national courier service (delivery of which is confirmed),
