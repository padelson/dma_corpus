        Company Common Stock (including the related Rights) tendered pursuant to
        the Offer shall be subject only to the condition that there

        shall be validly tendered (other than by guaranteed delivery where
        actual delivery has not occurred) in accordance with the terms of the
        Offer, prior to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a
        number of shares of Company Common Stock that, together with the shares
        of Company Common Stock then owned by the Parent and/or the Purchaser,
        represents at least a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock
        outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving effect to the
        conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other
        rights to acquire, and securities exercisable or convertible into,
        Company Common Stock, whether or not exercised or converted at the time
        of determination, other than potential dilution attributable to the
        Rights) (the "Minimum Condition") and to the satisfaction or waiver by
        the Purchaser as permitted hereunder of the other conditions set forth
        in Annex I hereto. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to
        purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and the related letter of
        transmittal, each in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
        containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions set
        forth in Annex I. Without limiting the foregoing, effective upon
        Consummation of the Offer (as defined in Section 1.4), the holder of
        such Company Common Stock (including the related Rights) will sell and
        assign to the Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all of
        the shares of Company Common Stock tendered (including, but not limited
        to, such holder's right to any and all dividends and distributions with
        a record date before, and a payment date after, the scheduled or
        extended expiration date).

               (b) The Purchaser expressly reserves the right, subject to
        compliance with the Exchange Act, to waive any of the conditions to the
        Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
        provided that (i) the Minimum Condition may not be waived or changed
        without the prior written consent of the Company and (ii) no change may
        be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid, decreases the
        Offer Price, decreases the number of shares of Company Common Stock
        sought in the Offer, adds additional conditions to the Offer, modifies
        any of the conditions to the Offer in a manner adverse to holders of
        Company Common Stock, makes any other change in the terms of the Offer
        that is in any manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock
        or (except as provided in the next sentence and in Section 1.1(c))
        changes the expiration date of the Offer, without the prior written
        consent of the Company. Without the consent of the Company, the
        Purchaser shall have the right to extend the expiration date of the
        Offer (which shall initially be 12:00 midnight Eastern time on the date
        that is the twentieth business day from the commencement date of the
        Offer, pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) from time to time
        for one or more additional periods of not more than 10 business days (5
        business days if only the Minimum Condition remains to be satisfied) (or
        such longer period as may be approved by the Company), (i) if,
        immediately before the scheduled or extended expiration date of the
        Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied
        or, to the extent permitted, waived, until such conditions are satisfied
        or waived or (ii) for any period required by any rule, regulation,
        interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission or
        the staff thereof (the "SEC") applicable to the Offer or any period
        required by applicable law.



                                      -2-
<PAGE>   9

        If the Purchaser elects to extend the expiration date pursuant to the
        immediately preceding sentence when the only Offer Condition that is not
        satisfied (or waived by the Purchaser) is the Minimum Condition, to the
        extent requested in writing by the Company (which request must be
        delivered on or before the expiration date), the Purchaser and the
        Parent shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived all of the Offer
        Conditions other than the Minimum Condition. In addition, if, at the
        scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, conditions to the
        Offer have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Condition has been
        satisfied but Company Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
        to the Offer constitutes less than 90 percent of the outstanding Company
        Common Stock, without the consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall
        (subject to applicable law) have the right to provide for a "subsequent
        offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act)
        for up to 20 business days after the Purchaser's acceptance for payment
        of the shares of Company Common Stock then tendered and not withdrawn
        pursuant to the Offer.

               (c) If any of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied or
        waived on any scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, the
        Purchaser shall, and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, extend the
        Offer, if such condition or conditions could reasonably be expected to
        be satisfied, from time to time until such conditions are satisfied or
        waived; provided, that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the
        Offer beyond the Outside Date. Subject to the foregoing and upon the
        terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, the Purchaser shall,
        and the Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for, as
        promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer and in
        accordance with Rule 14e-1(c) of the SEC (or as required by Rule 14d-11
        under the Exchange Act), all shares of Company Common Stock validly
        tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

               (d) No later than the first business day following execution of
        this Agreement and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
        Parent shall issue a joint press release with the Company (the "Joint
        Press Release") regarding this Agreement and its intent to make the
        Offer and shall file with the SEC the Joint Press Release, under cover
        of Schedule TO, indicating on the front of such Schedule TO that such
        filing contains pre-commencement communications.

               (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Parent and the
        Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
        TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
        the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The
        Schedule TO will include or incorporate by reference as exhibits the
        Offer to Purchase and forms of the letter of transmittal and summary
        advertisement (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments
        thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Parent and the Purchaser will take
        all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
        holders of shares of Company Common Stock to the extent required by
        applicable federal securities law. The



                                      -3-
<PAGE>   10

        Parent, the Purchaser and the Company each agree promptly to correct any
        information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
        extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
        any material respect. The Parent and the Purchaser agree to take all
        steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed
        with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated
        to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the
        extent required by applicable federal securities law, including
        applicable SEC rules and regulations thereunder. The Company and its
        counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
        the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to their being filed with
        the SEC or disseminated to the holders of shares of Company Common
        Stock. The Purchaser and the Parent also agree to provide the Company
        and its counsel in writing with any comments the Purchaser, the Parent
        or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
        the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
        such comments and shall consult with and provide the Company and its
        counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the response
        of the Purchaser to such comments prior to responding.

        Section 1.2   Company Action.

               (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer. The
        Company has been advised that all of its directors and executive
        officers who own shares of Company Common Stock intend to tender their
        shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer so long as such
        action would not result in liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
        Act. In connection with the Offer, the Company will, or will cause its
        transfer agent to, promptly furnish the Parent with a list of its
        stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
        containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of
        Company Common Stock and lists in the Company's possession or control of
        securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
        depositories, in each case as of a recent date, and will provide to the
        Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
        stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
        other assistance as the Parent may reasonably request in connection with
        the Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable statutes, laws
        (including common law), ordinances, rules or regulations (collectively,
        "Laws"), and, except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
        Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
        consummate the Offer and the transactions contemplated by this
        Agreement, the Parent and the Purchaser shall hold in confidence the
        information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use
        such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and,
        if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to
        the Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

               (b) No later than the first business day following execution of
        this Agreement, and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
        Company shall issue the Joint Press



                                      -4-
<PAGE>   11

        Release with the Parent and shall file with the SEC the Joint Press
        Release, under cover of Schedule 14D-9, indicating on the front of such
        Schedule 14D-9 that such filing contains pre-commencement
        communications.

               (c) On the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall
        file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common
        Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
        securities law, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
        14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
        "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect the recommendations of the Company
        Board. The Company, the Parent and the Purchaser each agree promptly to
        correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if
        and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
        material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to
        cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
        be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each
        case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities law.
        The Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
        review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with
        the SEC or disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock. The Company
        also agrees to provide the Parent and its counsel in writing with any
        comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC with
        respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
        comments and shall consult with and provide the Parent and its counsel a
        reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the response of the
        Company to such comments prior to responding.

        Section 1.3   Directors.

               (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for, and as long as
        the Parent directly or indirectly owns, not less than a majority of the
        issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted
        basis by the Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries
        pursuant to the Offer, the Parent shall be entitled to designate for
        appointment or election to the Company's then existing Board of
        Directors, upon written notice to the Company, such number of directors,
        rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors such that
        the percentage of its designees on the Board shall equal the percentage
        of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock owned of record by the
        Parent and its direct or indirect Subsidiaries. In furtherance thereof,
        the Company shall, upon request of the Purchaser, use its reasonable
        efforts promptly to cause the Parent's designees (and any replacement
        designees in the event that any designee shall no longer be on the Board
        of Directors) to be so elected to the Company's Board, and in
        furtherance thereof, to the extent necessary, increase the size of the
        Board of Directors or use its reasonable efforts to obtain the
        resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to
        give effect to the foregoing provision. At such time, the Company shall
        also, upon the request of the Purchaser, use its reasonable efforts to
        cause the Persons designated by the Parent to constitute at least the
        same percentage



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   12

        (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company's Board of
        Directors of (i) each committee of the Company's Board of Directors,
        (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the
        Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Board of
        Directors of the Company shall have at least two directors who are
        directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement and who are not
        officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Independent
        Directors"); provided, however, that (x) notwithstanding the foregoing,
        in no event shall the requirement to have at least two Independent
        Directors result in the Parent's designees constituting less than a
        majority of the Company's Board of Directors unless the Parent shall
        have failed to designate a sufficient number of Persons to constitute at
        least a majority and (y) if the number of Independent Directors shall be
        reduced below two for any reason whatsoever (or if immediately following
        Consummation of the Offer there are not at least two then-existing
        directors of the Company who (1) are Qualified Persons (as defined
        below) and (2) are willing to serve as Independent Directors), then the
        number of Independent Directors required hereunder shall be one, unless
        the remaining Independent Director is able to identify a person, who is
        not an officer or Affiliate of the Company, the Parent or any of their
        respective Subsidiaries (any such person being referred to herein as a
        "Qualified Person"), willing to serve as an Independent Director, in
        which case such remaining Independent Director shall be entitled to
        designate any such Qualified Person or Persons to fill such vacancy, and
        such designated Qualified Person shall be deemed to be an Independent
        Director for purposes of this Agreement, or if no Independent Directors
        then remain, the other Directors shall be required to designate two
        Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies, and such persons shall be
        deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

               (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant
        to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
        thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a),
        including mailing to stockholders the information required by such
        Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with
        the Schedule 14D-9 if it receives from the Parent and the Purchaser the
        information below on a basis timely to permit such mailing) as is
        necessary to fulfill the Company's obligations under Section 1.3(a). The
        Company's obligations to appoint the Parent's designees to the Company's
        Board of Directors shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of
        the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Parent or
        the Purchaser shall supply the Company in writing any information with
        respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and
        Affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary
        in connection with the appointment of any of the Parent's designees
        under Section 1.3(a). The provisions of Section 1.3(a) are in addition
        to and shall not limit any rights that the Purchaser, the Parent or any
        of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares
        of Company Common Stock as a matter of law with respect to the election
        of directors or otherwise.

<PAGE>   13

               (c) Following the election or appointment of the Parent's
        designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a), the approval by affirmative vote
        or written consent of all of the Independent Directors then in office
        (or, if there shall be only one Independent Director then in office, the
        Independent Director) shall be required to authorize (and such
        authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company's Board
        of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including
        any action by any committee thereof or any other director of the
        Company, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be required or
        permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this
        Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of
        any obligation or action hereunder by the Parent or the Purchaser or
        (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Company's rights under this
        Agreement.

        Section 1.4 Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. If following first
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock by the Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer (the "Consummation of the Offer") (or any subsequent
offering period), the Purchaser owns at least 90 percent of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, each of the parties hereto shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon
as practicable after such acquisition, without the Company Stockholder Meeting,
in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"Delaware Act").

merger, as the case may be) (the "Certificate of Merger") executed and

of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of the
Purchaser:

               (a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the

        deemed to be held by the Company regardless of whether the Company has,

        the holder thereof, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon
        surrender of the Certificate (as defined in Section 3.1) formerly
        representing such share in the manner provided in Section 3.2. All such
        shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
        automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
        a Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
        rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
        Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate in
        accordance with Section 3.2, without interest.

               (c) The term "Subsidiary" as used in this Agreement means any
        corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business
        entity 50 percent or more of the outstanding voting equity securities of
        which are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or the Parent,
        as applicable.

        administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
        other actions (if any) as may be required to effect the following:

                  (i)   each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock

                        of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Stock Plans;"
                        for the avoidance of doubt, the term "Stock Plan" does
                        not include the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan or
                        Deferred Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors)
                        which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior

                        pursuant to the Offer, with the holder thereof becoming
                        entitled to receive a payment in cash from the Company
                        in an amount equal to the product of (a) the excess, if

                        Option and (b) the number of shares of Company Common
                        Stock subject to such Stock Option; notwithstanding the

                        thereunder;

                        Company Common Stock or to receive benefits measured by
                        the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock,
                        that may be held, awarded, outstanding, credited,
                        payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans
                        (including, without limitation, restricted stock and
                        performance shares or awards), except for Stock Options
                        (each, a "Company Stock-Based Award") outstanding
                        immediately prior to the acceptance for payment of
                        shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
                        whether vested or unvested, shall fully vest (at the
                        maximum level of possible payout, if applicable), and
                        may be surrendered immediately prior to the acceptance
                        for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant

                        to receive a payment, in cash from the Company in an

                        Common Stock subject to such Company Stock-Based Award;

                  (iii) any cash payments required to be made pursuant to
                        Section 2.9(a)(i) or 2.9(a)(ii) are to be made (subject
                        to applicable withholding and payroll taxes) by the
                        Company promptly following the Consummation of the
                        Offer, but in any event within one business day
                        following Consummation of the Offer;

                  (iv)  each Stock Option granted under the Stock Plans that is
                        not surrendered for cash in accordance with Section
                        2.9(a)(i), and that is outstanding and unexercised
                        immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
                        canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time, with

                        share of the Company Common Stock subject to such Stock
                        Option and (b) the number of shares of Company Common
                        Stock subject to such Stock Option;

                   (v)    each Company Stock-Based Award that is not surrendered
                          for cash in accordance with Section 2.9(a)(ii), and
                          that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
                          Time, shall be cancelled immediately prior to the
                          Effective Time, with the holder thereof becoming

                          by the Surviving Corporation promptly following the
                          Effective Time, but in any event within one business
                          day following the Effective Time.

              (b) Except to the extent permitted by Section 6.3, no additional
        Stock Options, Company Stock-Based Awards or other equity-based awards
        or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock will be granted pursuant
        to the Stock Plans or otherwise after the date of this Agreement.

              (c) The Company Board, or applicable committee thereof, will grant
        all approvals and take all other actions required pursuant to Rules
        16b-3 under the Exchange Act to cause the disposition in the Merger of
        Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options to be
        exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

        Section 2.10 Conversion of the Purchaser Common Stock. Each share of the
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one
share of the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

                                    ARTICLE 3

                                     PAYMENT

        Section 3.1 Surrender of Certificates. From and after the Effective
Time, each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon surrender thereof to a paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") to be designated by the Parent prior to the Effective
Time with approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of Article
2 and this



                                      -11-
<PAGE>   18

Article 3. No interest will be payable on the Merger Consideration to be paid to
any holder of a Certificate irrespective of the time at which such Certificate
is surrendered for exchange.

        Section 3.2   Paying Agent; Certificate Surrender Procedures.

               (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
        Time, the Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
        Agent, an amount in cash sufficient to provide all funds necessary for
        the Paying Agent to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
        Section 2.8 (the "Payment Fund"). Pending payment of such funds to the
        holders of Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock, such funds
        will be held and may be invested by the Paying Agent as the Parent
        directs (so long as such directions do not impair the rights of holders
        of Company Common Stock) in the direct obligations of the United States,
        obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States is
        pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest or
        commercial paper rated of the highest quality by Moody's Investors
        Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation. Any net profit
        resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will
        be payable to the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the Parent
        directs. The Parent will promptly replace any monies lost through any
        investment made pursuant to this Section 3.2(a).

               (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
        the Parent will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder
        of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that
        delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
        Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the
        Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as
        the Parent will reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
        effecting the surrender of Certificates for the Merger Consideration.
        Commencing immediately after the Effective Time, upon the surrender to
        the Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with a
        duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and all other
        documents and other materials required by the Paying Agent to be
        delivered in connection therewith, the holder will be entitled to
        receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of
        Section 2.8.

        Section 3.3 Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of the Company will
be closed at the Effective Time and no transfer of any shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will thereafter be
recorded on any of the stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of any Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of the Company at the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration will be paid to the transferee in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.2(b) only if the Certificate is surrendered as provided
in Section 3.2 and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence of payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes.



                                      -12-
<PAGE>   19

        Section 3.4 Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund
which remains undistributed one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective
Time will be delivered to the Parent upon demand, and each holder of Company
Common Stock who has not theretofore surrendered Certificates in accordance with
the provisions of this Article 3 will thereafter look only to the Parent for
satisfaction of such holder's claims for the Merger Consideration.

        Section 3.5 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the fair
cash value of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock, as provided in
Section 262 of the Delaware Act, such shares shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration except as
provided in this Section 3.5, and the Company shall give the Parent notice of
any demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware Act received
by the Company, and the Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written
consent of the Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
an appraisal under Section 262 of the Delaware Act, the shares of Company Common
Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be treated as though
such shares had been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.8.

        Section 3.6 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.8.

        Section 3.7 No Rights as Stockholder. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates will cease to have any rights as a stockholder of
the Surviving Corporation except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable law, and the Parent will be entitled to treat each Certificate that
has not yet been surrendered for exchange solely as evidence of the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of Article 2
hereof and this Article 3, provided, however, that each holder of a Certificate
that has become entitled to any declared and unpaid dividend will continue to be
entitled to such dividend following the Effective Time, and the Surviving
Corporation will pay such dividend to such holder in the amount and on the date
specified therefor by the Board of Directors of the Company at the time of
declaration thereof.

        Section 3.8 Withholding. The Parent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
Company Common Stock all amounts relating to federal and state income and
payroll taxes required by law to be deducted or withheld therefrom.



                                      -13-
<PAGE>   20

        Section 3.9 Escheat. Neither the Parent, the Purchaser nor the Company
will be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any portion of
the Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. In the event any
Certificate has not been surrendered for the Merger Consideration prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, or prior to such earlier date as of which
such Certificate or the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender thereof
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity,
then the Merger Consideration otherwise payable upon the surrender of such
Certificate will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all rights, interests and
adverse claims of any person.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

        The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the Purchaser that
except as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 1999, and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or as disclosed in the
letter dated as of the date of this Agreement from the Company to the Parent
(the "Company Disclosure Letter"):

        Section 4.1 Organization. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
(a) a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as presently
being conducted, and (c) is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation and is duly qualified to conduct business as a foreign
corporation in each other jurisdiction where such qualification is required,
except, in the case of clauses (a) (as it relates to the Subsidiaries), (b) and
(c) above, where such failure, individually or in the aggregate, is not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, operations or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than changes or effects relating to the
economy in general, the securities markets in general or the shipbuilding or
defense industries in general and not specifically relating to the Company) or
the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement (a "Company Material Adverse Effect"). The
Company has delivered to the Parent correct and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as presently in effect, and, upon
request, will make available to the Parent after the date of this Agreement
correct and complete copies of the charters and bylaws, as presently in effect,
of each of its "significant subsidiaries", as such term is defined in Regulation
S-X of the Exchange Act (the "Significant Subsidiaries").

        Section 4.2 Authorization of Transaction; Enforceability. The Company
has full corporate power and authority and has taken all requisite corporate
action to enable it to execute


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   21

and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder, other than
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 6.8(d)), if
necessary, and the filing of the Certificate of Merger. The Board of Directors
of the Company, at a meeting thereof duly called and held, has duly adopted
resolutions by unanimous vote approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, determining that the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and recommending that the
Company's stockholders approve this Agreement. The foregoing resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company have not been modified, supplemented or
rescinded and remain in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.
In connection with its adoption of the foregoing resolutions, the Board of
Directors of the Company received the opinion (the "Opinion") of Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation, financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the
Company, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Offer Price and
the Merger Consideration are fair to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than the Parent and its affiliates), from a financial point of
view. The Company will deliver to the Parent a correct and complete copy of such
Opinion, promptly following receipt thereof. Assuming due execution and
authorization by the Parent and the Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principals of equity relating to enforceability.

        Section 4.3 Noncontravention; Consents. Except for (a) filings and
approvals necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the "blue sky" laws and regulations of various states, (b) the filing of
a Notification and Report Form and related material with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and any
other filing required pursuant to any other applicable competition, merger
control, antitrust or similar law or regulation (together with the HSR Act, the
"Antitrust Laws"), (c) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the
Delaware Act and any applicable documents with the relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business, (d) any filings required under the rules and regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange and (e) to the extent set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, will
constitute a violation of, be in conflict with, constitute or create (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration with respect to, or
result in the creation or imposition of any lien, encumbrance, security interest
or other claim (a "Lien") upon any property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any constitutional provision, law,
rule, regulation, permit, order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) any agreement or
commitment

                                      -15-

to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is bound
or subject, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such
matters which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital
        stock of the Company consists of 70 million shares of Company Common

        Company or one of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Lien other
        than Permitted Liens, except where the failure to be validly issued,
        fully paid or nonassessable is not reasonably likely to have a Company
        Material Adverse Effect. Except for its Subsidiaries, as of the date of
        this Agreement, the Company does not control directly or indirectly or
        have any direct or indirect equity participation in any corporation,

        required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
        statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
        made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file

        Company pursuant to this Agreement will comply in all material respects
        with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and will not, at
        the time the Schedule 14D-9 or the definitive Proxy Statement is filed
        with the SEC, as the case may be, and mailed to the stockholders of the
        Company, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state
        any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
        make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
        they were made, not misleading. No representation or warranty is made
        herein by the Company with respect to any information, if any, supplied
        by the Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 or
        the Proxy Statement. The information regarding the Company to be
        provided to the Parent and the Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule
        TO will not, at the time such information is provided, contain any
        untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact
        required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
        statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
        made, not misleading.

        Section 4.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company and its Subsidiaries

or unliquidated, or due or to become due) except for (a) liabilities and
obligations referenced (whether by value or otherwise) or reflected in the
Company SEC Documents, (b) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice, since December 31, 2000, and

        local or foreign jurisdiction, except for judgments, orders, decrees,
        stipulations, injunctions, charges, complaints, actions, suits,
        proceedings and hearings which, individually or in the aggregate, are

        the date of this Agreement, there are no judicial or administrative
        actions or proceedings pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
        threatened that question the validity of this Agreement or any action
        taken or to be taken by the Company in connection with this Agreement,
        which, if adversely determined, are reasonably likely to have a Company
        Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) Except for instances of noncompliance which, individually or
        in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
        Adverse Effect, and except for Taxes and Environmental Laws, which are
        the subject of Section 4.10 and Section 4.12, respectively, the Company
        and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with each constitutional

        agreement, other evidence of indebtedness, guarantee, license, lease,

        Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in writing or orally, that the
        Company or any of its Subsidiaries has breached or violated any law,
        rule, regulation, certification, representation, clause, provision or
        requirement pertaining to such Government Contract or Government

        entitled to all progress payments received to date with respect thereto,
        except in each such case for any such failure, noncompliance, breach,
        violation, termination, cost, investigation, disallowance or payment
        which, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to
        have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (c) To the Company's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of
        its Subsidiaries, any of the respective directors, officers, employees,
        consultants or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or

        investigation, indictment or information by any government or

        arising under or



                                      -20-
<PAGE>   27

        relating to any Government Contract or Government Subcontract except for
        any investigation, indictment, information or audit relating to matters
        which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
        have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (d) There exist (i) no material outstanding claims against the
        Company or any of its Subsidiaries, either by any government or
        governmental agency or by any prime contractor, subcontractor, vendor or
        other person or entity, arising under or relating to any Government
        Contract or Government Subcontract, and (ii) no disputes between the
        Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the United States government
        under the Contract Disputes Act or any other federal statute or between
        the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any prime contractor,
        subcontractor or vendor arising under or relating to any Government
        Contract or Government Subcontract, except for any such claim or dispute
        which, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to
        have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of
        its Subsidiaries has (i) any interest in any pending or potential
        material claim against any government or governmental agency or (ii) any
        interest in any pending claim against any prime contractor,
        subcontractor or vendor arising under or relating to any Government
        Contract or Government Subcontract, which, if adversely determined
        against the Company, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably
        likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (e) Since January 1, 2000, neither the Company nor any of its
        Subsidiaries has been debarred or suspended from participation in the
        award of contracts with the United States government or any other
        government or governmental agency (excluding for this purpose
        ineligibility to bid on certain contracts due to generally applicable
        bidding requirements). To the Company's knowledge, there exists no facts
        or circumstances that would warrant the institution of suspension or
        debarment proceedings or the finding of nonresponsibility or
        ineligibility on the part of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
        of their respective directors, officers or employees. No payment has
        been made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
        connection with any Government Contract or Government Subcontract in
        violation of applicable procurement laws, rules and regulations or in
        violation of, or requiring disclosure pursuant to, the Foreign Corrupt
        Practices Act, as amended, except for any such violation or failure to
        disclose which, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably
        likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        thereto (collectively "Tax Returns"), relating to any federal, state,
        local or foreign net income, gross income, gross receipts, sales, use,
        ad valorem, transfer,

        local or foreign law, rule or regulation), and any liability in respect
        of any tax as a transferee or successor, by law, contract or otherwise
        (collectively "Taxes"), and all such Tax Returns are accurate and
        complete in all respects, except to the extent any such failure to file
        or any such inaccuracy in any filed Tax Return, individually or in the
        aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
        Effect. All Taxes owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
        (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid or adequately
        reserved for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
        in the financial statements of the Company, except to the extent any
        such failure to pay or reserve, individually or in the aggregate, is not
        reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) No deficiency with respect to Taxes has been proposed,
        asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
        no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are
        pending, except (i) requests for waivers for income Taxes for periods
        referred to in Section 4.10(c) (or subsequent periods) or (ii) to the
        extent any such deficiency or request for waiver, individually or in the
        aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
        Effect.

               (c) The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the periods, as of
        the date of this Agreement, of the federal income Tax Returns of the
        Company and its Subsidiaries being examined by the Internal Revenue
        Service.

               (d) Except for Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable or
        which are being contested in good faith, there is no Lien affecting any
        of the assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
        that arose in connection with any failure or alleged failure to pay any
        Tax, except for Liens which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
        reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
        to any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement with any person other
        than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the agreement
        dated as of December 11, 1996 between the Company, Tenneco Inc., New
        Tenneco Inc. and El Paso National Gas Company.

        material employee pension benefit plan (an "Employee Pension Benefit
        Plan") as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, and each other material
        employee benefit plan, agreement, program or arrangement or employment
        practice maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
        respect to any of its current or former employees or to which the
        Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries contributes or is required to
        contribute with respect to any of its current or former employees
        (collectively, the "Company Plans"). With respect to each Company Plan:

                      (i) such Company Plan (and each related trust, insurance
               contract or fund) has been administered in a manner consistent in
               all respects with its written terms and complies in form and
               operation with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the
               Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and other
               applicable laws, except for failures of administration or
               compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
               reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

                      (ii) all required reports and descriptions (including Form
               5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports, PBGC-1's and Summary
               Plan Descriptions) have been filed or distributed appropriately
               with respect to such Company Plan, except for failures of filing
               or distribution which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
               reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

                      (iii) the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
               of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code have been met with respect
               to each such Company Plan which is an Employee Welfare Benefit
               Plan, except for failures which, individually or in the
               aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
               Adverse Effect;

                      (iv) all material contributions, premiums or other
               payments (including all employer contributions and employee
               salary reduction contributions) that are required to be made
               under the terms of any Company Plan have been timely made or have
               been reflected on the financial statements contained in the
               Company's most recent Form 10-K or Form 10-Q included in the
               Company SEC Documents except for failures which, individually or
               in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company
               Material Adverse Effect;

                      (v) each such Company Plan which is an Employee Pension
               Benefit Plan (other than a plan that is exempt from the
               requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA) intended to
               be a "qualified plan" under Section 401(a) of the Code has
               received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
               Revenue Service, and no event has occurred which could reasonably
               be expected to cause the loss, revocation or denial of any such
               favorable determination letter except

<PAGE>   30

               where the lack of a favorable determination letter is not
               reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

                      (vi) the Company has made available and will continue to
               make available to the Parent, upon its request, correct and
               complete copies of the plan documents and most recent summary
               plan descriptions, the most recent determination letter received
               from the Internal Revenue Service, the most recent Form 5500
               Annual Report, the most recent actuarial report, the most recent
               audited financial statements, and all related trust agreements,
               insurance contracts and other funding agreements that implement
               such Company Plan (but excluding the failure to make available
               any such document which is not material). The valuation summaries
               provided by the Company to the Parent reasonably represent the
               assets and liabilities attributable to each Company Plan which is
               an Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any "multiemployer
               plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA ("Multiemployer
               Plan")) or an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan providing retiree
               medical or life benefits calculated in accordance with the
               Company's past practices, but excluding any failure which,
               individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to
               have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

                      (vii) no Company Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit
               Plan has been amended in any manner which would require the
               posting of security under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or
               Section 307 of ERISA, except any such action which, individually
               or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company
               Material Adverse Effect; and

                      (viii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
               communicated to any employee (excluding internal memoranda to
               management) any plan or commitment, whether or not legally
               binding, to create any additional material employee benefit plan
               or to materially modify or change any Company Plan affecting any
               employee or terminated employee of the Company or any of its
               Subsidiaries, except any such action which, individually or in
               the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company
               Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) With respect to each Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or
        Employee Pension Benefit Plan that the Company or any of its
        Subsidiaries maintains or ever has maintained, or to which any of them
        contributes, ever has contributed or ever has been required to
        contribute:

                      (i) no such Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any
               Multiemployer Plan) has been completely or partially terminated
               (other than any termination which, individually or in the
               aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
               Adverse Effect), no reportable event (as defined in Section 4043
               of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
               waived, as to which notices would be required to be filed with
               the Pension Benefit



                                      -24-

               Guaranty Corporation, has occurred but has not yet been so
               reported (but excluding any failure to report which,
               individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to
               have a Company Material Adverse Effect), and no proceeding by
               the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to terminate such
               Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer
               Plan) has been instituted;

                      (ii) there have been no non-exempt prohibited transactions
               (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code)
               with respect to such plan, no fiduciary has any liability for
               breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in
               connection with the administration or investment of the assets of
               such plan, and no action, suit, proceeding, hearing or, to the
               Company's knowledge, investigation with respect to the
               administration or the investment of the assets of such plan
               (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the
               Company's knowledge, threatened, but excluding, from each of the
               foregoing, events or circumstances which, individually or in the
               aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
               Adverse Effect; and

                      (iii) other than routine claims for benefits, none of the
               Company or any of its Subsidiaries or related entities has
               incurred, and the Company has no reason to expect that the
               Company or any of its Subsidiaries or related entities will
               incur, any liability under Subtitle C or D Title IV of ERISA or
               under the Code with respect to any Company Plan that is an
               Employee Pension Benefit Plan, other than liabilities which,
               individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
               have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

               (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries presently
        contributes to, nor, since January 1, 1997, have they been obligated to
        contribute to, a Multiemployer Plan, other than obligations which,
        individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
        Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (d) Other than pursuant to a Company Plan, neither the Company
        nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide medical,
        health, life insurance or other welfare benefits for current or future
        retired or terminated employees, their spouses or their dependents
        (other than in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code), other than
        obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably
        likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(e) of the Company
        Disclosure Letter, no Company Plan contains any provision that would
        prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would give
        rise to any severance, termination or other payments as a result of the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with the
        occurrence of any other event), or would cause any payment, acceleration
        or increase in benefits provided by any Company Plan as a result of the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with the
        occurrence of



                                      -25-
<PAGE>   32

        any other event), but excluding any benefit acceleration or increase
        which would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.12  Environmental Matters.

               (a) Except for matters which, individually or in the aggregate,
        are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i)
        the Company and its Subsidiaries are, and, to the Company's knowledge,
        since January 1, 1999 have been in compliance in all respects with all

        1999 that are currently outstanding and unresolved as of the date of

        its Subsidiaries have responsibility, (iv) there are no administrative,
        civil or criminal writs, injunctions, decrees, orders or judgments
        outstanding or any administrative, civil or criminal actions, suits,

        conducted are anticipated to be required in the future in order to
        permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to comply in all
        material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws. The Company
        Disclosure Letter sets forth the amount reserved as of December 31, 2000

        the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 relating to the handling

        pursuant to valid license, sublicense, agreement or permission all items
        of Intellectual Property necessary for their operations as presently
        conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, except where the
        failure to have such rights, individually or in the aggregate, is not
        reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
        Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint,
        claim, demand or notice alleging any interference, infringement,
        misappropriation or violation of the

        Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2000, to the Company's
        knowledge, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
        misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual
        Property rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
        misappropriations and violations which, individually or in the
        aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
        Effect.

        means, collectively, patents, patent disclosures, trademarks, service

        manufacturing and production processes and techniques, research and
        development information, drawings, designs, plans, proposals and
        technical data, financial, marketing and business data and pricing and
        cost information) and all other intellectual property rights (in
        whatever form or medium).

        Section 4.15 Labor Matters. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no controversies pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their current or former employees
or any labor or other collective bargaining unit representing any such employee

reasonably likely to result in a material labor strike, dispute, slow-down or
work stoppage. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not aware of any
organizational effort presently being made or threatened by or on behalf of any
labor union with respect to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs ("OFCCP") or Equal Employment

Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no OFCCP conciliation agreements in effect.

        Section 4.16 Rights Agreement. The Company has taken all requisite
action under the Rights Agreement to cause the provisions of the Rights
Agreement not to be applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby and to provide for the expiration of the
Rights upon the Consummation of the Offer.

        Section 4.17 State Takeover Laws. The Board of Directors of the Company
has approved the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and, assuming the accuracy
of the Parent's and the Purchaser's representations in Section 5.5, such
approval is sufficient to render



                                      -28-
<PAGE>   35

inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby the restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in
Section 203 of the Delaware Act. To the Company's knowledge, no other "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share," "business combination," "affiliate
transaction," or other anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation of
any state is applicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

        Section 4.18 Brokers' Fees. Except for the fees and expenses payable by
the Company to Credit Suisse First Boston, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to
any financial advisor, broker, finder or agent with respect to the transactions

         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND THE PURCHASER

        Each of the Parent and the Purchaser, jointly and severally, represents

of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as presently being conducted and (c) is in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified to conduct business as a
foreign corporation in each other jurisdiction where such qualification is
required, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, where such failure,
individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operations or results of
operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than
changes or effects relating to the economy in general, the securities markets in
general or the industries in which the Parent operates in general and not

the Merger and to perform its obligations under this Agreement (a "Parent
Material Adverse Effect"). All of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of
the Purchaser have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are
owned by the Parent free and clear of any Lien. The Purchaser has been organized
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and has not engaged in any business other than
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent has delivered or otherwise made
available to the Company correct and complete copies of the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws, as presently in effect, of the Parent and the

resolutions of each such Board of Directors have not been modified, supplemented

filings required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange,

acceleration with respect to, or result in the creation or imposition or any
Lien upon any property of the Parent or the Purchaser, or result in the breach
of (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Parent or the
Purchaser, (ii) any constitutional provision, law, rule, regulation, permit,
order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree to which the Parent, the Purchaser
or any of their respective properties is bound or is subject or (iii) any
material agreement or commitment to which the Parent or the Purchaser is a party
or by which either of them is bound or subject.

Agreement.

Statement. The Schedule TO to be filed by the Purchaser and the Parent pursuant
to this Agreement will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and will not, at the time the Schedule TO is
filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

        Section 6.2   Notices and Consents.

               (a) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.1, each of the
        parties will give all notices to third parties and governmental entities
        and will use its respective best efforts to obtain all third party and
        governmental consents and approvals that are required in connection with
        the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably
        practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
        of the parties will file a Notification and Report Form and related
        material with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
        the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act, and will make
        all further filings pursuant thereto or any other Antitrust Law that may
        be necessary, proper or advisable, including using its best efforts to
        comply with any second requests for information in as expeditious a
        manner as practicable. The foregoing two sentences and Section 6.1 will
        not require the Parent to enter into any agreement, consent decree or
        other commitment requiring the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to
        dispose of or hold separate any material portion of its shares of
        Company Common Stock or of the business or assets of the Company and its
        Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as
        a whole, or (ii) to take any other action which, individually or in the
        aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
        Effect.

               (b) Neither the Parent, nor the Company will directly or
        indirectly extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
        agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior
        written consent of the Company or the Parent, respectively.

contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter,
as required by law or by the terms of any contract in effect on the date of this
Agreement or as the Parent may approve, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, from and after the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date, the Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
conduct its operations in accordance with its ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, and in accordance with such covenant will not,

        any collective bargaining agreement or consulting, executive or
        employment agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement or as
        required by applicable law, increase the compensation payable or to

        Effect; or

               (p) commit to do any of the foregoing.

        Section 6.4 Preservation of Organization. Subject to compliance with the

Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable efforts to preserve its business
organization intact in all material respects, use its reasonable efforts to keep

employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a group and use its reasonable
efforts to preserve the present relationships of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with suppliers and customers and others having business relations
with the Company and its Subsidiaries.

        Section 6.5 Access. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and their representatives to, afford the Parent and its representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice at reasonable times to all premises,
properties, books, records, contracts and documents of or pertaining to the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party will
be required to provide access or to disclose information (i) where such access
or disclosure would contravene any law or contract or would result in the waiver
of any legal privilege or work-product protection, or (ii) to the extent that
counsel for such party advises that such information should not be disclosed in

<PAGE>   41

        Section 6.6 Notice of Developments. The Company will give prompt written
notice to the Parent of any event which has had or is reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each party will give prompt written notice to
the other of any material development which would give rise to a failure of a
condition set forth in Annex I. No such written notice of such a material
development will be deemed to have amended any of the disclosures set forth in
the Company Disclosure Letter, to have qualified the representations and
warranties contained herein or to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such material
development.

        Section 6.7 Other Potential Acquirers.

               (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any Company
        Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any officer,
        director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other
        advisor or representative of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to,
        (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage the submission
        of, any Company Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section 6.7(e)), (ii)
        enter into any agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal
        (except a confidentiality agreement in accordance with this Section
        6.7(a)) or (iii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions
        or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with
        respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
        making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
        to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that prior
        to Consummation of the Offer (the "Company Applicable Period"), if the
        Company receives a proposal or offer that was not solicited by the
        Company and that did not otherwise result from a breach or deemed breach
        of this Section 6.7(a) and that the Board of Directors of the Company
        (the "Company Board") believes in good faith could result in a third
        party making a Company Superior Proposal, and subject to compliance with
        Section 6.7(c), the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to
        the Company to the person making such a proposal or offer pursuant to a
        customary confidentiality agreement the terms of which shall be no less
        favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality
        Agreement; provided, that no such agreement will be required to contain
        the provisions set forth in the sixth paragraph of the Confidentiality
        Agreement; and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
        person regarding such proposal or offer. Without limiting the foregoing,
        it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the
        preceding sentence by any executive officer of the Company or any
        Company Subsidiary or any affiliate, director or investment banker,
        attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company or any
        Company Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
        6.7(a) by the Company.

               (b) If the Company receives any Company Takeover Proposal which
        the Company Board determines is a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
        Board shall within 24 hours deliver to the Parent written notice
        advising the Parent that the Company Board has received such Company
        Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
        Company Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such

                                      -35-
<PAGE>   42

        Company Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company
        Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a third party to acquire,
        directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange
        offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
        liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration
        consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50 percent of the
        combined voting power of the shares of the Company Common Stock then
        outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
        otherwise on terms which the Company Board determines in its good faith
        judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
        recognized reputation) (A) is reasonably capable of being completed,
        taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
        of the proposal and the third party making such proposal, and (B)
        presents, in its entirety, more favorable terms, financial and
        otherwise, taken as a whole, to the Company's stockholders, than the
        terms of this Agreement.

               (c) The Company promptly shall advise the Parent orally and in
        writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to
        or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover
        Proposal, the identity of the person making any such Company Takeover
        Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any such Company Takeover
        Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep the Parent informed of the
        status of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any
        change to the material terms thereof).

               (d) Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee
        thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
        modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Purchaser, the
        recommendation of the Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger, or
        approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a
        Company Takeover Proposal, unless a withdrawal or modification of such
        recommendation is, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board after
        consultation with its outside counsel, required by its fiduciary duties.
        Nothing contained in this Section 6.7 shall prohibit the Company from
        taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
        Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
        required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
        judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
        failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
        applicable law.

               (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal"
        means any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution,
        liquidation, recapitalization or other business combination involving
        the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, any proposal or offer for the
        issuance by the Company of a material amount of its equity securities as
        consideration for the assets or securities of any person or any proposal
        or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, a material
        equity interest in any voting securities of, or a substantial portion of
        the assets of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

        Section 6.8 Company Stockholder Meeting, Preparation of Proxy Statement.
Subject to Section 1.4, as promptly as practicable following Consummation of the
Offer, if required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with applicable
law:

               (a) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting
        of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") for the purpose
        of considering and taking action upon the adoption of this Agreement;

               (b) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or
        information statement in accordance with the Exchange Act relating to
        the Merger and this Agreement and use its reasonable efforts to obtain
        and furnish the information required to be included by the Exchange Act
        and the SEC in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter defined) and, after
        consultation with the Parent, to respond promptly to any comments made
        by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information
        statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement,
        including any amendment or supplement thereto (the "Proxy Statement"),
        to be mailed to its stockholders, provided that no amendment or
        supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
        consultation with the Parent and its counsel;

               (c) subject to the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
        Delaware law and the provisions of this Agreement, include in the Proxy
        Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that stockholders of
        the Company vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement; and

               (d) use reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders
        proxies, and to take all other action necessary and advisable, to secure
        the vote of stockholders required by applicable law and the Company's
        certificate of incorporation or bylaws to obtain the approval for this
        Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). In the
        event a Company Stockholder Meeting is required under the Delaware Act
        in order to consummate the Merger, the Parent will provide the Company
        with the information concerning the Parent and the Purchaser required to
        be included in the Proxy Statement and will vote or cause to be voted
        all shares of Company Common Stock held by the Parent or its
        Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
        the transactions contemplated hereby.

        Section 6.9 Indemnification.

               (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Parent will cause the
        Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
        who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
        officer or director of the Company or any of its present or former
        Subsidiaries or corporate parents (collectively, the "Indemnified
        Parties") from and against all losses, claims, damages and expenses
        (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) ("Indemnified
        Losses") arising out of or relating to actions


                                      -37-
<PAGE>   44

        or omissions, or alleged actions or omissions, occurring at or prior to
        the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by
        the Delaware Act or any other applicable laws as presently or hereafter
        in effect. Furthermore, from and after the Closing Date, the Parent
        shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the directors and officers of
        the Company from all Indemnified Losses arising out of, or pertaining
        to, actions or omissions with respect to this Agreement and the
        transactions contemplated hereby.

               (b) Any determination required to be made with respect to whether
        any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification will, if
        requested by such Indemnified Party, be made by independent legal
        counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably satisfactory to
        the Surviving Corporation.

               (c) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Parent
        will cause to be maintained in effect the policies of directors and
        officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance currently
        maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from or
        relating to actions or omissions, or alleged actions or omissions,
        occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. The Parent may at its
        discretion substitute for such policies currently maintained by the
        Company directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
        liability insurance policies with reputable and financially sound
        carriers providing for no less favorable coverage. Notwithstanding the
        provisions of this Section 6.9(c), the Parent will not be obligated to
        make annual premium payments with respect to such policies of insurance
        to the extent such premiums exceed 300 percent of the annual premiums
        paid by the Company as of the date of this Agreement. If the annual
        premium costs necessary to maintain such insurance coverage exceed the
        foregoing amount, the Parent will maintain the most advantageous
        policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
        liability insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
        foregoing amount.

               (d) To the fullest extent permitted from time to time under the
        law of the State of Delaware, the Parent will cause the Surviving
        Corporation to pay on an as-incurred basis the reasonable fees and
        expenses of each Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and
        expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition of any action,
        suit, proceeding or investigation that is the subject of the right to
        indemnification, subject to reimbursement in the event such Indemnified
        Party is not entitled to indemnification.

               (e) The provisions set forth in Article Sixth of the Restated
        Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and in Section 14 of Article
        IV of the By-Laws of the Company, as in effect as of the date hereof,
        will apply to each director or officer, as applicable, of the Company
        with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time. The
        foregoing will not be deemed to restrict the right of the Surviving
        Corporation to modify the provisions of its certificate of incorporation
        or by-laws with respect to events or occurrences after the Closing Date
        but such modifications shall not adversely affect the rights of the
        directors hereunder. The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
        honor the provisions of this Section 6.9(e).


                                      -38-
<PAGE>   45

               (f) In the event of any action, suit, investigation or
        proceeding, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to control the
        defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable
        to the Parent, and the Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
        cooperate in the defense thereof, provided that neither the Parent nor
        the Surviving Corporation will be liable for the fees of more than one
        counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel, unless
        the use of a single counsel would make it impracticable or unethical for
        all Indemnified Parties to be represented by a single counsel, and
        provided further that neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
        will be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
        (which consent will not be reasonably withheld or delayed).

               (g) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder will be in
        addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
        certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or
        any of its Subsidiaries, under the Delaware Act or otherwise.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
        otherwise, the provisions of this Section 6.9 will survive the
        consummation of the Merger.

               (h) Nothing in this Section 6.9 will diminish any right or
        entitlements available to any director or officer of the Company under
        the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws as in effect as
        of the date of this Agreement.

               (i) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended for the
        benefit of and will be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or
        her heirs, executors and legal representatives.

        Section 6.10 Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be a Joint Press Release.
Thereafter, the Parent and the Company will consult with one another before
issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public announcements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as may be
required by applicable law or by the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such announcement
prior to such consultation.

        Section 6.11 Actions Regarding Antitakeover Statutes. If any fair price,
moratorium, control share acquisition or other form of antitakeover statute,
rule or regulation is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company will grant such approvals
and take such other actions as may be required so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

        Section 6.12 Defense of Orders and Injunctions. In the event either
party becomes subject to any order or injunction of a court of competent
jurisdiction which prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each party will use its best efforts to overturn or lift such
order or injunction. The foregoing will not be deemed to require



                                      -39-

the Parent to enter into any agreement, consent decree or other commitment
requiring the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to dispose of or hold
separate any material portion of its shares of Company Common Stock or of the
business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole or (ii) to take any action which,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

        Section 6.13 Employee Benefit Matters.

               (a) Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, with
        respect to the period beginning as of the Consummation of the Offer and
        ending on December 31, 2003, the Parent Corporation shall cause the
        employees and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
        "Employees"), to receive employee benefits pursuant to the Company Plans
        in effect immediately prior to the Consummation of the Offer.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenant of this Section 6.13(a)
        shall not apply to the following Company Plans: any annual cash bonus
        plan (provided however, that the Company's Annual Incentive Plan shall
        be maintained in respect of the period ending December 31, 2001, in
        accordance with its terms as in effect immediately prior to the
        Consummation of the Offer); the Continental Maritime Industries, Inc.
        Employee Stock Ownership Plan (provided that any proceeds of unallocated
        shares are allocated to participants after satisfaction of any
        outstanding indebtedness); the ESPAP; the Company 401(k) Investment Plan
        for Salaried Employees (the "Salaried 401(k) Plan") (provided that, for
        the period of this covenant, as soon as practicable following the
        Effective Time, Employees eligible to participate in the Salaried 401(k)
        Plan shall be eligible to participate in the Parent's Savings and Stock
        Investment Plan, as applicable to salaried employees located at the
        Parent's headquarters (the "Parent SSIP") or otherwise be eligible under
        the Salaried 401(k) Plan to receive the same benefits such Employees
        would have received had they participated directly in the Parent SSIP);
        the SECT; the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan and Deferred
        Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors; and any Stock Plan or
        similar equity or equity-based compensation plan, program or
        arrangement.

               (b) The Parent Corporation will honor and will cause the
        Purchaser to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, the
        obligations, as of the Consummation of the Offer, under the Company
        Plans, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
        combination with any other event). The Parent and the Company
        acknowledge and agree that the Consummation of the Offer and the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in
        control" for all purposes under the Company Plans.

                (c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the
        Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation)
        providing benefits to any Employees after the Effective Time, each
        Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the
        Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof)
        before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Employee was
        entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under
        any similar Company Plan; provided, however, that



                                      -40-
<PAGE>   47

        Employees shall not be entitled to any credit for benefit accrual
        purposes under any defined benefit pension plan in which they commence
        participation after the Effective Time in the absence of a transfer of
        assets and liabilities from any applicable prior defined benefit pension
        plan or to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits
        for the same period of service. Following the Effective Time, the Parent
        will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing
        condition limitation under any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan maintained
        by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Employees and their
        eligible dependents participate except to the extent that such
        pre-existing condition limitation would have been applicable under the
        comparable Company Employee Welfare Benefit plans immediately prior to
        the Effective Time), and (ii) provide each Employee with credit for any
        co-payments and deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time (or
        such earlier or later transition date to new Employee Welfare Benefits
        Plans) for the calendar year in which the Effective Time (or such
        earlier or later transition date) occurs, in satisfying any applicable
        deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that
        the Employees participate in after the Effective Time.

               (d) The Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and
        their respective representatives to, afford any officer (as of
        immediately prior to the Consummation of the Offer) of the Company and
        any of his or her representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable
        notice, to such books and records of the Company and the Surviving
        Corporation as are reasonably required by such officer to determine
        amounts owing to such officer under any Company Plan.

               (e) The Company will amend the SECT as set forth in the Company
        Disclosure Letter and will take all necessary actions to terminate the
        SECT following Consummation of the Offer, in accordance with Section
        6.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

               (f) Nothing contained herein will create any rights in any third
        party, including without limitation, any right to employment or right to
        any particular benefit except as set forth in Section 6.13(b) and
        6.13(d). Except as specifically provided in this Section 6.13, nothing
        contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting in any
        way the right of the Parent Corporation or the Company (or any successor
        thereto) to modify, amend or terminate any employee benefit plan,
        program or arrangement in whole or in part at any time after the
        Effective Time.

               (g) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
        the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
        administering the Employee Stock Purchase and Accumulation Plan (the
        "ESPAP")) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (if
        any) as may be required to provide that (i) with respect to the offering
        period under the ESPAP under way immediately prior to the Effective
        Time, the scheduled exercise date shall be accelerated, and all
        unexercised rights granted in respect of such offering period shall be
        exercised not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
        all holding periods with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under


                                      -41-
<PAGE>   48

        the ESPAP shall be waived immediately prior to the Consummation of the
        Offer so as to permit the holders thereof to accept the Offer, and (iii)
        the ESPAP shall terminate at the Effective Time.

        Section 6.14 Standstill Provisions. The restrictions on the Parent and
the Purchaser contained in the sixth paragraph of the Confidentiality Agreement
between the Parent and the Company are hereby waived by the Company to the
extent reasonably required to permit the Parent and the Purchaser to comply with
their obligations or enforce their rights under this Agreement.

        Section 6.15 Number of Shares Necessary for Minimum Condition. The
Company will promptly notify the Parent in the event that the number of shares
of Company Common Stock required to satisfy the Minimum Condition exceeds
19,307,716.

        Section 6.16 Adjustment to Offer Price. In the event there shall occur a
Distribution Date (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement), at any time
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Consummation of the
Offer, the Company and the Parent shall mutually agree to make such adjustment
to the Offer Price so as to preserve the economic benefits that the Company and
the Parent reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as a
result of the Consummation of the Offer and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 6.17 Parent Actions Following Consummation of the Offer.
Following the Consummation of the Offer, the Parent will appoint to its Board of
Directors William P. Fricks.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                  CONDITIONS TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

        Section 7.1 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party. The respective
obligation of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction at
or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following conditions:

               (a) this Agreement shall have been adopted by the requisite vote
        of the stockholders of the Company, if required by applicable law, in
        order to consummate the Merger; and

               (b) Consummation of the Offer shall have occurred; and

               (c) no party will be subject to any order or injunction of a
        court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint which prohibits
        the consummation of the Merger.

        Section 7.2 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, the
Parent or the Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.1, to be satisfied if



                                      -42-
<PAGE>   49

such party's breach of this Agreement has been a principal reason that such
condition has not been satisfied.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

        Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, if necessary:

                (a)     by mutual written consent of the Parent, the Purchaser
                        and the Company;

                (b)     by either the Parent or the Company:

                        (i)     if Consummation of the Offer does not occur on
                                or before November 30, 2001 (the "Outside
                                Date"), unless such failure is the result of a
                                material breach of this Agreement by the party
                                seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided,
                                however, that the Company may extend such date
                                to April 30, 2002, if at the initial Outside
                                Date the only conditions to the Offer not
                                satisfied (or waived by the Purchaser) are the
                                Minimum Condition and the conditions set forth
                                in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(i) of Annex I;

                        (ii)    if any court of competent jurisdiction in the
                                United States issues a final order, decree or
                                ruling or takes any other final action
                                permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
                                prohibiting the Offer or the Merger and such
                                order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
                                become final and nonappealable, unless such
                                order, decree, ruling or other action is the
                                result of a material breach of this Agreement by
                                the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;
                                or

                        (iii)   if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting to obtain
                                the Company Stockholder Approval, if necessary,
                                the Company Stockholder Approval is not
                                obtained, unless such failure to obtain the
                                Company Stockholder Approval is the result of a
                                material breach of this Agreement by the party
                                seeking to terminate this Agreement;

                (c)     by the Parent prior to the Consummation of the Offer:

                        (i)     if the Company breaches or fails to perform in
                                any material respect any of its representations,
                                warranties or covenants contained in this
                                Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
                                (A) would give rise to the failure of a
                                condition set forth in Annex I, and (B) cannot
                                be or

                                      -43-

                                giving of written notice to the Company of such
                                breach; or

                        (ii)    if (A) the Company, or the Company Board, as the
                                case may be, shall have (1) after the date
                                hereof, entered into any agreement, other than a
                                confidentiality agreement permitted under
                                Section 6.7(a), with respect to any Company
                                Takeover Proposal other than the Offer or the
                                Merger, (2) amended, conditioned, qualified,
                                withdrawn, modified or contradicted, or resolved
                                to do any of the foregoing, in a manner adverse
                                to the Parent or the Purchaser, its approval and
                                recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this
                                Agreement (regardless of whether such action was
                                permitted under this Agreement), (3) solicited,
                                approved or recommended any Company Takeover
                                Proposal other than the Offer or the Merger, or
                                (4) violated Section 6.7, or (B) the Company or
                                the Company Board, or any committee thereof,
                                shall have resolved or agreed, in writing or
                                otherwise, to do any of the foregoing; provided
                                that (x) any disclosure by the Company to its
                                stockholders of information that in its good
                                faith judgment, after consultation with outside
                                counsel, is required by Law shall not be deemed
                                to constitute any of the actions referred to in
                                the foregoing clauses (A)(2) and A(3) so long as
                                such disclosure does not change the Company
                                Board's approval or recommendation of the Offer,
                                the Merger or the Agreement and (y) any action
                                taken by the Company Board consistent with
                                Section 8.1(d)(ii), or any announcement of any
                                such action, shall not constitute any of the
                                actions described in the foregoing clauses
                                (A)(2), (A)(3) and (B);

                (d)     by the Company prior to the Consummation of the Offer:

                        (i)     if the Parent breaches or fails to perform in
                                any material respect any of its representations,
                                warranties or covenants contained in this
                                Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
                                (A) would give rise to the failure of a
                                condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) or 7.1(b),
                                and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within
                                30 days after the giving of written notice to
                                the Parent of such breach; or

                        (ii)    if at any time prior to Consummation of the
                                Offer (A) a Company Superior Proposal is
                                received by the Company and (B) the Company
                                complies with Section 6.7; provided that the
                                Company may not terminate this Agreement
                                pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(ii) unless and
                                until: (1) three business days have elapsed
                                following delivery to the Parent of a written
                                notice of such determination by the Company
                                Board and during such three business day period

                                the Company Superior Proposal and any proposed
                                amendments to this Agreement; (2) at the end of
                                such three business day period the Company
                                Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
                                Company Superior Proposal (taking into account
                                any modifications to the terms hereof proposed
                                by the Parent) and the Company Board confirms
                                its determination (after consultation with
                                outside counsel) that it is a Company Superior
                                Proposal; (3) following such termination the
                                Company enters into a definitive acquisition,
                                merger or similar agreement to effect the
                                Company Superior Proposal; and (4) the Company
                                prior to such termination pays to the Parent in
                                immediately available funds the Termination Fee
                                (as defined in Section 8.3).

        Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or the Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company, (except
for any liability of any party then in willful material breach of any covenant
or agreement); provided that the provisions of this Section 8.2 and Section 8.3
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect notwithstanding such
termination and abandonment.

        Section 8.3   Termination Fee.

                (a)     The Company shall pay to the Parent a fee of $50,000,000
        (the "Termination Fee") if:

                                Section 8.1(c)(ii) or the Company terminates
                                this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii),
                                which payment shall be payable on the date this
                                Agreement is terminated;

                        (ii)    in the event (A) a Company Takeover Proposal
                                shall have been publicly announced or any person
                                has publicly announced an intention (whether or
                                not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to
                                make a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) the
                                Consummation of the Offer shall not have
                                occurred prior to the Outside Date, (C) on the
                                Outside Date, the only condition to the Offer
                                that shall not have been satisfied shall be the
                                Minimum Condition, (D) the Agreement is
                                thereafter terminated by either the Parent or
                                the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and
                                (E) within 12 months after such termination, the
                                Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
                                enters into an agreement with respect to, or
                                consummates, such Company Takeover Proposal; or

<PAGE>   52


                        (iii)   in the event (A) there is a publicly announced
                                Company Takeover Proposal, (B) the Company
                                thereafter breaches one of its covenants in this
                                Agreement, (C) the Parent thereafter terminates
                                this Agreement under Section 8.1(c)(i) by reason
                                of such breach, and (D) within 12 months after
                                such termination, the Company or any of its
                                Significant Subsidiaries enters into an
                                agreement with respect to, or consummates, such
                                Company Takeover Proposal;

        provided that with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) no fee shall be
        payable by the Company until and unless the agreement is entered into or
        the Company Takeover Proposal is actually consummated within the 12
        months following such termination and shall be payable on the earlier of
        (y) the date the agreement is entered into or (z) the Company Takeover
        Proposal is consummated. Any fee due under this Section 8.3 shall be
        paid to the Parent by certified check or wire transfer of same-day funds
        on the date payable under this Section 8.3.

               (b) Except as specifically provided in this Section 8.3, each
        party will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such
        transactions are consummated.

               (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements regarding the
        payment of fees contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of
        the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, in the absence
        of such agreements, the Parent and the Purchaser would not have entered
        into this Agreement. The Company accordingly agrees that in the event
        the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee promptly, the Company will
        in addition to the payment of such amount also pay to the Parent all of
        the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
        and expenses) incurred by the Parent in the enforcement of its rights
        under this Section 8.3, together with interest on such amount at a rate
        of 11 percent per annum from the date upon which such payment was due,
        to and including the date of payment. Provided that the Company was not
        in breach of the provisions of Section 6.7, payment of the Termination
        Fee will constitute full and complete satisfaction, and will constitute
        the Parent's sole and exclusive remedy for any loss, liability, damage
        or claim arising out of or in connection with any such termination of
        this Agreement or the facts and circumstances resulting in or related to
        this Agreement.

delegate any of such party's rights or obligations under or in connection with

provision of this Agreement will be valid or binding unless it is in writing and
is executed and delivered by or on behalf of the party against which it is
sought to be enforced.

        Section 9.6 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited
by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to
the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of this Agreement.

        Section 9.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously
in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of
more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute

        Section 9.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will not
confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than the Parent,
the Purchaser and the Company and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except for the provisions of Article 2 and Article 3 and except that
the respective beneficiaries as of the Closing Date of the provisions of Section
6.9 and Section 6.13(f) will, for all purposes, be third party beneficiaries of
the covenants and agreements contained therein and, accordingly, will be treated
as a party to this



                                      -48-
<PAGE>   55

Agreement for purposes of the rights and remedies relating to enforcement of
such covenants and agreements and will be entitled to enforce any such rights
and exercise any such remedies directly against the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation.

        Section 9.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents
referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties, written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject
matter hereof.

        Section 9.12 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent
and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party. The use of
the word "including" in this Agreement means "including without limitation" and
is intended by the parties to be by way of example rather than limitation. As
used in this Agreement, the qualification "to the Company's knowledge" and
clauses of similar effect will mean the actual knowledge by any executive
officer of the Company or of its Subsidiaries of the existence or absence of
facts which would contradict a particular representation and warranty of the
Company.

        Section 9.13 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties to this
Agreement submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties to this Agreement waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto.

        Section 9.14 Governing Law. ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION,
VALIDITY AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SCHEDULES HERETO WILL BE
GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAW, AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS, OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE.

                         CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

               The capitalized terms used in this Annex I which are not defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which this Annex I

refer to the Agreement to which this Annex I is attached.

               Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, the Purchaser
shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) promulgated under the

                expiration date of the Offer:

                        (i)     the Minimum Condition shall not have been

                        (ii)    the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
                shall not have expired or been terminated;

                (b)     any of the following conditions exists as of the
                expiration date of the Offer:

                        (i)     there shall have been any action taken, or suit
                or proceeding threatened or commenced, or any statute, rule,

                promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed
                applicable to the Offer or the Merger, in each case by any

                administrative agency or authority or court or legislative body
                or commission which is reasonably likely to have the effect of

                Parent's or the Purchaser's ownership or operation (or that of
                any of their respective Subsidiaries) of all or a material
                portion of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses or
                assets as a whole, or compelling the Parent or the Purchaser or
                their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any
                material portion of its shares of Company Common Stock or of the
                business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the
                Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole,
