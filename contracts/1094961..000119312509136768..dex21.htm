ARTICLE I. THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 Section 1.1 _The Offer._

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, within seven business days after the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all
Shares at the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in this Agreement, if
applicable) and in compliance with Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act and all
other provisions of applicable securities laws.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "), promptly after the latest of (i) the earliest date as of which
Purchaser is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, (ii) the earliest date as of which each of
the Offer Conditions has been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser, and
(iii) the Expiration Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment
each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
and promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer pay the Offer Price (without interest) for each Share validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser
(and of Parent to cause Purchaser) to accept for payment, and pay the Offer
Price (without interest) for, each Share validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or
waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of each of the Offer Conditions.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition (as defined in _Annex I_ ) and the other conditions set forth in
_Annex I_. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (x) increase the Offer
Price and (y) waive any Offer Condition and make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) decrease the maximum number
of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) impose conditions or
requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend or
modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects, or
reasonably could adversely affect, the holder of Shares, (vi) change or waive
the Minimum Condition, or (vii) extend or otherwise change the expiration date
of the Offer in a manner other than as required or permitted by this
Agreement.



 

2 (d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date that is 20 business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to
and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration
Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Offer
Conditions have not been satisfied (other than conditions which by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time), or waived by Parent or
Purchaser if permitted hereunder, then Purchaser may (or at the request of the
Company, Purchaser shall) extend the Offer for one or more successive periods
of 10 business days (or such other number of business days as may be jointly
determined by Purchaser and the Company) each in order to permit the
satisfaction of such conditions (subject to the right of the Purchaser to
waive any condition (other than the Minimum Condition) in accordance with
this Agreement), provided such extension of the Offer period does not extend
past the earlier of (x) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1 and (y) the date, as applicable, that is (A) 90 days after commencement
of the Offer (the " _Initial Outside Date_ "), or (B) 120 days after
commencement of the Offer in the event that the HSR Condition or the Banking
Moratorium Condition shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or
Purchaser if permitted hereunder, by the Initial Outside Date (the " _Extended
Outside Date_ "); and

(ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable law, rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or its staff or The NASDAQ
Stock Market LLC (the " _NASDAQ_ ") or its staff.

(f) If fewer than 90% of the number of outstanding Shares are accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer or acquired through the Offer and exercise of
the Top-Up-Option, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for one
"subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Additionally, in the event
that more than 80% of the then outstanding Shares have been validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer following the Expiration
Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), at the request of
the Company, provide for one "subsequent offering period" in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of at least 10 business days immediately
following the Expiration Date unless (i) Parent and Purchaser exercise the
Top-Up Option or (ii) Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries, in
the aggregate, own more than 90% of the outstanding Shares. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay the Offer Price
(without interest) for, each Share that is validly tendered and not properly
 



 

3  withdrawn pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period"
promptly after any such Share is tendered during such "subsequent offering
period." The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent
offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f).

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1.

(h) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares pursuant to the Offer. 

(i) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall
file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act ("
_Regulation M-A_ "), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, and
ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, and
together with the Schedule TO and any amendments and supplements thereto, the
" _Offer Documents_ "). The Company will provide to Parent and Purchaser any
information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates
required to be provided in the Offer Documents under applicable Laws or as
reasonably requested by Parent and Purchaser. Parent and Purchaser agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. Parent and
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents before
they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the holders of Shares, and
Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any such written responses before they are submitted to the SEC or
its staff, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. Each of Parent and Purchaser  



 

4  shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents or the Offer. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation, as such
Company Board Recommendation may be amended and for so long as such Company
Board Recommendation is not withdrawn (in each case as permitted by this
Agreement). If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer,
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository, acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(j) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(k) Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary
to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions._

(a) As promptly as practicable on the day the Offer is commenced, following
the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies
with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(c),
contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange
Act and all other applicable Laws. Parent and Purchaser will provide to the
Company any information with respect to Parent and Purchaser and their
respective officers, directors, Affiliates and agents required to be provided
in the Schedule 14D-9 under applicable Laws or as reasonably requested by the
Company. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Schedule 14D-9 shall be
mailed to holders of Shares with the Offer Documents (and if so, the expense
of such mailing shall be borne by Parent in connection with its dissemination
of the Offer Documents). The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable),
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC or disseminated to the holders
of Shares and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions,  



 

5  deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any
oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any such written responses before they
are submitted to the SEC or its staff and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. The Company shall respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and
any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of
the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings
and computer files and all other information known to the Company regarding
the beneficial owners of the Shares, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with
such information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of
holders of the Shares, updated promptly from time to time upon Purchasers
request, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions)
as Purchaser or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares.
Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver to the
Company all copies of such information.

Section 1.3 _Directors._

(a) Upon Purchaser accepting, for the first time, for payment and paying for
such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the " _Acceptance Time_ "),
and at all times thereafter, subject to compliance with the Company Charter
Documents, applicable Law and the applicable Marketplace Rules of the
NASDAQ, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of
Directors as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on
the Company Board of Directors (after giving effect to the directors elected
or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent,
Purchaser and any of their Affiliates bears to the total number of Shares
then outstanding. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request at any time
following the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, take
all such actions necessary to (I) appoint to the Company Board of Directors
the individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so designated by
the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including, but not limited to,
promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the
Company Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board
of Directors (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if necessary so
as to increase the size of the Company Board of Directors) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are
necessary or desirable  



 

6  to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors, and (II) cause Purchasers designees to be
so appointed at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request
following the Acceptance Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by
Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of each committee of the
Company Board of Directors to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. From and after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled
company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c) and make all necessary
filings and disclosures associated with such status. The Companys obligations
under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board
of Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with respect
to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers respective officers,
directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a
matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to
maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board of
Directors on or prior to the date hereof and who are not officers, directors
or employees of Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates, each of whom
shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the
NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ rules, and at least one of whom
shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 401(h)
of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to
serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take
all necessary action (including creating a committee of the Company Board of
Directors) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person
(or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three Persons who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates to fill such vacancies and such
Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in addition
to the approval rights of the Company Board of Directors or the
stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Company Charter
Documents or applicable Law) be required (i) for the Company to amend or
terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the Companys
rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would adversely
affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the holders of  



 

7  Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company Charter
Documents if such action would adversely affect the holders of Shares
(other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any other action of the
Company Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such
action would adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect, the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser).

Section 1.10 _Stockholders  Meeting._

If approval of the stockholders of the Company is required under DGCL in order
to consummate the Merger:

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time and the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, the Company shall
prepare and file as promptly as practicable with the SEC a proxy or
information statement for the Special Meeting (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement; provided, that
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with the intention
that the Proxy Statement be in a form ready to print and mail to the
stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following the
Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if
applicable. Parent and Purchaser will provide to the Company any information
with respect to Parent and Purchaser and their respective officers, directors,
Affiliates and agents required to be provided in the Proxy Statement under
applicable Laws or as reasonably requested by the  



 

9  Company. The Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation
of the Company Board of Directors that stockholders of the Company vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. The
Company shall respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses before
they are submitted to the SEC or its staff and the Company shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company further agrees to
cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with
the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement as provided in Section 1.11(b)(ii), mailed to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or
its staff).

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law:

(i) (A) as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time and
the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, duly set a
record date for, call and give notice of a special meeting of the Companys
stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and
taking action upon this Agreement (with the record date and meeting date set
in consultation with Purchaser), and (B) as promptly as practicable following
the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if
applicable, convene and hold the Special Meeting; and

(ii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders.

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by
it, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other approvals that are required by the DGCL
and any other applicable Law to effect the Merger.

Section 1.11 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders._

Notwithstanding the terms of Section 1.10, in the event that Parent, Purchaser
and their respective Subsidiaries shall own of record, in the aggregate, at
least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the
Company entitled to vote on the adoption  



 

10  of this Agreement under the DGCL (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), following
the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if
applicable, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, Parent shall
cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable, without a
meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section  253 of
the DGCL.

Section 1.12 _Top-Up Option._

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, to purchase with a promissory note, bearing simple interest
at 6% per annum, and due 30 days after the Top-Up Closing (a " _Promissory
Note_ "), at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, that number of
shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest
number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries at
the time of such exercise, shall constitute 1,000 shares more than 90% of the
shares of Common Stock then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and
the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form
Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option
be exercisable for a number of shares of Common stock in excess of the
Companys total authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock
(including shares that are otherwise subscribed to or committed to be
issued). The obligation of the Company to issue shares will be subject to
compliance with all applicable regulatory and stock exchange requirements.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law or other legal impediment shall prohibit
the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares
pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal,
Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any one
time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1.

(c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ,"
the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_
") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing
the Top-Up Option Shares which the Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place,
time and date (which shall be no earlier than one business day after the Top-
Up Notice Date and no later than seven business days after the Top-Up Notice
Date) for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option
(the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the
Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming
the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor
(the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay
the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares, by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the amount specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares. Such certificates may include any
legends that are required by federal or state securities laws.



 

11 (d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ ") and will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not
involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the
Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-
Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being
and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act.

 ARTICLE II. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE

OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any Shares or of any shares of capital stock
of Purchaser:

(a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Purchaser shall be automatically converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other
than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). The Shares that are so converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) are referred to
herein as the " _Merger Shares_."

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without duplication to the effects
of Section 1.1(j), the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common
Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and  



 

12  which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or
consent thereto in writing or who otherwise did not validly waive their right
to appraisal) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such stockholders Shares shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each
such Share, in accordance with Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer
or agree to settle, any such demand for payment or waive any failure by a
stockholder to timely comply with the requirements of the DGCL to perfect or
demand appraisal rights. In any appraisal negotiations or proceeding, the
Company, Purchaser and Parent shall not assert that the number of shares of
the Company outstanding for purposes of determining fair value includes the
Top-Up Option Shares. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available
to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section  2.2 to pay for Shares for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

Section 2.2  _Exchange of Certificates._

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Merger Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of the Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest
or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be
payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Merger Share (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the certificates representing the Merger Shares
(the " _Certificates_ ") and to any uncertificated Merger Shares held in
book-entry form (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery
of the  



 

13  Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent,
and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as
is customary) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent), or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may require) in the
case of book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each Merger
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share, and
the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
transferred Uncertificated Shares is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares
shall be properly transferred and (y) the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II,
without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_.
The Merger Consideration paid in respect of the Merger Shares upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Merger Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Merger Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor, without interest, upon
compliance with the provisions of Section 2.2(b) or as otherwise provided by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such customary amount and upon such customary terms as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Merger Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.



 

14 (e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following 12 months after the Closing
Date, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been
made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Merger Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Certificates or transfer of any Uncertificated
Shares held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without
any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Offer Price and Merger Consideration otherwise payable to a holder
of Shares or of Merger Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so
withheld, (i) Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, shall remit such withheld amounts to the
applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.3 _Company Stock Options._

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that each option (other than Warrants) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) (each, an " _Option_ ") that represents the right to acquire
shares of Common Stock shall (i) be fully vested and exercisable, and (ii)
be cancelled and be of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time
(other than for the right to receive the cash payment, if any, contemplated by
the next sentence). Each holder of an Option that is (i) outstanding and
unexercised and (ii) has an Adjusted Exercise Price that is less than the
Merger Consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled
to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Option, an amount in cash
(such amount, the " _Net Option Consideration_ ") equal to the excess, if any,
of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the Adjusted Exercise Price of such
Option (including if such Adjusted Exercise Price is less than zero),
multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 2.3 the "Adjusted Exercise
Price" of each Option shall mean the per share exercise or "strike" price of
such Option minus the amount payable to such holder for each Share covered by
 



 

15  the Option pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement. Any such
payment shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements. For
the purpose of clarity, any unexercised Option with an Adjusted Exercise
Price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled upon
the Effective Time without payment. Neither the Company nor the Company Board
of Directors shall take any action, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise, to cause Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to (i)
assume any of the Company Stock Plans or any Option, (ii) substitute any
similar plan, option or restricted share for any of the Company Stock Plans
or any Option, or (iii) cause any of the Company Stock Plans or any Option to
continue in full force and effect following the Effective Time. Prior to or
promptly following the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation (as the case may be) shall mail to each person who is a holder of
an outstanding Option (regardless of whether such Option is or was vested or
exercisable at the Effective Time) a letter describing the treatment of
and payment for such Option pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Option in accordance with
this Section.

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate all the Company Stock Plans effective at or prior to the
Effective Time.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Company will not, at the Effective Time, be bound
by any options, stock appreciation rights, or other rights or agreements
which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own
any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in
respect thereof. 

Section 2.4 _Company Warrants._

At the Effective Time, any warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that provides the right to acquire shares of Common Stock
(each, a " _Warrant_ ") shall be converted into a right to receive, upon
exercise of such Warrant and payment of the exercise price in respect thereof,
a cash amount equal to the Warrant Consideration for each share of Common
Stock subject to such Warrant and for which such Warrant has been exercised.
The " _Warrant Consideration_ shall mean, with respect to any share of Common
Stock issuable under a particular Warrant, an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration.

Section 2.5 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan._

Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take any and all actions with
respect to the Companys 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the "
_ESPP_ ") as are necessary to provide that, subject to consummation of the
Merger, the ESPP shall terminate, effective on the date immediately prior to
the Closing Date (the " _ESPP Termination Date_ "). Prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company has taken all action (and provided Parent evidence
thereof) necessary to suspend the ESPP. As of the date of this Agreement, as
of the ESPP Termination Date and as of the Closing, no Rights (as defined in
the ESPP) are or will be outstanding under the ESPP providing any participant
in the ESPP with the right to purchase any shares of Common Stock, and the
Company has not taken any action and is not under any obligation to provide
for the future grant of any Rights under the ESPP. Prior to the Closing, the
 



 

16  Company shall not grant or provide for the grant of any Rights under the
ESPP to any participant thereunder or provide for any Offering or set any
Offering Date (each as defined under the ESPP).

ARTICLE III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows, except

not list individual awards, grants or accrued levels, if the plan, policy,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which such individual awards, grants, or
accrued levels relate is already listed on Section 3.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, is a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer
Plan_ "), is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section
3(40) of ERISA, or is or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall include

the Company or any Subsidiary under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA.



 

28 (b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to

the Company to the extent applicable: (i) any plans and related trust
documents, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, and all
amendments thereto (for the last three completed plan years); (ii) Forms 5500
and all schedules thereto for the last three (3) completed plan years, (iii)
the most recent actuarial report, if any; (iv) the most recent IRS

descriptions and any subsequent summary of material modification; (vi) written
summaries of all non-written Company Plans and (vii) any material
correspondence with the IRS, Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation.

(c) The Company Plans have been maintained, in all material respects, in
accordance with their terms and with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and other Laws. Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor to the
Knowledge of the Company, any other "disqualified person" or "party in
interest," as defined in Code Section 4975 and ERISA Section 3(14),
respectively, has engaged in any non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as
defined in Code Section 4975 or ERISA Section 406, with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan. No fiduciary violations under Title I of ERISA have
occurred with respect to any Company Plan.

(d) The Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 or for other tax-
favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code
have received a determination from the IRS that they are so qualified or are
the subject of a favorable opinion letter, and any trusts intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are so exempt. Nothing has
occurred with respect to the operation of the Company Plans that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption,
or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

(e) All contributions and benefits required to have been made or paid under
any of the Company Plans or by Law (without regard to any waivers granted
under Section 412 of the Code), have been timely made.

(f) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits arising from or relating
to the Company Plans or the assets thereof (other than routine benefit
claims), nor does the Company have any Knowledge of facts that could
reasonably be expected to form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit that
would, or would reasonably be expected to be, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(g) None of the Company Plans provide for post-employment life insurance or
health insurance coverage or benefits for any participant or any beneficiary
of a participant, except as may be required under Part 6 of the Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or as may be required under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, Title III, Section 3001, and at the expense of the
participant or the participants beneficiary.



 

29 (h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any rights with respect to benefits under
any such plan, or (iv) require any contributions or payments to fund any
obligations under any Company Plan.

Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than

of its Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes by the Company is not an
employee for such purposes.

(j) All arrangements that would be considered "deferred compensation" for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code are in compliance with Section 409A of
the Code. Each Company Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been administered in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section
409A of the Code and all applicable IRS and Treasury Department guidance
issued thereunder. None of the Transactions will result in a deferral of
compensation under any Company Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code. Each Option issued under any Company Plan (or any predecessor plan
providing for the issuance of Options to employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) that has been exercised has been properly treated by the
Company as an incentive stock option under Code Section 422 or as a
nonstatutory option, as applicable. All Options granted under any Company Plan
were granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date of grant of such Option and no Option has been
amended to reduce the exercise price from that in effect on the date of grant
(except pursuant to non-discretionary antidilution provisions governing such
Option).

its Subsidiaries is represented in his or her capacity as an employee of the

nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any labor organization been elected
as the collective bargaining agent of any employees, nor has the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries entered into any collective bargaining agreement or
union contract recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of
any employees. There is no union organization activity involving any of the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has there ever been union
representation involving any of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no picketing pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, and there are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages,
other job actions, lockouts, arbitrations, grievances or other labor disputes
involving any of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. There are no
complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that could be brought
or filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising out
of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination
of employment or failure to employ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
of any individual. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
Laws relating to the employment of labor, including all such Laws relating to

except for any immaterial non-compliance. There has been no "mass layoff" or

14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (an " _Employment Compensation
Arrangement_ "), and has taken all other action necessary to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor with respect to such Company
Compensation Arrangements in accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act.

applicable Law) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or that
constitute, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal;

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any third
party regarding any Takeover Proposal;

(iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or
other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with this Section 5.2(a)) (each, a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ "); or

(iv) release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the
waiver of any provision of or right under, any confidentiality, non-
solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights;



 

48 _provided_ , _however_ , that if after the date hereof and prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company Board of Directors receives a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal that was not solicited and was made in circumstances not
involving a breach of this Agreement, and the Company Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and determines, in good
faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, then the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and its Representatives may, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time (but in no event at or after the Acceptance Time) and
after providing Parent not less than 2 business days prior written notice of
its intention to take such actions, (A) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement
must be no less favorable to the Company (i.e., no less restrictive with
respect to the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement),
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision
calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) the
Company advises Parent of all such non-public information delivered to such
Person concurrently with its delivery to such Person and concurrently with its
delivery to such Person the Company delivers or makes available to Parent
or Parents legal counsel all such non-public information not previously
provided or made available to Parent or Parents legal counsel, and (B)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Takeover Proposal (including seeking revised Takeover Proposals from such
Person as part of such discussions and negotiations). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by the Companys Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.2 by the Company. The Company shall provide Parent
with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into
pursuant to this paragraph within 24 hours of the execution thereof.

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact is received by, any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall,
in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent fully informed
of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent
with copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(c), neither the Company
Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent (including pursuant to Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment thereto), the
Company Board Recommendation, or (ii) approve or recommend,  



 

49  or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any
action described in clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
Board of Directors may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (but in no
event at or after the Acceptance Time), make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, if: (1) the Company Board of Directors determines, in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law; (2) the Company shall have given Parent prior written
notice (a " _Change in Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent of its
intention to consider making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change at least
four business days prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
(3) if the decision to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in
connection with a Takeover Proposal, (A) the Company shall have provided
Parent with the material terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal in
compliance with Section 5.2(b) and (B) after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, the Company Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such proposed Takeover
Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (4) the Company shall have given Parent
four business days after delivery of each Change in Recommendation Notice to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal)
and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal, if any; and (5) after considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent, if any, (A) after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, the Company Board of Directors shall have continued to determine, in
good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (B) if the decision to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in connection with a Takeover
Proposal, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, the Company Board of Directors shall have continued to
determine, in good faith, that such proposed Takeover Proposal is a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event the Company Board of Directors does
not make the determinations referred to in clause (5) of this Section 5.2(c)
but thereafter determines to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 5.2(c), the procedures referred to in clauses (2),
(3), (4) and (5) above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any
subsequent Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer or indication of
interest (whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person or " _group_ " (as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, relating to any (A) direct
or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) equal 10% or more of the Companys consolidated
assets or to which 10% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 10%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (C) tender offer or
exchange offer (as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act) that if  



 

50  consummated would result in any Person or "group," other than Parent, and
its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, beneficially owning
10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or (D) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; in each case, other than (i) the Transactions, and (ii)
such other transactions as may be consented to by Parent in its sole
discretion.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal,
obtained after the date hereof and not in breach of this Agreement, to
acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, at least a majority of the equity interests of the Company or all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is otherwise on terms and
conditions which the Company Board of Directors determines, in its good faith,
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation (provided that, the Financial Advisor shall be considered
a financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, taking into account all
relevant factors at the time of determination, including, (i) the terms and
conditions of such proposal, including price, form of consideration, closing
conditions, the ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the
transactions contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among other things,
the availability of financing and the reasonable expectation of obtaining
required approvals) and other aspects of the proposal that the Company Board
of Directors deems relevant, and (ii) any changes to the terms of this
Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover Proposal, if the
Company Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would be
inconsistent with its legal obligations under applicable Laws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless, within seven business days of the earlier of the receipt or
commencement of the Takeover Proposal, the Company Board of Directors (x)
expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation or (y) rejects such
Takeover Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.2, the Company
shall not be entitled to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless
this Agreement has been or concurrently is validly terminated by its terms in
accordance with Article VII.



 

51 Section 5.3 _Approvals._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the Offer Conditions and
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including removing Restraints and preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions. Each of the parties shall provide the other parties, upon
request, with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Authority and, upon request, any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, consistent with applicable Laws and the other provisions
of this Agreement. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EC Treaty, Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003
of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid
down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004
of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, and
all other applicable Laws and guidelines (including any other Applicable
Foreign Competition Laws) that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 5.3, (i) the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to Governmental Authorities with regulatory
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Laws (a "
_Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") information and documents requested by any
Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the Transactions, including filing any notification and
report form and related material required under the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, but, in any event, any
notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act
shall be filed not later than seven business days following the date of this
Agreement, and thereafter to respond promptly to any request for additional
information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act and
(ii) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any
of the Transactions, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of
such Law on the Transactions. The parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions as are necessary or reasonably advisable to
obtain approval of consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or otherwise to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act.
The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all
objections and challenges, if any, that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust  



 

52  Laws, provided however that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither party shall have any obligation to defend through
litigation any claims asserted under the Antitrust Laws by any Governmental
Authority relating to consummation of the Transactions. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, each party hereto shall furnish to the other
parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (and in
no event shall any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent contained in
this Agreement be breached or deemed breached as a result of the failure of
Parent to) sell or otherwise dispose of, hold (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise), or divest itself of all or any portion of the business,
assets or operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the business,
assets or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries after the
Acceptance Time. In regard to any Governmental Authority, neither the Company
nor its Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent in Parents
sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss
or commit to alter any of their businesses or commercial practices in any
way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parents
freedom of action with respect to, or Parents ability to retain any of the
businesses, product or service lines or assets of, the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Acceptance Time or otherwise limits Parents ability to
receive the full benefits of this Agreement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any material communication from any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating
to proceedings under the Antitrust Laws, and shall provide to the Companys or
Parents outside antitrust counsel, as appropriate, all information and
documents reasonably requested by such counsel promptly upon request, subject
to any reasonable restrictions. The parties hereto may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 5.3 as "outside counsel
only" or "outside antitrust counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient or, in the case of "outside antitrust counsel only," to the outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel or outside antitrust counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from
the source of the materials of Parent and the Company.

Section 5.4 _Public Announcements._

The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement
shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the
Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect
to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except (a) as such release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall  



 

53  use its reasonable efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b)
as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, including Section 5.2(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company need
not consult with Parent in connection with any press release or public
statement to be issued or made with respect to any Takeover Proposal or with
respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, provided that the
Company has complied with Section 5.2.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable
advance notice to the Company, afford to Parent and Parents representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours to all of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form, and
including all material environmentally related audits, studies, reports,
analyses, and results of investigations performed with respect to the
currently or previously owned, leased or operated properties of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives and to all other information
concerning the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that any such
access shall be conducted at Parents expense, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Company and in a manner not to interfere with the
normal operation of the business of the Company; provided, further, however,
that the Company shall not be required to afford access, or to disclose any
information, that in the good faith judgment of the Company would (i) result
in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties, (ii) violate any
obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality, (iii) jeopardize
protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine, or (iv) violate any Law.

(b) The Company shall furnish or make available promptly to Parent a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to
the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws; provided, that any report,
schedule of other document filed by the Company using the SECs EDGAR system
and publicly available on the SECs EDGAR system shall be deemed made
available to Parent.

(c) Parent and Company shall hold information received from the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.5 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 20, 2008, between Parent and
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(d) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this Section 5.5
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.



 

54 Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters._

The Company shall promptly notify Parent, and Parent shall promptly notify the
Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or
the knowledge of Parent, as the case may be, threatened against, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that,
would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue, and (iv) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement contemplated pursuant to
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

Section 5.7  _Indemnification and Insurance._

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain in effect for not less than six years after the Closing Date, the
Companys current directors and officers insurance policies (or policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the current and all former directors and officers of the
Company) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to maintain or obtain policies providing such coverage except to
the extent such coverage can be provided at an annual cost of no greater than
150% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof (the " _Cap_ "); and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if equivalent
coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual
premium in excess of the Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall only be required
to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium
equal to the Cap. In lieu of the foregoing (but subject to the Cap), and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company may obtain a prepaid
tail policy prior to the Acceptance Time, which policy provides Indemnified
Parties with directors and officers liability insurance for a period ending
no earlier than the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.

(b) Following the Effective, Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation for not less than six years after the Closing Date to keep in
effect in the Company Charter Documents all provisions at least as favorable
as the provisions in the Company Charter Documents on the date hereof that
provide for exculpation of director or officer liability and indemnification
(and advancement of expenses related thereto) of the past and present
officers, directors, employees, fiduciaries and agents (" _Indemnified
Parties_ ") of the Company, except as limited by applicable Law, and such
provisions shall not be amended during such six year period except as either
required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by applicable Law
that would enhance the rights of past or present officers and directors to
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses.



 

55 (c) The Persons to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.7. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are
intended to be for the benefit of each such Person and his or her heirs,
successors and representatives and in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 5.7 to the contrary, this Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.8  _Securityholder Litigation._

The Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the Transactions, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to
such stockholder litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such
comments into account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent.

 Section 5.9 _Fees and Expenses._

Except as provided in Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

Section 5.10 _Certain Employee-Related Matters._

(a) Except to the extent excluded from coverage under a comparable Company
Plan maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a " _Prior Company Plan_ "), for purposes of determining
whether a Continuing Employee has met the eligibility service requirements of
a Parent Benefit Plan and upon each applicable Continuing Employees
commencement of participation in an applicable Parent Benefit Plan, for
purposes of vesting and, to the extent applicable, for purposes of benefit
accrual, Parent shall credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of
service (or applicable portion thereof, as the case may be) with the Company,
any ERISA Affiliates, and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any
Prior Company Plan prior to the Continuing Employees commencement of
participation in the Parent Benefit Plan, except that Continuing Employees
shall receive no such credit (i) to the extent that such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits or (ii) under any newly-established Parent
Benefit Plan for which similarly-situated employees of Parent do not
receive credited service. Parent shall cause any applicable service or
benefit plan provider providing the Parent Benefit Plans that are "group
health plans" (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), to the
extent it is lawful, to waive any pre-existing condition exclusions or
waiting periods for Continuing Employees and shall credit such Continuing
Employees (and their dependents) for any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid under the applicable Prior Company Plans in the year of initial
participation in the applicable Parent Benefit Plans that are  



 

56  group health plans (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code)
except to the extent a Continuing Employee (or dependent) was excluded
from coverage under the applicable Prior Company Plans. Any Parent Benefit
Plan that by its terms, whether specifically or by interpretation, excludes a
Continuing Employee from participation in such Parent Benefit Plan (other than
any such plans with respect to which new participation has been frozen for
Parent employees generally) shall be amended to provide that Continuing
Employees shall participate in any such plan to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent (except as may be prohibited by applicable Law),
and no Continuing Employee shall be denied credit for service performed for
the Company, any ERISA Affiliates, and any predecessor entities under Parent
Benefit Plans to the extent consistent with the other provisions of this
Section 5.10, unless it is contrary to applicable Law. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Continuing Employee_ " shall mean those individuals
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who
continue their employment with the Company, Parent or those Subsidiaries that
are ERISA Affiliates on and after the Closing Date, and the term " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ " shall mean the employee benefit plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate of either such entity, other than a
defined benefit pension benefit plan.

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Companys
Amended and Restated Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan effective as of
the Closing Date. The 2009 Sales Incentive Plans listed on Section 3.12(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be terminated by Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation prior to the end of 2009.

(c) If requested by Parent at least five business days prior to the
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the date on which the Company becomes a member of the
same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code) as Parent (the " _Plan Termination Date_ "), any Company Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company is required
to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent
prior to the Plan Termination Date written evidence of the adoption by the
Company Board of Directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such
Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be
subject to the prior review of Parent). The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent
may reasonably request. Any actions taken under this Section 5.10(c) shall be
made contingent upon the consummation of the Offer.

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not make any
matching contributions pursuant to the Company 401(k) Plan in the form of
Common Stock.

Section 5.11 _Section 16._

The Company Board of Directors shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition of the Shares
in the Offer and the deemed disposition and cancellation of the Shares and
Options in the Merger by applicable individuals.



 

57 Section 5.12 _Rule 14d-10(d)._

Prior to the Expiration Date, the Company will present to the Compensation
Committee for consideration any agreement, arrangement or
understanding proposed to be entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on or after the date hereof with any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
officers, directors or employees (or, if requested by Parent, entered into by
Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries with any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries officers, directors or employees) pursuant to which
consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee, such that if such
agreement, arrangement or understanding is approved by the Compensation
Committee it will be done in a manner to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act. If the
Compensation Committee does not approve any proposed agreement, arrangement
or understanding, the Company will not enter into such agreement, arrangement
or understanding.

 Section 5.13 _Funding Commitment._

Parent agrees that, subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, from the
Acceptance Time until the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Company
with sufficient funds (i) to permit the Company to honor its obligations
pursuant to credit facilities, capital or finance leases and Convertible Notes
to permit the Company to operate in the ordinary course of business
consistent with the operations approved by the Company Board of Directors
after the Acceptance Time, and (ii) to permit the Company to fund in cash any
matching contributions pursuant to the Company 401(k) Plan that become due
and payable prior to the Effective Time.

The directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I,
Class II and Class III, respectively. Directors shall be assigned to each
class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors. At the first annual meeting of stockholders following the adoption
and filing of this Certificate of Incorporation, the term of office of the

(a) Any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall,
unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such
vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders,
except as otherwise provided by law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of
the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of
the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred
and until such directors successor shall have been elected and qualified.

(b) If at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship,
the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the
whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the
Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of the
shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors,
summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or
newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the
directors then in offices as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by
Section 211 of the DGCL.

(c) At any time or times that the Corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of
the California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), if, after the filling of
any vacancy by the directors then in office who have been elected by
stockholders shall constitute less than a majority of the directors then in
office, then

(i) Any holder or holders of an aggregate of five percent (5%) or more of the
total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for
those directors may call a special meeting of stockholders; or

(ii) The Superior Court of the proper county shall, upon application of such
stockholder or stockholders, summarily order a special meeting
of stockholders, to be held to elect the entire board, all in accordance with
Section 305(c) of the CGCL. The term of office of any director shall terminate
upon that election of a successor.

_5.4. Limitation of Liability_

(a) The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated
to the fullest extent under applicable law. (b) This Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as
defined in Section 317 of the CGCL) for breach of duty to the Corporation and
its shareholders through bylaw provisions or through agreements with the
agents, or through shareholder resolutions, or otherwise, in excess of the
indemnification otherwise permitted by Section 317 of the CGCL, subject, at
any time or times the Corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) to the limits
on such excess indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL.

(c) Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall be prospective and
shall not affect the rights under this Article V in effect at the time of the
alleged occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or
indemnification.

ARTICLE VI AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

The Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the affirmative
vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting
power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote. The Board of Directors shall also have the
power to adopt, amend, or repeal Bylaws. The directors of the Corporation need
not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide. No action shall
be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation except at an annual or
special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the Bylaws and no
action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent. Advance notice
of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to
be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the
Corporation.

ARTICLE VII RESERVATION OF RIGHT TO AMEND CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

(a) The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this
Article VII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted
subject to this reservation.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation
or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no
vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular
class or series of the Voting Stock required by law, this Certificate of
Incorporation or any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting
power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting
together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal
Articles V, VI, and VII.
