Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any further action on
the part of Parent LP, Merger Sub, Company LP, or the holders of Company LP
Units, Parent LP Units or partnership units of Merger Sub, (i) the partnership
interests of Merger Sub held by Parent LP and issued and outstanding

the Exchange Ratio, and (iii) each vested Company Incentive Unit eligible for
conversion into a Company LP Unit shall be so converted to the fullest extent
permitted under the Company Partnership Agreement and treated in accordance
with clause (ii) hereof, and each holder of New Parent LP Units shall be
admitted as a limited partner of Parent LP in accordance with the terms of the
Parent Partnership Agreement. No fractional New Parent LP Units will be
issued in the Partnership Merger. Any fractional New Parent LP Unit that would
otherwise be issued to any holder of Company LP Units or Company Incentive
Units shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Section 3.3 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and subject to  _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Parent Merger Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the Company Common Stock, or make a distribution in Company Common
Stock, or otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any other securities
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then (without limiting any
other rights of Parent hereunder), the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any such change and any Restricted
Stock Payment and/or Phantom Share Payment to be received in the form of
Parent Common Stock (each such payment, a " _Stock Award Payment_ ") shall be

(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Parent Merger
Consideration, the LVS Merger Consideration, the Stock Award Payments and the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, as provided in  _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section
3.3_ and _Section 3.9_. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall

representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Limited Voting
Stock sufficient to pay the Parent Merger Consideration, the LVS Merger
Consideration and the Stock Award Payments, and (ii) cash in immediately
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Aggregate
Cash Consideration (such certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock and Parent Limited Voting Stock and cash amounts, the " _Aggregate
Parent Merger Consideration_ " and such Aggregate Parent Merger Consideration
as deposited with the Exchange Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Limited Voting Stock, Company Restricted Stock and Company Phantom Shares. In
the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 3.5_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make,
payments of the Parent Merger Consideration, the LVS Merger Consideration and
the Stock Award Payments and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.4(d)_ or otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 3.9_ out of the Exchange

Surviving Entity of the Parent Merger.

 

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Parent Merger Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be

Company Limited Voting Stock. From and after the Parent Merger Effective Time,
persons who held shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Parent Merger Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise

 



22  provided for herein. On or after the Parent Merger Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Entity of the
Parent Merger for any reason shall be exchanged for the Parent Merger
Consideration or LVS Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Limited Voting Stock, respectively, formerly
represented thereby.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Parent Merger Effective Time (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Entity of the Parent Merger shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to
make available for collection by hand) (A) to each holder of record of a
Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock, (x) a letter of transmittal (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as the Surviving Entity of the Parent Merger
may reasonably specify, and (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Parent Merger Consideration
into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement,
together with any amounts payable in respect of dividends or distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.4(d)_ (which
instructions shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder,
(i) Certificates may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (ii) the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, together with any amounts payable
in respect of dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with  _Section 3.4(d)_, may be collected by hand by the
surrendering holder or by check or wire transfer to the surrendering holder),

Agreement, (C) to each holder of a Company Option, a certificate representing
an option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock, (D) to each holder of a
share of Company Restricted Stock, a certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section
3.5(b)_ in respect of such share of Company Restricted Stock, and (E) to each
holder of a Company Phantom Share, a certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section
3.5(c)_, if any, in respect of such Company Phantom Share.

 



23 (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Parent Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_ plus any cash such holder is entitled to
receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.9_ and any
amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.4(d)_, to be mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered by
wire transfer, within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur of
(A) the Parent Merger Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agents receipt of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith
canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.4_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any
time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Parent Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Article III_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates.

 

(iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall
cause the Exchange Agent (A) to issue to each holder of Book-Entry Shares that
number of uncertificated whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Limited
Voting Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_ in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, and (B) to issue and deliver to
each holder of Book-Entry Shares a check or wire transfer for any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 3.4(d)_ and any other amount such holder is
entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
3.9_, in each case, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and
such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry Shares on the Parent Merger
Consideration or LVS Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Book-Entry
Shares.

 



24 (iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Limited Voting Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that any
Certificate surrendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 3.4(c)_ shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and
that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer Taxes and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(d) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Following surrender
of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be
paid to the holder thereof in addition to the other amounts payable hereunder

other distributions with a record date after the Parent Merger Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Parent Merger Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore received any Parent Merger Consideration
to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with respect
thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity of the
Parent Merger, or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director,
agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of any part of the Parent
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any

 



25  Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity of the Parent Merger, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Parent
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity of the Parent Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_ and, to the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
payments of the Aggregate Parent Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments, (ii)
no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments
to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in
short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments,
shall be property of, and paid to, the Surviving Entity of the Parent Merger.

 

Section 3.5 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Phantom Shares_. All of the
provisions of this _Section 3.5_ shall be effectuated without any action on
the part of the holder of any Company Option, Company Restricted Stock and/or
Company Phantom Shares.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Parent Merger Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Parent Merger Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall
be assumed by Parent and will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule), as were
applicable immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time as set forth
in the applicable Company Plan (including pursuant to any applicable award
agreement, other agreement or other document evidencing such Company
Option) immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time (and any
Company Options that become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with
their terms upon consummation of the Parent Merger shall be fully vested and
exercisable), except that, from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time,
(i) each such Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) determined by dividing (x) the exercise price of each
share of Company Common Stock at which the assumed Company Options
were exercisable immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time by (y)
the Exchange Ratio.

 



26 (b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. At the Parent Merger
Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be converted into
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Parent Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 3.1(b)_ of this Agreement (the "
_Restricted Stock Payment_ "), which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture
conditions) as are applicable to such shares of Company Restricted Stock
immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time (and any shares of
Company Restricted Stock that become fully vested in accordance with their
terms upon consummation of the Parent Merger shall be fully vested). As of
the Parent Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Restricted Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Restricted Stock Payment.

 

(c) _Treatment of Company Phantom Shares_. At the Parent Merger Effective
Time, each Company Phantom Share outstanding immediately prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time shall be converted into a number of fully vested shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the Parent Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 3.1(b)_ of this Agreement (the " _Phantom Share Payment_ ").
Any dividend equivalents associated with a holders Company Phantom Shares
shall be settled by issuing to such holder, at Parents election, either (i) a
cash payment or (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case,
with a value equal to the value of such dividend equivalents, with the value
of the Parent Common Stock to be the VWAP of Parent Common Stock. Such cash
shall be paid, or shares shall be issued, as applicable, at the same time as
the Phantom Share Payment and shall be considered part of the Phantom Share
Payment for purposes of this Agreement. As of the Parent Merger Effective
Time, each holder of Company Phantom Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Phantom Share Payment.

(d) _Company Assumed Awards_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Parent Merger Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days following the Parent Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each
holder of a Company Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to such Company Option. Unless the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of the Company Option are otherwise
covered by an existing registration statement on Form S-8 immediately upon the
Parent Merger Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC such
a registration statement with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the Parent Merger Effective Time
and Parent shall exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Company
Options remain outstanding (subject to blackout periods and similar
restrictions in accordance with Parents policies). The Company and its
counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation
of any such registration statement.

 

(e) _Manner of Effecting_. Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, the
Company and Parent agree that the Company shall, and shall be permitted under
this Agreement to, take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this

 



27   _Section 3.5_. From and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, unless the
compensation committee of the Parent Board determines otherwise, all
references to the Company in the Company equity incentive plans and in each
award or other agreement evidencing or relating to any Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock or Company Phantom Shares or any other Company
equity-based award, shall be deemed (i) for all purposes relating to
employment, consultancy or directorship (or words of similar meaning) to refer
to Parent and its Subsidiaries and (ii) for all other purposes, to refer to
Parent.

 

Section 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Parent LP, Merger Sub (and any
Affiliate of the foregoing), the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Parent Merger
Consideration, the LVS Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement (including consideration described in  _Section
3.2(b)_ and amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.9_) to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Limited Voting Stock, shares
of Company Restricted Stock and Company Phantom Shares (or otherwise pursuant
to this Agreement), such amounts as any such Person is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority pursuant to this _Section 3.6_, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

Section 3.7 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity of the Parent Merger, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity of
the Parent Merger may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent Merger
Consideration or LVS Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.8 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Parent Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, so long as the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL are applicable to the transaction.

 

Section 3.9 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Limited Voting Stock shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to
Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Parent Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock, shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, no
consideration shall be payable for any fractional shares of Company Limited
Voting Stock.

occupancy, necessary for the Company, Company LP and each Company Subsidiary
to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its properties or to
carry on its respective business substantially as it is being conducted as of

valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in
possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any

respect to such Company Permits have been duly made on a timely basis with the
appropriate Governmental Authority, except in each case for failures to file

currently not in compliance with the terms of any such Company Permits, except
where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any such Company

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Company Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis)
to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2010 

 



35  (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each Company SEC Filing, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii)
did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is separately subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules (the " _Company
Financial Statements_ "), was prepared (except as indicated in the notes
thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated, and each such consolidated financial statement presented
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results
of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the provisions of the Exchange Act and
Securities Act relating thereto which under the terms of such provisions
(including the dates by which such compliance is required) have become
applicable to the Company. Each of the principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Filings.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The records, systems, controls, data and information
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of
internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded,
stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive
ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect
on the system of internal accounting controls. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (i) transactions
are executed only in accordance with managements authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit

 



36  preparation of the financial statements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (iii) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (iv) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. The Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls, and
the Company has made available to Parent copies of any material written
materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is recorded,
processed, summarized and made known to the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.
The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and accurate
copies of notices received by the Company from its independent auditor of any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting since January 1, 2010 and any other
management letter or similar correspondence received by the Company since
January 1, 2010 from any independent auditor of the Company or any of the
then-existing Subsidiaries of the Company. Since the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has made any
prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of the Company (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 

(d) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or

the other Parent Subsidiaries.

dividends or distributions on any securities of any Parent Subsidiary which

any Governmental Authority and accreditation and certification agencies,

or to carry on its respective business substantially as it is being conducted

62 Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to
be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2010 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each
Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in
the case of registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of
the date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any other
Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

(b) Each of Parents consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented
or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities
Act relating thereto which under the terms of such provisions (including the
dates by which such compliance is required) have become applicable to Parent.
Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal financial
officer of Parent has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or
15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with
respect to the Parent SEC Filings. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The records,
systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
that are used in the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or the
Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. Parent and the

 



63  Parent Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (i)
transactions are executed only in accordance with managements authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
financial statements of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain
accountability for the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; (iii)
access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
authorization; (iv) the reporting of such assets is compared with existing
assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and other receivables and
inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Board
of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls, and
Parent has made available to the Company copies of any material written
materials relating to the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent required to be included in reports filed under
the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is recorded,
processed, summarized and made known to Parents principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer by others within those entities, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in Parents
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company complete and accurate copies of notices received by
Parent from its independent auditor of any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in Parents internal control over financial reporting
since January 1, 2010 and any other management letter or similar
correspondence received by Parent since January 1, 2010 from any independent
auditor of Parent or any of the then-existing Parent Subsidiaries. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of Parent, Parent LP, Merger Sub or
any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or
executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the
Exchange Act).

 

(d) None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except
for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly contemplated by or under this
Agreement, including _Section 6.2_ hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the most recent
balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made

 



64  through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any
section of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject
of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings which remains unresolved, nor
has it received any inquiry or information request from the SEC as to any
matters affecting Parent which has not been adequately addressed. Parent has
made available to the Company true and complete copies of all written comment
letters from the staff of the SEC received since January 1, 2010 through the
date of this Agreement relating to the Parent SEC Filings and all written
responses of Parent thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the
Parent SEC Filings is the subject of any confidential treatment request by
Parent.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent, Parent LP, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time such document
is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or
at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC, contain any

misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first

Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting, at the time
the Form S-4, is declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent
relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion therein, will
comply as to form, in all material respects, with the provisions of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the information
required to be contained therein.

 

(b) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 5.8_ shall
not apply to statements or omissions included in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement to the extent based upon information supplied to Parent by or
on behalf of the Company.

with third parties and keep available the services of its present officers and
key employees.

 



83 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent covenants and agrees that, during
the Interim Period, except to the extent required by Law, as may be agreed in
writing by the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

arrangement to do any of the foregoing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,

Parent to avoid or to continue to avoid incurring entity-level income or
excise Taxes under the Code maintain its qualification as a REIT under the
Code for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, including making dividend or distribution payments
to stockholders of Parent in accordance with this Agreement or otherwise, or

which will include the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4

85  as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the Form S-4,
effective for so long as necessary to complete the Parent Merger. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the other and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement. The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other party to be included therein.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, and shall
provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the

any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the
other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response

sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated. Parent shall also take any other action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required
to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign
or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
Parent Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, in the case of
the Form S-4, or receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent
Stockholder Approval, in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement
to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the

 



86  Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the
Company and Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 6.3(a)_. For purposes of _Section
4.8_, _Section 5.8_ and this _Section 6.3_, any information concerning or
related to the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will
be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning
or related to Parent or its Affiliates or the Parent Stockholder Meeting
will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the stockholders of the Company and to hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall, through the
Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement

Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section
6.5(d)_.

stockholders that they give the Parent Stockholder Approval, include such

as permitted by _Section 6.5(e)_.

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to, afford to
the other party and to the Representatives of such other party reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all
of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,

filed

 



87  by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial or otherwise)

reasonably request. Subject to the terms of the Company Leases, Parent, at its
own expense, shall have the right to such reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice in order to prepare or
cause to be prepared surveys, inspections, engineering studies, environmental
assessments and other tests, examination or studies with respect to any
Specified Property that Parent deems to be reasonably necessary, so long as
such access does not unduly interfere with the Companys ordinary conduct of
business; provided, that (x) neither Parent nor any of its Representatives
shall be entitled to conduct intrusive soil testing or similar assessments at
any Company Property without the Companys prior written consent and (y)
Parent shall indemnify the Company for any losses, costs or damages caused by
such access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required by this  _Section 6.4_ to provide the other party or the
Representatives of such other party with access to or to disclose information
(x) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would violate
any Law or fiduciary duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or
fiduciary duty) or (z) that is subject to any attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege).

 

(b) The Company shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by
Parent from time to time and to the extent consistent with applicable Law, in
Parents efforts to oversee the integration of the parties operations in
connection with, and taking effect upon consummation of, the Mergers,
including providing such reports on operational matters and participating on
such teams and committees as Parent may reasonably request (including tenant
billing and other data files for the purpose of system integration and testing
as well as compensation and payroll data files for the purpose of
payroll system integration and testing with respect to employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), and including providing reasonable
notice to, and consulting with, Parent in connection with the Companys review
and approval of any budgets or operating plans pursuant to any JV Agreements.

88 (d) Each of the Company and Parent agree to give prompt written notice to
the other upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of
any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which (i) could reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, (ii) if unremedied by
the Effective Time, would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, or covenants contained herein, and to use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent or promptly to remedy the same or (iii) is
an action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened which questions
or challenges the validity of this Agreement or that could otherwise adversely
impact the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Mergers; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations and
warranties of any party or relieve any party of any breach of any such
representation or warranty or affect the remedies available to the party
receiving notice hereunder.

not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any other
Representatives of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries not to, directly
or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal
(provided that for purposes of this _Section 6.5(a)_, the references in the
definition of Company Acquisition Proposal to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be
deemed to be five percent (5%)) (an " _Inquiry_ "), (ii) engage in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any
non-public information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or knowingly facilitate in any way any effort by, any Third Party in
connection with, any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (iii) approve
or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section 6.5(b)_) providing for or relating
to a Company Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
"), or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_, at any
time prior to obtaining the requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company may, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party received after the date of this
Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this  _Section 6.5_) (i)
furnish non-public information to such Third Party (and such Third Partys
Representatives) making a Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company
receives from the Third

 



89  Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-
public information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
provided to such Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to
Parent, be provided to Parent prior to or simultaneously with providing it to
such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) with respect to the
Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii):
(x) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such Company
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of  _Section 6.5_.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than one
(1) Business Day) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary by any Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking to have
discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Company
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Third Party making the Company
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any
Inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any
related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly, and
in any event within one (1) Business Day, notify Parent, orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Company
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this _Section 6.5(c)_ and keep the other party informed of
the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or correspondence relating thereto.

 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to Parent, Parent LP or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (ii)
approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or any Schedule 14D-9, as

described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 6.5(d)_, a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt,
declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to enter
into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section
6.5_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and

 



90  subject to compliance with _Section 6.5(f)_, _Section 6.5(g)_, if
applicable, and _Section 8.3_, the Company Board shall be permitted to (x)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement, including an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, with respect to a Superior Proposal if the
Company Board (A) has received a Company Acquisition Proposal that, in the
good faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect to
all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to, _Section
6.5(f)_, and (B) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, or (y) effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, after the date of this Agreement:
(I) the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.5_ and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law,
or (II) in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal, a Company Intervening Event has occurred or arisen and the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law.

(e) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(e)_, neither the Parent Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to the Company or the Company LP, the Parent Recommendation, or (ii)
fail to include the Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or any
Schedule 14D-9, as applicable (any of the actions described in clauses (i) or
(ii), a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval, and subject to compliance with _Section
6.5(g)_ and  _Section 8.3_, the Parent Board shall be permitted to effect a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if, after the date of this Agreement a
Parent Intervening Event has occurred or arisen and the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) The Company Board shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement or
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section
6.5(d)_ in circumstances involving or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action
and describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete
copy of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action and, to the
extent not prohibited by confidentiality restrictions, identifying the third
party making such Superior Proposal, (ii) during the five

 



91  (5) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii)
following the end of the five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment
to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, and the Company
shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section
6.5(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the five (5) Business Day
period above shall then be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period.

(g) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section 6.5(d)_ in circumstances
not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and the Parent
Board shall not be entitled to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
as permitted under _Section 6.5(e)_, unless (i) the party proposing to take
action has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ")
to the other party that the notifying party intends to take such action and
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, (ii) during the five (5)
Business Day period following the other partys receipt of the Notice of
Recommendation Change, the notifying party shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, engage in discussions with the receiving party in good
faith (to the extent the receiving party desires to engage in such
discussions) regarding such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as may be proposed by the receiving party, and (iii) following the
end of the five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board, to the extent the
Company is the notifying party, or the Parent Board, to the extent Parent is
the notifying party, as the case may be, shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, taking into account
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by the receiving party
in response to the Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board through its Representatives,
directly or indirectly, from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look
and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way
limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has
under any other provision of this Agreement, and _provided_ , _further_ , that
any such disclosure that addresses the approval, recommendation
or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this
Agreement or a Company

 



92  Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless the Company Board in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of such party, without disclosing any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause any other Representatives of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries to immediately cease any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause all Third Parties who have been furnished
confidential information regarding the Company in connection with the
solicitation of or discussions regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal
within the six (6) months prior to the date of this Agreement to promptly
return or destroy such information (to the extent that the Company is entitled
to have such information returned or destroyed). Moreover, except as set
forth in _Section 6.5(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company will
not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal.

(j) Without the prior written consent of each of the Company and Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby is the only matter that either the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall propose to be acted on by its respective stockholders at
the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, other than (i) any say-on-golden parachute vote that may be
required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c)
thereunder, (ii) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, if
necessary to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, to obtain the approval of the Companys
stockholders or Parents stockholders, as applicable, (iii) with respect to
Parent, any proposal or proposals to approve an amendment to the Parent
Charter increasing Parents authorized shares of capital stock to an amount
not to exceed 100,000,000 shares, and (iv) with respect to the Company, the
proposals related to the Company Equity Plan Share Increase Approval.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer for
(or expression by a Third Party that it is considering or may engage in),
whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii)
any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license,

 



93  transfer or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger,
consolidation, sale of equity interests, share exchange, joint venture,
business combination or otherwise, of any assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole as determined on a book-value basis, (iii) any issue, sale or
other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, joint
venture, business combination, share exchange or any similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more
of the voting power of the Company, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer in
which any Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial ownership (as such
term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the
right to acquire beneficial ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company, (v) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to the Company in which a Third Party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company or (vi)
any transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term " _Company
Acquisition Proposal_ " shall not include (x) the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) any proposal or offer
relating to any existing purchase option, right of first offer, right of
first refusal or buy/sell provision contained in any agreement to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or (z) any transaction
contemplated by the RL Option Agreement or the CalSTRS Option Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " to "twenty
percent (20%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third
Party on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial and legal advisors, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such proposal, including the identity of the Person
making such proposal, as well as any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in response to such proposal or
otherwise, to be more favorable to the Company and the Companys stockholders
(solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



94 Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.5_), each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to)
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
or pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions
necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities,
if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or
reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust,
merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible,  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of Parent, Parent LP or any Parent Subsidiary nor the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any action that would be
materially adverse to the business or financial condition of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing
the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement. To the extent practicable, and permitted by a Governmental
Authority, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the other party
to participate in meetings (whether by telephone or in person) with such
Governmental Authority.

 



95 (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything in the Company Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries or the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices
to Third Parties, and Parent shall use, and cause each of its Affiliates to
use, its reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its efforts, to obtain any third-
party consents not covered by _Section 6.6(a)_ and _Section 6.6(b)_ that
are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any third party pursuant
to this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall not be considered a condition to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers.

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by
it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving such party or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which relate to this Agreement, the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless such settlement involves no admission of liability and no
restrictions or other obligations binding on Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries other than the payment of money and the amount
of such settlement shall be fully covered by insurance proceeds. Parent shall
give the Company the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against Parent and/or its directors
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the Companys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such settlement involves no admission of liability and no restrictions
or other obligations binding on Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries other than the payment of money and the amount of such
settlement shall be fully covered by insurance proceeds.

 



96 Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such
press release or make any such public filing prior to obtaining the other
parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without
obtaining the other parties consent, issue such press release or make such
public statement or filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing
agreement of any party hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to
consult with the other party before making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the
party making such statement shall not make a statement that is inconsistent
with public statements or filings to which the other party had previously
consented.

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Parent Merger Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of
Indemnitees as provided in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or each
of the Company Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
or in any indemnification agreement of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement and
listed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall survive the Mergers and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent and
the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to)
(i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees
with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any time prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, to the fullest extent
required by: (x) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or the articles or
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (y) any indemnification agreement of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect
on the date of this Agreement and listed in the Company Disclosure Letter, or
(z) applicable Law, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (i)(y) above in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



97 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Parent Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Parent Merger Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (x) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a
director, officer, partner, member, trustee or employee of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement and any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor
the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity not
to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.9(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include
an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving
Entity (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
prior written consent and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee shall promptly
refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such expenses
theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 

(c) Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the
Parent Merger Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "
_D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Parent Merger Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies and with policy limits no less than the limits on the Companys
existing policies as long as the annual premium does not exceed 300% of the
annual premium under the Companys existing policies. If the Company or 

 



98  the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Parent Merger Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity
shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to
provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Parent Merger
Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the
Company (which may be provided under Parents DandO Insurance policy) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this  _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this  _Section
6.9_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee or any employee with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries listed in  _Section 4.12(a)(iv)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (each, an " _Existing Indemnification Right_ "). To the
extent of any conflict between an Existing Indemnification Right and the
rights granted to Indemnitees pursuant to this _Section 6.9_, the provision
or provisions more favorable to the Indemnitee shall control.

(f) Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
6.9_, upon learning of any such indemnifiable claim, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Entity thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
Parent or the Surviving Entity of any liability it may have to such
Indemnitee, except to the extent such

 



99  failure materially prejudices the Surviving Entity. In the event of any such
threatened or actual indemnifiable claim (whether asserted or arising at or
before or after the Parent Merger Effective Time), (A) Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee (which acceptance shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall not be liable to such Indemnitee for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Entity elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnitee
advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between Parent
or the Surviving Entity and the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may retain
counsel satisfactory to him or her, and Parent or the Surviving Entity shall
pay all documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnitee within
twenty (20) Business Days after statements therefor are received; _provided_
,  _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (f) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnitees in connection with an indemnifiable claim (selected by a majority
of the applicable Indemnitees) in any jurisdiction except to the extent that
any two or more Indemnitees have a conflict of interest in such claim, and (B)
the Company and, after the Parent Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to) promptly pay expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim to
each Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to
the receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnitee to repay such expenses if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Surviving Entity shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which prior written consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
and the Surviving Entity shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that
indemnification by them of such Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.9_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees
the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to
this _Section 6.9_.

 



100 Section 6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, to
employees of the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries (" _Company
Employees_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment
with the Surviving Entity, Company Subsidiaries and its Affiliates is
involuntarily terminated in a severance-qualifying manner during the one
(1)-year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance benefits, if any, that
would have been provided to such Company Employee pursuant to the terms of
the severance pay arrangements maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries upon such an involuntary severance-qualifying termination of
employment immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting accrual and determination of level
of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Parent Subsidiaries, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and any of its subsidiaries or any
respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Closing, and in which such Company Employees did not
participate prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), including for
purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits
under New Plans (but excluding any New Plan that is established after the
Closing that does not recognize service prior to its adoption), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional
service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent
as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan, except where such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before such replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions and actively-at-work requirements would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Company employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of any Company Benefit
Plan listed in _Section 6.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Closing
shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control."

 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Entity to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor
or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section
6.10_, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
Company Benefit Plan, any New Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan
or arrangement for any purpose.

 



101 Section 6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of Parent or the Company shall
take any action, or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected
to cause the Parent Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain or cause to be provided, as
appropriate the opinions of counsel described in  _Section 7.2(e)_ and
_Section 7.3(f)_, respectively. Provided that the Company shall have received
the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 7.3(f)_ and Parent shall have
received the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 7.2(e)_, the Parties
shall treat the Parent Merger as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code and no party shall take any position for tax purposes inconsistent

of such termination, or (B) by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)(x)_,
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent Parents Expense Amount
(by wire transfer to an account designated by Parent) within two (2) Business
Days of such termination; or

 

(vi) (A) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to (x) _Section 8.1(b)(i)_
or (y) _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, as a result of the failure to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, and (B) the Company (x) receives or has received
a Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement,
which proposal has been publicly announced and has not been withdrawn either
(I) at or prior to the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting (with respect
to a termination under _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_) or (II) otherwise prior to
the termination of this Agreement (including if there has been no Company
Stockholder Meeting), and (y) within twelve (12) months after the termination
of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a
definitive 

 



113  agreement which is later consummated with respect to, any Company
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Termination Fee plus, if not previously paid pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)(i)_, Parents Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent, not later than the second Business Day following
the date of the consummation of such transaction arising from any such
Company Acquisition Proposal; or

(vii) (A) by Parent pursuant to (x) _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or (y) _Section
8.1(d)(ii)(x)_, and (B) the Company (x) receives or has received a Company
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, which proposal has been
publicly announced and has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of
this Agreement (and/or, solely in the case of a termination by Parent under
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_, that was otherwise communicated to the Board during such
period whether or not publicly disclosed), and (y) within twelve (12) months
after the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding,
or executes a definitive agreement which is later consummated with respect to,
any Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent, not later than the second Business Day following
the date of the consummation of such transaction arising from such Company
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that Parents Expense Amount shall
have already been paid by Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_
or _Section 8.3(a)(v)_, as applicable).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of
appropriate wire transfer instructions from the party entitled to payment; and

(ii) under no circumstances shall either the Company or Parent be required to
pay either the Termination Fee or the other partys Expense Amount on more
than one occasion.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement;

 



114  accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely
pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain
such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any
amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such paying party shall pay the other
party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the annual rate of ten percent (10%) for the period
from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such
payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

(d) If the Company is required to pay Parent a Termination Payment, such
Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is
required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance
with this  _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that the Company is obligated to
pay Parent a Termination Payment, the amount payable to Parent in any tax year
of Parent shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment, and (ii)
the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing
such party to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3)
of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), and Parent has income from unknown
sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is
not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which
is not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by Parents independent
accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent receives either (x) a letter from
Parents counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS as
described in _Section 8.3(e)_ or (y) an opinion from its outside counsel as
described in _Section 8.3(e)_, an amount equal to the excess of the
Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause (A) above.

(e) To secure the Companys obligation to pay any amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(d)_, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to the Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Company
on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3_) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall be
made at the time the Company is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant
to _Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that
the Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released
to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing
such party to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income and Parent has income from unknown sources during such year
in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
receiving party, or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that (A)
Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by such party
of

 



115  the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code or (B) Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by such party of the Termination Payment should
either constitute Qualifying Income should be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case
the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment to
Parent. The Company agrees to amend this _Section 8.3_ at the reasonable
request of Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii)
improve Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
_Section 8.3_ or (iii) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 8.3_. Any amount of
the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year
shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject
to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3_, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the obligation of the Company to pay the unpaid portion of the
Termination Payment shall terminate on the December 31 following the date
which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement. Any payment due to
Parent described in _(c)_ shall be subject to the same limitations on
payment as set forth in this _Section 8.3(e)_.

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not
be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders
of the Company or Parent without such further approval of such stockholders,
or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each
of the parties hereto. 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

 



116 Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of
the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint
Proxy Statement, other than attorneys and accountants fees.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article
or Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the

 



118  words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the
case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a
person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to
"dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America.

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole
or in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto
(except to the Surviving Entities).

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
schedules, annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 6.9_. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with

 



119   _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other person. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons
other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 9.9  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent, Parent LP, Merger Sub or the Company or Company LP in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware, except with respect to matters under the MGCL and the MRULPA
relating to the Mergers, which shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

 

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, for the

tort or otherwise) directly or 

 



120  indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect to such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined exclusively in any state or federal court located in the State of

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party and nothing in this _Section 9.11_ shall affect the right of any party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any United States federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any

personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than any United States federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court. Each of Parent, Parent LP, Merger Sub, the Company
and Company LP agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO

_[Signature Page to Merger Agreement]_ Exhibit A

 

Form of Company Stockholders Voting Agreement

 



Exhibit A - 1 VOTING AGREEMENT

 

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
September 4, 2013, by and among Parkway Properties, Inc. (" _Parent_ "),
Parkway Properties LP (" _Parent LP_ ", and, together with Parent, the "
_Parent Parties_ ") and each of the undersigned stockholders (each a "
_Stockholder_ " and, collectively, the " _Stockholders_ ") of Thomas
Properties Group, Inc. (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

 

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Parent Parties, the
Company, Thomas Properties Group, L.P. (" _Company LP_ ") and PKY Masters, LP
(" _Merger Sub_ ") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") which, among other things, provides for (i) the merger
of the Company with and into Parent with Parent being the surviving entity
(the " _Parent Merger_ ") immediately after (ii) the merger of Merger Sub with
and into Company LP, with Company LP continuing as the surviving entity and a
subsidiary of Parent LP (the " _Partnership Merger_ ", and together with the
Parent Merger, the " _Mergers_ ").

B. As a condition and an inducement to the Parent Parties willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement, the Parent Parties have required that each
Stockholder agrees, and each Stockholder has agreed to, enter into this
Agreement with respect to (i) all common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") , (ii) all limited voting stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Limited Voting
Stock_ ") and (iii) all limited partnership interests in Company LP
designated as a "Partnership Unit" (the " _Company Partnership Units_ ") under
the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Company LP, dated as of October 13,
2004, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the " _Company
LP Agreement_ "), in each case that such Stockholder owns, if any,
beneficially (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or of record.

 

C. Each Stockholder is the beneficial or record owner, and has either sole or
shared voting power over, such number of shares of the Company Common Stock
and the Company Limited Voting Stock (the " _Company Stock_ ") and the Company
Partnership Units (the " _Company Units_ "), if any, as is indicated opposite
such Stockholders name on _Schedule A_  attached hereto.

D. Parent desires that each Stockholder agree, and each Stockholder is willing
to agree, subject to the limitations herein, not to Transfer (as defined
below) any of its Subject Securities (as defined below), and to vote its
Subject Securities in a manner so as to facilitate consummation of the
Mergers.

 



Exhibit A - 2 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Definitions._ Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement. When used in this Agreement, the following terms in all of their
tenses, cases and correlative forms shall have the meanings assigned to them
in this Section 1 or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

" _Expiration Time_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (i) the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii)
such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Article VIII thereof or (iii) the termination of this Agreement by mutual
written consent of the parties hereto. 

" _Permitted Transfer_ " shall mean, in each case, with respect to any
Stockholder, so long as (i) such Transfer is in accordance with applicable
Law and (ii) such Stockholder is and at all times has been in compliance with
this Agreement, any Transfer of Subject Securities by such Stockholder (x) to
an Affiliate of such Stockholder or (y) in the case of a Stockholder that is
a natural person, to any member of such Stockholders immediate family, or to
a trust for the benefit of such Stockholder or any member of such
Stockholders immediate family, so long as such Affiliate or other permitted
transferee (if applicable), in connection with such Transfer, executes a
joinder to this Agreement pursuant to which such Affiliate or other permitted
transferee (if applicable) agrees to become a party to this Agreement and be
subject to the restrictions applicable to such Stockholder and otherwise
become a party for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such
Transfer shall relieve the transferring Stockholder from his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement, other than with respect to the Company
Stock or the Company Units transferred in accordance with the foregoing
provision.

 

" _Subject Securities_ " shall mean, collectively, the Company Stock, the New
Company Stock, the Company Units, and the New Company Units.

" _Transfer_ " shall mean (i) any direct or indirect offer, sale,
assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other

or entry into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with
respect to any offer, sale, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation,
disposition, loan or other transfer (by operation of Law or otherwise), of any
Subject Securities (or any security convertible or exchangeable into Subject
Securities) or interest in any Subject Securities, including, without
limitation, a redemption of the Company Partnership Units for cash pursuant to
the terms of the Company LP Agreement, but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, entry into this Agreement, or (ii) entering into any swap or any other
agreement, transaction or series of transactions that hedges or transfers, in
whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of
ownership of such capital stock or interest in capital stock, whether any
such swap, agreement, transaction or series of transactions is to be settled
by delivery of securities, in cash or otherwise. For purposes of this
Agreement, "capital stock" shall include interests in a limited partnership.

 



Exhibit A - 3 2\. _Agreement to Retain the Company Stock and the Company Units_.

 

2.1 _Transfer and Encumbrance of Subject Securities_. Other than a Permitted
Transfer, hereafter until the Expiration Time, each Stockholder agrees, with
respect to any Subject Securities beneficially owned by such Stockholder, not
to (i) Transfer any such Subject Securities, or (ii) deposit any such Subject
Securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
arrangement with respect to such Subject Securities or grant any proxy (except
as otherwise provided herein) or power of attorney with respect thereto.

 

2.2 _Additional Purchases_. Each Stockholder agrees that any Company Common
Stock, Company Limited Voting Stock and other capital shares of the Company
that such Stockholder purchases or otherwise acquires or with respect to which
such Stockholder otherwise acquires sole or shared voting power after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Time (the "
_New Company Stock_ ") and any Company Partnership Units or other partnership
interests of Company LP that such Stockholder purchases or otherwise acquires
or with respect to which such Stockholder otherwise acquires sole or shared
voting power after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Expiration Time (the " _New Company Units_ ") shall, in each case, be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
constituted the Company Stock or the Company Units, as applicable.

2.3 _Unpermitted Transfers_. Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Subject
Securities in violation of this Section 2 shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, be null and void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any of
the Company Stock or the Company Units held by a Stockholder subject to any
Lien (as set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto) become subject to foreclosure,
forfeiture or other similar proceedings, thereby causing such Stockholder to
be unable to comply with his, her or its obligations under this Agreement
with respect to such securities, such Stockholder shall not be deemed to be in
breach of this Agreement with respect to such Stockholders obligations with
respect to such Company Stock or Company Units. 

3\. _Agreement to Vote and Approve_.

 

3.1 _Company Stock_.

(a) Hereafter until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the stockholders
of the Company called with respect to any of the following matters, and at
every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the stockholders of the Company with respect to any of the
following matters, each Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record
on any applicable record date to (including via proxy), vote 80% of the
Company Stock and any New Company Stock owned by such Stockholder: (i) in
favor of the Parent Merger, and (ii) against (a) any Acquisition Proposal for
the Company, (b) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to
result in any condition to the consummation of the Mergers set forth in
Article VII of the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled, and (c) any action
which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, materially
delay, materially postpone or materially adversely affect consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



Exhibit A - 4 (b) Hereafter until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the stockholders
of the Company called with respect to any of the following matters, and at
every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the stockholders of the Company with respect to any of the
following matters, each Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of
record on any applicable record date to (including via proxy), vote 20% of the
Company Stock and any New Company Stock owned by such Stockholder (as to each
such Stockholder, its " _Neutral Voting Shares_ "): (i) in favor of the
Parent Merger, and (ii) against (a) any Acquisition Proposal for the Company,
(b) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the consummation of the Mergers set forth in Article VII of the
Merger Agreement not being fulfilled, and (c) any action which could
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, materially delay, materially
postpone or materially adversely affect consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in direct proportion to the votes cast
by the other holders of Company Stock (other than any other Stockholders)
entitled to vote thereon (including, for this purpose, any abstentions and
"withhold" votes, but disregarding any broker non-votes and other shares not
present). For example, if votes are submitted with respect to 80% of the
voting power of the shares of Common Stock held by other stockholders, and
70% of those 80% are voted in favor of the matter, 20% of the 80% are voted
against the matter and 10% of the 80% abstain, then the Stockholders would
vote 70% of their Neutral Voting Shares in favor of the matter, 20% of their
Neutral Voting Shares against the matter, and abstain with respect to 10% of
their Neutral Voting Shares. From time to time before the scheduled date for
any such meeting at the request of the Stockholders, the Company shall inform
the Stockholders of the voting tabulations (including, for this purpose, all
votes "for" or "against" and all "abstentions" and "withhold" votes) for such
meeting (it being understood and agreed by the parties that the Company shall
request the proxy solicitation firm engaged by it, if any, in connection with
such meeting to provide such tabulations directly to the Stockholders from
time to time as such tabulations are provided to the Company) for the purpose
of facilitating the obligations and agreements to vote the Company Stock and
New Company Stock owned by the Stockholders in accordance with the
requirements of this Section 3.1(b); provided, however, that the failure of
the Company to obtain, or the Stockholders to receive, voting tabulations on
a daily basis pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) shall not relieve any
Stockholder of his, her or its obligation to vote any such Neutral Voting
Shares as provided in this Section 3.1(b).

 

3.2 _Company Units_. Hereafter until the Expiration Time, on every action or
approval by written consent of the partners of Company LP with respect to any
of the following matters, whether contemplated now or at any time prior to the
Expiration Time, and at every meeting of the partners of Company LP called
with respect to any of the following matters, and at every adjournment
or postponement thereof, each Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of
record on any applicable record date to (including via proxy), vote the
Company Units and any New Company Units: (i) in favor of the Partnership
Merger; (ii) in favor of any amendment to the Company LP Agreement proposed
to facilitate the Partnership Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; and (iii) against (a) any action or agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the
Mergers set forth in Article VII of the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled,
and (b) any action which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, materially delay, materially postpone or materially adversely affect
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



Exhibit A - 5 4\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. By execution of this Agreement, each Stockholder does
hereby appoint and constitute Parent, and any one or more other individuals
designated by Parent, and each of them individually, until the Expiration Time
(at which time this proxy shall automatically be revoked), with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, as such Stockholders true and lawful
attorneys-in-fact and irrevocable proxies, to the fullest extent of such
Stockholders rights with respect to the Subject Securities beneficially owned
by such Stockholder, to vote such Subject Securities solely with respect to
the matters set forth in Section 3 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall only be effective if such Stockholder fails to be counted as
present, to consent or to vote such Stockholders Subject Securities, as
applicable, in accordance with Section 3 above. Each Stockholder intends this
proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the
Expiration Time (at which time this proxy shall automatically be revoked) for
all purposes and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by such
Stockholder with respect to its Subject Securities. Each Stockholder hereby
ratifies and confirms all actions that the proxies appointed hereunder
may lawfully do or cause to be done in accordance with this Agreement.

5\. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder_. Each Stockholder,
severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to the Parent
Parties as follows:

5.1 _Due Authority_. Such Stockholder has the legal capacity (in the case of
any Stockholder that is a natural person) and full power and authority to
make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement and to grant the
irrevocable proxy as set forth in Section 4 hereof. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of such Stockholder enforceable against him, her
or it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may
be limited by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and the effect of general principles of equity, regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity. If such Stockholder is married and the Company Stock and the Company
Units set forth on Schedule A hereto applicable to such Stockholder constitute
community property under applicable Law, such Stockholders spouse has
consented to the execution of this Agreement and has agreed to be bound by the
terms and conditions hereof by executing a Spousal Consent in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference.

5.2 _Ownership of the Company Stock and the Company Units_. As of the date
hereof, such Stockholder (i) is the beneficial or record owner of the Company
Common Stock and the Company Partnership Units indicated on _Schedule A_
hereto opposite such Stockholders name, free and clear of any and all Liens,
other than those created by this Agreement, as disclosed on _Schedule A_ or
as would not prevent such Stockholder from performing his obligations under
this Agreement, and (ii) has either sole or shared voting power over all of
the Company Stock and the Company Units beneficially owned by such
Stockholder. As of the date hereof, such Stockholder does not own,
beneficially or of record, any capital stock or other securities of the
Company or Company LP other than the Company Common Stock and the 

 



Exhibit A - 6  Company Partnership Units set forth on _Schedule A_ opposite such
Stockholders name. As of the date hereof, such Stockholder does not own,
beneficially or of record, any rights to purchase or acquire any shares of
capital stock of the Company or Company LP except as set forth on _Schedule A_
opposite such Stockholders name.

 

5.3 _No Conflict; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder do not,
and the performance by such Stockholder of the obligations under this
Agreement and the compliance by such Stockholder with any provisions hereof do
not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate in any material respect any
Laws applicable to such Stockholder, or (ii) result in any material breach of
or constitute a material default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a material default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien on any of the Company Stock or the Company Units
beneficially owned by such Stockholder pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which such Stockholder is a party or by which
such Stockholder is bound.

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person, is required by or with respect to such Stockholder in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by the
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending against, or, to the
knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened against or affecting, such
Stockholder or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective properties or
assets (including the Company Stock and the Company Units beneficially owned
by such Stockholder) at Law or in equity that could reasonably be expected to
impair or adversely affect the ability of such Stockholder to perform such
Stockholders obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

 

5.5 _Ownership of Parent Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, no Stockholder
owns, beneficially or of record, any shares of Parent Common Stock.

6\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further
force or effect immediately following the Expiration Time.

7\. _Notice of Certain Events_. Each Stockholder shall notify Parent promptly
of (a) any fact, event or circumstance that would cause, or reasonably be
expected to cause or constitute, a breach in any material respect of the
representations and warranties of such Stockholder under this Agreement and
(b) the receipt by such Stockholder of any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available to any party.

 



Exhibit A - 7 8\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

8.1 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

8.2 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Company and Company
LP shall be express third-party beneficiaries of the agreements of the
Stockholders contained in this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Amendments and Modifications_. This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

8.4 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
specific relief hereunder, including, without limitation, an injunction or
injunctions to prevent and enjoin breaches of the provisions of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any federal court
within the State of Delaware), in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled at Law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or
posting of any bond with respect to any such remedy are hereby waived.

 



Exhibit A - 8 8.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, consents, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if delivered personally, sent by overnight courier (providing proof of
delivery) to the parties or sent by facsimile or e-mail of a pdf attachment

Exhibit A - 9 8.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and performed entirely therein
by residents thereof, without regarding to any provisions relating to choice
of laws among different jurisdictions. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any other party or its successors or assigns shall be
brought and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in which case, in any federal court within the State of
Delaware), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties
agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except
in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

8.7 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARENT PARTIES AND THE SHAREHOLDER
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARENT PARTIES OR THE SHAREHOLDER IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of
the parties in respect of the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior
negotiations and understandings between the parties with respect to such
subject matter.

 

8.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

8.10 _Effect of Headings_. The section headings herein are for convenience
only and shall not affect the construction of interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



Exhibit A - 10 8.11 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (i) the Merger
Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties thereto, and (ii) this
Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties hereto.

8.12 _Legal Representation_. This Agreement was negotiated by the parties
with the benefit of legal representation and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party shall not apply to any construction or
interpretation thereof.

8.13 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense,
whether or not the Mergers are consummated.

8.14 _Action in Stockholder Capacity Only_. No Person executing this
Agreement (or designee or Representative of such Person) who has been, is or
becomes during the term of this Agreement a director, trustee, officer or
fiduciary of the Company shall be deemed to make any agreement or
understanding in this Agreement in such Persons capacity as a director,
trustee, officer or fiduciary of the Company. The parties acknowledge and
agree that this Agreement is entered into by each Stockholder solely in his,
her or its capacity as the beneficial owner or record holder of Company Stock
or Company Units and nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or affect
(or require a Stockholder to attempt to restrict, limit or affect) in any
respect any actions taken by such Stockholder or its designees or
Representatives who are a director, trustee, officer or fiduciary of the
Company in his, her or its capacity as a director, trustee, officer or
fiduciary of the Company. Neither the Stockholders nor any of their designees
or Representatives shall have any liability under this Agreement as a result
of any action or inaction by such Stockholder or its designees or
Representatives acting in his, her or its capacity as an officer,
trustee, director or fiduciary of the Company, it being understood that any
action taken (or failure to take action) by a Stockholder or its designees or
Representatives in such capacity to approve an Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have no effect on the obligations of such Stockholder under this
Agreement as the record holder or beneficial owner of Subject Securities if
this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section 8.14_ shall in any way modify,
alter or amend any of the terms of the Merger Agreement.

8.15 _Documentation and Information_. Each Stockholder consents to and
authorizes the publication and disclosure by Parent and the Company of such
Stockholders identity and holdings of the Company Stock and the Company
Units, and the nature of such Stockholders commitments, arrangements and
understandings under this Agreement, in any press release or any other
disclosure document required in connection with the Mergers or any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As promptly as practicable,
such Stockholder shall notify Parent of any required corrections with respect
to any written information supplied by such Stockholder specifically for use
in any such disclosure document, if and to the extent such Stockholder
becomes aware that any have become false or misleading in any material
respect.

Exhibit A - 17 Exhibit B

 

Form of Parent Stockholders Voting Agreement

 



Exhibit B - 1 VOTING AGREEMENT

 

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
September 4, 2013, by and among Thomas Properties Group, Inc. (" _Company_
"), Thomas Properties, L.P. (" _Company LP_ ", and, together with Company, the
" _Company Parties_ ") and TPG VI Pantera Holdings, L.P. (the " _Stockholder_
") of Parkway Properties, Inc. (the " _Parent_ ").

RECITALS

 

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company Parties,
Parent, Parkway Properties LP (" _Parent LP_ ") and PKY Masters, LP ("
_Merger Sub_ ") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") which, among other things, provides for (i) the merger
of the Company with and into Parent with Parent being the surviving entity
(the " _Parent Merger_ ") immediately after (ii) the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company LP, with Company LP continuing as the surviving entity
and a subsidiary of Parent LP (the " _Partnership Merger_ ", and together
with the Parent Merger, the " _Mergers_ ").

B. As a condition and an inducement to the Company Parties willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement, the Company Parties have required that the
Stockholder agrees, and the Stockholder has agreed to, enter into this
Agreement with respect to all common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") that the Stockholder owns, if any,
beneficially (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or of record.

 

C. The Stockholder is the beneficial or record owner, and has either sole or
shared voting power over, such number of shares of the Parent Common Stock
(the " _Parent Stock_ ") as is indicated opposite the Stockholders name on
_Schedule A_ attached hereto.

 

D. The Company desires that the Stockholder agrees, and the Stockholder is
willing to agree, subject to the limitations herein, not to Transfer (as
defined below) any of its Subject Securities (as defined below), and to vote
its Subject Securities in a manner so as to facilitate consummation of the
Parent Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Definitions._ Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement. When used in this Agreement, the following terms in all of their
tenses, cases and correlative forms shall have the meanings assigned to them
in this Section 1 or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

" _Expiration Time_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (i) the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Parent Stockholder Meeting, (ii) such
date and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Article
VIII thereof, (iii) the date that any amendment to, or waiver of, Parents
rights under the Merger 

 



Exhibit B - 2  Agreement is effected without the Stockholders consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) that increases the Exchange
Ratio or otherwise provides additional merger consideration to equityholders
of the Company Parties or (iv) the termination of this Agreement by mutual
written consent of the parties hereto.

 

" _Permitted Transfer_ " shall mean, in each case, with respect to the
Stockholder, so long as (i) such Transfer is in accordance with applicable
Law and (ii) the Stockholder is and at all times has been in compliance with
this Agreement, any Transfer of Subject Securities by the Stockholder to an
Affiliate of the Stockholder, so long as such Affiliate, in connection with
such Transfer, executes a joinder to this Agreement pursuant to which such
Affiliate agrees to become a party to this Agreement and be subject to the
restrictions applicable to the Stockholder and otherwise become a party for
all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such Transfer shall
relieve the transferring Stockholder from its obligations under this
Agreement, other than with respect to the Parent Stock transferred in
accordance with the foregoing provision.

" _Subject Securities_ " shall mean, collectively, the Parent Stock and the
New Parent Stock.

" _Transfer_ " shall mean (i) any direct or indirect offer, sale, assignment,
encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer (by
operation of Law or otherwise), either voluntary or involuntary, or entry into
any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to any
offer, sale, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition,
loan or other transfer (by operation of Law or otherwise), of any Subject
Securities (or any security convertible or exchangeable into Subject
Securities) or interest in any Subject Securities, excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, entry into this Agreement, or (ii) entering into any swap
or any other agreement, transaction or series of transactions that hedges or
transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the
economic consequence of ownership of such capital stock or interest in
capital stock, whether any such swap, agreement, transaction or series of
transactions is to be settled by delivery of securities, in cash or otherwise.
For purposes of this Agreement, "capital stock" shall include interests in a
limited partnership.

2\. _Agreement to Retain the Parent Stock_.

 

2.1 _Transfer and Encumbrance of Subject Securities_. Other than a Permitted
Transfer, hereafter until the Expiration Time, the Stockholder agrees, with
respect to any Subject Securities beneficially owned by the Stockholder, not
to (i) Transfer any such Subject Securities, or (ii) deposit any such Subject
Securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
arrangement with respect to such Subject Securities or grant any proxy (except
as otherwise provided herein) or power of attorney with respect thereto.

 

2.2 _Additional Purchases_. The Stockholder agrees that any Parent Common
Stock and other capital shares of Parent that such Stockholder purchases or
otherwise acquires or with respect to which such Stockholder otherwise
acquires sole voting power after the execution

 



Exhibit B - 3  of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Time (the " _New Parent Stock_
") shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same
extent as if they constituted the Parent Stock.

2.3 _Unpermitted Transfers_. Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Subject
Securities in violation of this Section 2 shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, be null and void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any of
the Parent Stock held by the Stockholder subject to any Lien (as set forth on
_Schedule A_ hereto) become subject to foreclosure, forfeiture or other
similar proceedings, thereby causing the Stockholder to be unable to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement with respect to such securities,
the Stockholder shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement with
respect to the Stockholders obligations with respect to such Parent Stock.

 

3\. _Agreement to Vote and Approve_. Hereafter until the Expiration Time, at
every meeting of the stockholders of Parent called with respect to any of the
following matters, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on
every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of Parent with
respect to any of the following matters, the Stockholder shall, or
shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to (including
via proxy), vote the Parent Stock and any New Parent Stock owned by the
Stockholder: (i) in favor of (a) the Parent Merger, and (b) the amendment to
the Parents charter increasing Parents authorized shares of capital stock
as contemplated by the Merger Agreement (such amendment, the " _Proposed
Amendment_ "), and (ii) against (a) any action or agreement that
would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the consummation
of the Mergers set forth in Article VII of the Merger Agreement not being
fulfilled, and (b) any action which could reasonably be expected to materially
delay, materially postpone or materially adversely affect consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Agreement shall require the Stockholder to, or cause the
holder of record to (including via proxy), vote the Parent Stock and any New
Parent Stock owned by the Stockholder in favor of any supplement, amendment to
or amendment and restatement of the charter of Parent other than the Proposed
Amendment.

 

4\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. By execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder does
hereby appoint and constitute the Company, until the Expiration Time (at
which time this proxy shall automatically be revoked), with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, as the Stockholders true and lawful
attorneys-in-fact and irrevocable proxies, to the fullest extent of
the Stockholders rights with respect to the Subject Securities beneficially
owned by the Stockholder, to vote such Subject Securities solely with respect
to the matters set forth in Section 3 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall only be effective if the Stockholder fails to be counted
as present, to consent or to vote the Stockholders Subject Securities, as
applicable, in accordance with Section 3 above. The Stockholder intends this
proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the
Expiration Time (at which time this proxy shall automatically be revoked) for
all purposes and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by the
Stockholder with respect to its Subject Securities. Each Stockholder hereby
ratifies and confirms all actions that the proxies appointed hereunder may
lawfully do or cause to be done in accordance with this Agreement.

 



Exhibit B - 4 5\. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder_. The Stockholder
hereby represents and warrants to the Company Parties as follows:

5.1 _Due Authority_. The Stockholder has the full power and authority to make,
enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement and to grant the
irrevocable proxy as set forth in Section 4 hereof. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Stockholder enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited
by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium
or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and
the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity.

 

5.2 _Ownership of the Parent Stock_. As of the date hereof, the Stockholder
(i) is the beneficial or record owner of the Parent Common Stock indicated on
_Schedule A_ hereto opposite the Stockholders name, free and clear of any and
all Liens, other than those created by this Agreement, as disclosed on
_Schedule A_ or as would not prevent the Stockholder from performing its
obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) has sole voting power over all of
the Parent Stock beneficially owned by the Stockholder. As of the date hereof,
the Stockholder does not own, beneficially or of record, any capital stock or
other securities of Parent other than the Parent Common Stock set forth on
_Schedule A_ opposite the Stockholders name. As of the date hereof, the
Stockholder does not own, beneficially or of record, any rights to purchase
or acquire any shares of capital stock of Parent except as set forth on
_Schedule A_ opposite the Stockholders name.

5.3 _No Conflict; Consents_.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder does not,
and the performance by the Stockholder of the obligations under this
Agreement and the compliance by the Stockholder with any provisions hereof do
not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate in any material respect any
Laws applicable to the Stockholder, or (ii) result in any material breach of
or constitute a material default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a material default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien on any of the Parent Stock beneficially owned by the
Stockholder pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument
or obligation to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder
is bound.

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, is
required by or with respect to the Stockholder in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by the
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending against, or, to the
knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against or affecting, the
Stockholder that could reasonably be expected to materially impair or
materially adversely affect the ability of such Stockholder to perform such
Stockholders obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

 



Exhibit B - 5 5.5 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, the
Stockholder does not own, beneficially or of record, any shares of Company
Common Stock.

6\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further
force or effect immediately as of and following the Expiration Time.

7\. _Notice of Certain Events_. The Stockholder shall notify the Company
promptly of (a) any fact, event or circumstance that would cause, or
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute, a breach in any material
respect of the representations and warranties of the Stockholder under
this Agreement and (b) the receipt by the Stockholder of any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to any party.

8.  _Miscellaneous_.

8.1 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible. 

8.2 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Parent and Parent LP
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of the agreements of the
Stockholder contained in this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Amendments and Modifications_. This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

8.4 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
specific relief hereunder, including, without limitation, an injunction or
injunctions to prevent and enjoin breaches of the provisions of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of

jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any federal court

 



Exhibit B - 6  within the State of Delaware), in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled at Law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or
posting of any bond with respect to any such remedy are hereby waived.

and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties agrees not to commence

to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice
as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for
any

 



Exhibit B - 8  reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or
(iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts.

 

8.7 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE COMPANY PARTIES AND THE SHAREHOLDER
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY PARTIES OR THE SHAREHOLDER IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of
the parties in respect of the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior
negotiations and understandings between the parties with respect to such
subject matter.

 

8.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,

constitute one and the same agreement.

8.10 _Effect of Headings_. The section headings herein are for convenience
only and shall not affect the construction of interpretation of this
Agreement.

8.11 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (i) the Merger
Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties thereto, and (ii) this
Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties hereto.

 

8.12 _Legal Representation_. This Agreement was negotiated by the parties with
the benefit of legal representation and any rule of construction or

interpretation thereof.

 

8.13 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense, whether
or not the Mergers are consummated; provided that if the Mergers are
consummated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, any costs or
expenses incurred by the Stockholder in connection with this Agreement shall

Services Agreement dated as of June 5, 2012 by and between Parent and TPG VI

Exhibit B - 9 8.14 _Action in Stockholder Capacity Only_. No Person executing this Agreement
(or designee or Representative of such Person) who has been, is or becomes
during the term of this Agreement a director, trustee, officer or fiduciary of
Parent or Parent LP shall be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in
this Agreement in such Persons capacity as a director, trustee, officer or
fiduciary of Parent or Parent LP. The parties acknowledge and agree that this
Agreement is entered into by the Stockholder solely in its capacity as the
beneficial owner or record holder of Parent Stock and nothing in this
Agreement shall restrict, limit or affect (or require the Stockholder to
attempt to restrict, limit or affect) in any respect any actions taken by the
Stockholder or its designees or Representatives who are a director, trustee,
officer or fiduciary of Parent or Parent LP in his, her or its capacity as a
director, trustee, officer or fiduciary of Parent or Parent LP. Neither the
Stockholder nor any of its designees or Representatives shall have
any liability under this Agreement as a result of any action or inaction by
such Stockholder or its designees or Representatives acting in his, her or its
capacity as an officer, trustee, director or fiduciary of Parent or Parent LP,
it being understood that any action taken (or failure to take action) by the
Stockholder or its designees or Representatives in such capacity to approve a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall have no effect on the obligations
of the Stockholder under this Agreement as the record holder or beneficial
owner of Subject Securities if this Agreement has not been terminated in
accordance with its terms. It is expressly understood that the Stockholder is
not making any agreement or understanding in its capacity as, or on behalf of
any designee or Representative of the Stockholder who is a director, trustee,
officer or fiduciary of Parent or Parent LP. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.14_ shall in any way modify, alter or amend any
of the terms of the Merger Agreement.

8.15 _Documentation and Information_. The Stockholder consents to
and authorizes the publication and disclosure by Parent and the Company of

the Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement, in any press release or any other disclosure document required in
connection with the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. As promptly as reasonably practicable, the Stockholder shall
notify Parent and the Company of any required corrections with respect to any
written information supplied by the Stockholder specifically for use in any
such disclosure document, if and to the extent the Stockholder becomes aware
that any have become false or misleading in any material respect.

8.16 _Limited Liability of Partners_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no member or general partner or limited partner of any
member, nor any future member or general partner or limited partner of nay
future member, shall have any personal liability for the performance of any
obligation of the Stockholder under this Agreement. Any liability of the
Stockholder for money damages under this agreement shall be satisfied solely
out of the assets of the Stockholder.

Exhibit C - 6 Exhibit D

 

Form of JAT Side Letter

 



Exhibit D - 1 September 4, 2013

 

Mr. James A. Thomas

515 South Flower Street, 6th Floor

Los Angles, California 90071

Dear Mr. Thomas: 

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September
4, 2013 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Parkway Properties, Inc.
("Parent"), Parkway Properties LP ("Parent LP"), PK Masters, LP, Thomas
Properties, Inc. (the "Company") and Thomas Properties Group, L.P. ("Company
LP"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

In connection with the Merger Agreement, we propose the following:



   1. | _Severance_. As of the Parent Merger Effective Time, your
employment with the Company and Company LP shall terminate, with such
termination being treated as a termination of employment following a Change in
Control (as such term is defined in the Employment Agreement) qualifying you
for the payments and benefits set forth in Section 5 of the Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement between you, the Company and Company LP, dated
as of December 18, 2008, and amended as of January 1, 2011 (the "Employment
Agreement"). Parent shall succeed to the Companys responsibility with respect
to all payments and benefits under this Section 1\. 
---|--- 
 



   2. | _Chairman_. We shall take all necessary action to cause, as of
the Parent Merger Effective Time, you to be appointed Chairman of the Parent
Board. 
---|--- 
 



   3. | _Renomination Rights; Support Services_. So long as you continue
to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Limited Voting Stock owned
by you immediately following the Parent Effective Time (subject to appropriate
adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, subdivision
or reorganization, recapitalization or similar event), we shall include you in
the slate of nominees recommended by the Parent Board to Parent stockholders,
and included in the related proxy statement, for election to the Parent Board
at the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders of Parent, and if you are so
elected shall cause you to be reappointed as Chairman of the Parent Board for
an additional one-year term expiring at the 2015 annual meeting of
stockholders of Parent. In consideration for your services on the Parent
Board, you shall be entitled to receive from Parent the cash, equity and
other compensation payable to a non-employee director who is a non-executive
Chairman of the Board, as set forth in Parents policies for compensation of
directors approved from time to time by the Parent Board or the Compensation
Committee of the Parent Board. 
---|--- 
 



Exhibit D - 2 Furthermore, so long as you are a member of the Parent Board, we shall provide
you with offices at the location of your choice not to exceed 700 square feet
for you and a secretary of your choice and shall provide all computers,
printers and other office equipment reasonably necessary for you to conduct
business from that location. We shall convey ownership to you of all
computers, printers and other office equipment that occupy the current offices
of both you and your secretary. It is acknowledged that you personally own all
of the furniture, paintings and other personal effects that occupy your
current office, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates have any
interest or ownership therein. We shall reimburse you for any reasonable costs
related to relocating such computers, printers, other office equipment,
furniture, paintings and other personal effects to your new office.



   4. | _Rights to Names and Marks; Other Property_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | No later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the
Closing Date, Parent and Parent LP shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, change their names and cause their certificates
of incorporation (or equivalent organizational documents), as applicable, to
be amended to the extent necessary to remove any reference to "Thomas
Properties," "Thomas," "TPG" or any similar name or mark, including, without
limitation, any "doing business as" or fictitious business names, any logos,
designs or tag lines and any URLs or domain names (the "Names and Marks"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Following the Closing, Parent and Parent LP shall, and shall
cause, each of their respective Subsidiaries to, as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the
Closing Date, cease to make any use of or to license the Names and Marks. In
furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable but in no event later than one
hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Parent and Parent LP
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, destroy or
deliver, at Thomas option, to Thomas all business cards, schedules,

manuals, forms, websites and other materials that include the Names and
Marks, and remove, strike over, or otherwise obliterate the Names and Marks
from all other assets and other materials owned or used by such Persons.

respective Subsidiaries owns or possesses any right, title or interest in the
Names and Marks, effective as of the Parent Merger Effective Time, Parent
and Parent LP hereby assign, shall assign, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to assign, all such right, title, and interest
therein, along with any related goodwill, to Thomas or his designee. 
---|---|--- 
 



   5. |

_Registration Rights Agreement_. Each of Parent and Parent LP acknowledges
that you and the Thomas Investors are parties to that certain Registration
Rights Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2004, among the Company, Company LP
and the Thomas Investors (as defined in _Exhibit A_ hereto), which contains
certain rights in favor of you and the other Thomas Investors that
are intended to survive consummation of the Mergers. Each of 

---|--- 
 



Exhibit D - 3 Registration Rights Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Mergers
and that Parent and Parent LP shall comply in all respects with the terms and
provisions of such Registration Rights Agreement as it relates to Thomas and
such Thomas Investors. 
---|--- 



   6. | _Stockholders Agreement_. The parties hereto acknowledge that you
and the other Thomas Investors are parties to that certain Stockholders
Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2012, by and among the Company, you,
the Thomas Investors, MIRELF IV TPGI, LLC and MIRELF IV TPGI II, LLC (the "
_Stockholders Agreement_ "), which provides for certain additional matters
relating to a Company Sale (as that term is defined therein). Pursuant
to Section 2.9 of the Stockholders Agreement, the determination of whether
the Mergers are allowable under Section 2.9(b) is to be made by you. You
hereby confirm that the Mergers are allowable under Section 2.9(b), and you
and the Thomas Investors waive any noncompliance with the provisions of
Section 2.9 as it relates to the Mergers. Furthermore, you and the other
Thomas Parties acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to Section 6.13 thereof,
upon the closing of the Parent Merger, the Stockholders Agreement shall
terminate automatically without any further action and shall be of no further
force or effect. 
---|--- 



   7. | _Tax Protection Agreement; Commerce Square_. The parties
acknowledge that you and the other Thomas Parties are parties to that certain
Contribution Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2004, among Company LP
and the Thomas Investors, including without limitation, Exhibit F (Sale
Limitations and Debt Guarantees) thereto (the " _Tax Protection Agreement_ "),
which imposes certain restrictions on the Companys ability to engage in the
sale or exchange of certain assets of the Company known as One Commerce
Square (" _OCS_ ") and Two Commerce Square (" _TCS_ "). 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Tax Protection Agreement, following the
Mergers, you and the other Thomas Investors acknowledge and agree that Parent
LP may enter into a transaction (as more fully described below, on Exhibit A
hereto and in the Redemption Agreement (as defined in Exhibit A), the " _BDN
Transaction_ ") in which BDN acquires all of the interests then
held, directly or indirectly, by Parent LP, in the Commerce Partnerships,
with the result being that BDN will become the owner, directly or indirectly,
of a 99% interest in each Commerce Partnership provided that the terms of the
BDN Transaction satisfy the requirements set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto (it
being acknowledged that _Exhibit A_ does not describe all of the agreed terms
for the BDN Transaction and that additional agreed terms of the BDN
Transaction are described in the Redemption Agreement. The BDN Transaction
may be structured as a sale or as a redemption of interests. If the
requirements of the BDN Transaction are satisfied, the parties hereto agree
that the Tax Protection Agreement will be amended so that (i) the "Guarantee
Amount" shall be $39 million, allocated among the Thomas Investors as
designated by you, (ii) Article 2 thereof (and other terms therein related to
Article 2) will be of no further force or effect, and (iii) the first
sentence of Article 3(c) shall be amended to insert the words "or a change in
applicable law with respect thereto" for the avoidance of doubt. During the
"Protected Period" (as defined in the Tax Protection Agreement), so long as
(i) Parent LP owns the City West Place and/or San Felipe Plaza properties, and
(ii) one or more mortgage loans are secured by the City West Place and/or

 



Exhibit D - 4  San Felipe Plaza properties, then Parent LP shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to the Thomas Parties the opportunity to
make a guarantee of either or both of such mortgage loans, in an aggregate
amount up to Guarantee Amount, as elected by the Thomas Parties in their
discretion. The Thomas Parties will notify Parent of their election as to
which of these mortgage loan(s) the Thomas Parties elect to provide such
guaranties. Any guarantee entered into pursuant to this paragraph shall be
deemed to be a guarantee of Qualifying Debt entered into in accordance with
Article 3 of the Tax Protection Agreement. If, for any reason, the mortgage
loans on CityWest Place and/or San Felipe Plaza are no longer available to
the Thomas Parties to provide a guaranty up to the Guarantee Amount, then the
provisions of the Tax Protection Agreement shall govern with respect to the
obligation of Parent LP to provide one or more replacement loans for such
purpose.

In addition, if the terms of the BDN Transaction satisfy the requirements of
_Exhibit A_  hereto in all material respects, the Thomas Parties agree (x) to
execute and deliver such agreements, including limited partnership agreement
amendments, limited liability company agreement amendments, debt guarantees,
contribution agreements, and other documents referred to in this Agreement,
in _Exhibit A_ hereto or in the Redemption Agreement or as may otherwise be
reasonably required to give effect to the BDN Transaction, (y) to take such
actions described as being taken by them in this Agreement, in _Exhibit A_
hereto or in the Redemption Agreement or as may otherwise be reasonably
required to consummate the BDN Transaction, and (z) to cooperate in good faith
with Parent LP and BDN OP (as defined in the Redemption Agreement) in order
to cause the BDN Transaction to be consummated in accordance with the
Redemption Agreement and _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 

Each of the Thomas Parties acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the Tax
Protection Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement or elsewhere, none of the
Company, Company LP, Parent, Parent LP, their respective affiliates, and/or
any of their any respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents,
and representatives (together the " _Parent Released Parties_ ") shall have
any liability to any of the Thomas Parties under the Tax Protection Agreement
or under the Stockholders Agreement for any taxes (including additions,
additional amounts, penalties and interest), claims, liabilities, damages,
expenses, losses, or other amounts (collectively, " _Damages_ "), and hereby
waive any action or claim for Damages, and hereby release the Parent Released
Parties for any liability for Damages, in either case such that may arise as
a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the BDN
Transactions.

Each of the Thomas Parties shall cooperate with Parent, Parent LP and BDN for
the purposes of providing information to Parent, Parent LP, and BDN related to
the tax treatment and consequences with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Redemption Agreement and the ownership by Parent, Parent
LP, BDN and the Thomas Parties of direct and indirect interests in OCS, TCS,
the OCS Entity, and the TCS Entity.



   8. | _Partnership Units_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | After the Partnership Merger, Parent LP will use the
"traditional method without curative allocations" set forth in Treas. Reg.
Section 1.704-3(b) for Company LP properties treated as contributed to Parent
LP in the Partnership Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit D - 5 Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, at any time when Mr. Thomas and
his Affiliates that receive Parent LP Units in the Partnership Merger
(the "Thomas Investors") continue to own collectively at least 50% of the
Parent LP Units owned by them immediately following the Parent Merger
Effective Time (subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, subdivision or reorganization, recapitalization
or similar event), Parent is a party to a Termination Transaction (as defined
in the Parent Partnership Agreement) as a result of which the holders of
Parent Common Stock do not receive shares that are listed for trading on a
national securities exchange (a "Going Private Transaction"), Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the acquiring entity in such transaction
to offer to the Thomas Investors the opportunity to receive, in exchange for
their Parent LP Units in such transaction, a preferred limited partnership
interest or preferred limited liability company membership interest in Parent
LP or the surviving entity of a merger with Parent LP that (i) has a
liquidation preference over the common equity interests in such entity equal
to the value of the consideration that would have been received in exchange
for such Parent LP Units if they had been exchanged for Parent Common Stock
immediately before consummation of Going Private Transaction, (ii) bears a
dividend rate that the Parent Board, in its good faith judgment after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors, shall have determined to be a
market rate for such preferred interest. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Parent agrees that if you or your Affiliates exercise your
redemption rights in accordance with Section 8.6 of the Parent Partnership
Agreement with respect to your or their Parent LP Units, Parent will
exercise its right under Section 8.6(b) thereof to elect to acquire such
Parent LP Units in exchange for the REIT Shares Amount (as such term is
defined in the Parent LP Agreement), subject to Section 8.6(e) thereof. 
---|---|--- 
 



   9. | _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto (including the Thomas Parties) shall take such further actions as may
be required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to
the obligations and efforts contemplated by this letter agreement. 
---|--- 



   10. | _Miscellaneous_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
letter agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this letter agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this letter agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 
---|---|---

benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of
this letter agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof
or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to specific relief hereunder, including, without limitation, an
injunction or injunctions to prevent and enjoin breaches of the provisions of
this letter agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case,
in any federal court within the State of Delaware), in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or in equity. Any requirements for
the securing or posting of any bond with respect to any such remedy are
hereby waived. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, consents, demands
and other communications under this letter agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed given if delivered personally, sent by overnight
courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the addresses set
forth above (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by
like notice).

     | (f) | _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue_. This letter
agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and
performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regarding to any
provisions relating to choice of laws among different jurisdictions. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | _Entire Agreement_. This letter agreement contains the

and supersedes all prior negotiations and understandings between the parties

the foregoing, and to provide the Thomas Investors with the rights that are
provided to "TPG Partners" with respect to "TPG Retained Interests," as
specified in (and as such terms are defined in) the Commerce Square
Agreements, including, without limitation, the following:

(a) the Majority Partner will have the right (the " _Call Right_ "), but not
the obligation, to purchase all but not less than all of the Thomas Investors
interests in the Commerce Partnerships at any time on or after October 31,
2021, for a cash purchase price equal to the fair market value of such
interests at the time such Call Right is exercised, determined by mutual
agreement, or if the parties fail to agree within 30 days, through an
appraisal process pursuant to which each party will select an appraiser
experienced in valuation of commercial office real estate and partnership
interests in the City of Philadelphia; these two appraisers will select a
third appraiser experienced in valuation of commercial office real estate
and partnership interests in the City of Philadelphia; each of the three
appraisers will make their own separate appraisals of the fair market value of
the Thomas Investor interests, within 60 days after the selection of the third
appraiser; the fair market value of the Thomas Investor interests will be the
average of the results of the two appraisals with values that are closest to
each other; if one of the values represents the average of the other two
appraised values, the value in the middle shall be the fair market value of
the Thomas Investor interests; and each party shall bear the costs of the
appraisal process equally;

(b) the Thomas Investors shall have the right to approve any financing or
refinancing of the applicable Commerce Project if such financing or
refinancing would result in an amount of mortgage debt on the applicable
Commerce Project aggregating less than $130,000,000 (for One Commerce Square)
or $107,850,000 (for Two Commerce Square), which approval must be reasonable
in light of the amount of refinancing mortgage debt available on commercially
reasonable terms to the relevant Commerce Partnership at the time, taking
into account the value of such Commerce Project;

(c) the Thomas Investors shall not be obligated or entitled to contribute any
additional capital to the Commerce Partnerships (except pursuant to the
contribution agreements described in paragraph 4 below);

 

(d) the Thomas Investors interests shall not be diluted unless either (i) the
interests of all other partners are diluted on a proportionate basis, taking
into account the respective amounts of additional capital contributions to the
Commerce Partnership made by the partners, including the Thomas Investors, or
(ii) the Majority Partner commits in writing to the Thomas Investors to
exercise the Call Right in a timely manner; and

(e) the Thomas Investors shall have the right to transfer their interests
to one or more of their affiliates upon notice to the Commerce Partnership,
but without the consent of any other partner, at any time; and in the event of
such a transfer, the transferee(s) shall be bound by all of the provisions of
the applicable Commerce Square Agreement.

 



Exhibit D - 10 4\. Concurrently with the closing of the BDN Transaction, at the request of
BDN, the Thomas Investors that are parties to the contribution agreements
with Company LP that were entered into by the Thomas Investors for the benefit
of the mortgage lenders for each Commerce Partnership will be amended so that
Company LP will no longer be a party, and such Thomas Investors will instead
agree to make contributions to the applicable Commerce Partnership (which in
turn will agree to apply such contributions to the repayment of mortgage debt
of the applicable Commerce Partnership) on substantially the same terms and
conditions as are set forth in the existing contribution agreements, except
that the maximum liability under such new contribution agreements shall be
equal to (a) $126 million with respect to the mortgage loan on that certain
office building project known as One Commerce Square, located at 2005 Market
Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and (b) an amount not to exceed $100
million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loan on
that certain office building project known as Two Commerce Square, located at
2001 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

5\. BDN shall agree for the benefit of the Thomas Investors to restrictions
on sales of the Commerce Projects that are substantially the same as those set

regard to the amendment described in this Letter Agreement), with a Protected
Period ending on October 31, 2021.
